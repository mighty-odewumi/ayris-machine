1. Walk The Path Of Sorrow

In the Devoid of Sorrow
The Air and my Heart full of Luster

Behind the Mountains
There must be a key to the Gates

Right passed easy Talk
We can once again walk the Path of Sorrow
Let the Turn of Search bring you away

Ahhhhh!

Two Shades of the Midnight Fire
In the Night Sky
You waiting Child walk with me
Walk by Side of Fall
The Essence to open those Gates
And still we must walk the Path of Sorrow


2. Dark Medieval Times

The secret Lights in the Sky
Vision
All one
It seems

The Blades are sharpened
They will all learn
Yes, Destroy your Dream
Your Desert of Dreams
It's undeserved
For Dark Medieval Times

Here, upon the Hill
You all find Wisdom

Waiting for a lot of
Endless screaming

Ending

Desert of Dreams
Eternity in your Dreams
Here you are
Dark Medieval Times


3. Skyggedans (Shadowdance)



4. Min Hyllest Til Vinterland (My Tribute To The Winterland)

Vi er vikinger av det kalde vinter
land en trone av svarte sjeler


5. Into The Mighty Forest

As I walk
With a Spirit
Into the binding Forest

In Fog and Darkness
I walk
I disappear
Into the mighty Forest

It's beyond the sweet
And tainted Landscapes
The Shadow walking

Your Sanctity
Soughts the Story
Of Generations

Wah!


6. The Dark Castle In The Deep Forest

Dark Forest Trees over the Funeral,
All day the Army ride
They moved in deeper
So Dark that they weren't even...
Too lead us passed this wicked Dense
I can fell the Presence of the Shadowthrone in the deepest Dark
When cold Winds Freeze
When Night came and dark Fog came over me
Let that Horde come to me
As they walk right by
When all the Death is near
I wander eternally
Invincible Fog is near
We walk the Fields of War
The Cloak of the Moon it can slip all them through
And the Flame is the Wrath of his Sword

5. Dominions Of Satyricon
6. The King Of The Shadowthrone

1. Hvite Krists Død

[Satyr:] Kampen mot Gud og hvitekrist er igang!

Evig minnes vi de tapre som levde under vår hordes hammer
Evig er krigen mot de av lyset, til de míter dødens ansikt, dødens kulde
Vinder av kulde skal komme, for å fryse kristenmanns blod

Vært korstog har begynt og hvert skritt er en stake gjennom hvite krists hjerte

Vl brenner guds barn på bålet
Vl brenner guds hus
Tidens mírke skal dekke for solen
Perleporten skal knuses

Og hver torne i hans skalle, hver spiker i hans kropp gir liv til nye
Sjeler fodt under dødens mektige trone

Vi går vårt dødningtog til dødens land med de endelíse vidder
Når korsfarerne dingler og hvite krists ånd er død
Når månen skinner blek og ensom, skal lyden av en dødsmarsj bestige
nordens mekrige fjell

Borte var de av guds jord, bak en mørk sky månen så rå og kald
Sungen er siste tone av en gravsang


2. In The Mist By The Hills

In the mist of the shadows by the river of the fogpalace
Two great spears and a flag of dominion and hate
Over the chasm riders of doom

And sometimes the water dares to reflect...
As days pass by and the light is becoming weaker
I can watch the death of the sun from my enormous view
Still sometimes I thought my own eyes were deceiving me

Many a misty morning's battle. Further on more experience
Soon it's time to hear the sound of the horn in far distance
The deathtone call for war

In the mist by the hills the day darkens
In this forest death rules
Over this chasm riders of doom and face him with a deadly pale spectre face
Grim as stone, ride to the deathfields... Blackness and doom
A total eclipse of the sun
Die by the northern triology in the mist by the hills


3. Woods To Eternity

In grey depressive autumn times I wander the woods to eternity searching for
him trying to remember while the same shy still rules the night
We knew then. That these were the children of god
The ones who betrayed me and my desire

This must be the desolate land. this is the kingdom of the shadowthrone
centuries have gone beyond time, and we in the land beyond the forest, we
burnt them in the purgatory, them the children of god. Barely forgotten these
times are, but not for a soul whose rest hasn't been found.


4. Vikingland

Langt inn i mellom hoye fjell og dype daler
Gjennom norske skoger og mørke huter
Bak her en drøm for over tasen år siden
Til hordaland kom pesta og bragte død og pine
Thekseskogen ble plantet røtter for et rike som skulle komme

Hedningenes land vikingland
Svarte sjelers land vikingland

Mens telemarks fosser og bekker enda renner i strie strímmer som
Evigheten selv

En ny tid kom hår turdenbrakene dundret og jorden skalv
Som når trollene kriger om høm som skal herske ijotanheimen

En ny tid kont... Hvor vinteren blåser og pisker
Det er ikke ly å finne for den ensomme
Pandere som måtte søke fred i nordland

Her oppe på fjeller ved inidnattsilden kan man endu se
De komme som ville dyr ut av skogsmørket
Over trellberg...


5. Dominions Of Satyricon

From beyond come the storms
Landscapes turn to ash before my pressured eyes
Nothingness turns to nothingness
And my imagination fades like dustclouds over
This deserted land feel to now satyricon
Wonder how stormclouds rage
And all you can feel is the cold winds of
Funeral times, timeless they are

He saw lived and died
In these dreams of demons
Wondering how he could open the gate to
Dark medieval times and bring forth to the domains
of satyricon, two great spears and a flag of dominion
And hate

Above it all creations fall
Living for the quest and the search
Dying for the key, living for the domains
Arise northern spirit and come forth under
The might of the castle satyricon


6. The King Of The Shadowthrone

He wander the fields of death... In eternity wandering our own path
Which has been the quest of immortality
Yet to conquer for me, but dreams shall not be torn

He is spirit
He is stone
And he is immortality
The king of the shadowthrone

And even the conqueror (of death)
Fell as a stone from the mountain
And time led to destruction
Once he left, he knew then in the past
That the seeds should be worthless
Spirit rise from your rest and return for them

I am spirit
I am stone
And I am immortal

2. The Forest Is My Throne
3. Min Hyllest Til Vinterland (My Tribute To The Winterland)
4. The Night Of The Triumphator

1. Black Winds

Summon thy hidden wisdom, gather the unholy hate
Winter is at hand, frozen my tears will be
Created by blasphemy
The edge of my sword, the powers of my mind

Winter is at hand, as two torches blaze in the dark
A warrior dressed in black, granted eternal life
Black winds blow my hair, as the voice of the night
Whispers my name

Blackened ground, misty sound
Hear the call for war, the master calling his
Warriors to explore by the sign of the horns
As the dawn arises the souls of a thousand
Young men shall go wild
As the fire shines into the night they're sitting by
The campfires awaiting the dawn


2. The Forest Is My Throne

Through years of knowledge, man rode the wings of evil
Through the enormous winter, three years without summer
Prepared for the battles of the north

I sat on my throne and watched between
The skies of a cold northern light
Knowing this was my ground, but those who turned their backs
Against my throne, only got my sword on their back!

I rose from my throne, and walked away with the wind
Through centuries of weakness
Only the strong follow me, on my crusade of darkness
In this land where the forest is my throne
I have come to re-hunt

4. The Night Of The Triumphator

Come come infernal war awake beasts of hell
free yourself from the chains that have been holding you for 666 years
We await sodomy and destruction

It is the night of the triumphator (starts the burning of heaven)

On this night in the pentagrams power we shoot the angels down from the sky
(and we) sodomize the dirty whores of babylon... on christian ground

On this night we torture the betrayers
Night night holy night of the triumphator
(rape the nuns, hang the priests, cut the throat of the crying christians)

1. The Dawn Of A New Age

This is Armageddon

"And I looked, and behold a pale horse:
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him. And power was given
Unto them over the fourth part of the earth,
To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death,
And with the beasts of the earth".

And then again "I saw and beheld, a black horse;
And he that sat on him had a scythe; And a crown
Was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black
As sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.

And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,
Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs,
When she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven
Departed as a scroll when it is rolled together,
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Almighty mountains and rocks, I beg you fall on them.

For the great day of wrath is coming, and who shall be able to stand?

[From The Book of Revelations: Edited and partly re-written by Satyr.]


2. Forhekset

Forhekset av tidenes vind, Besatt av Nattens kolde gufs
Under ravnsvart himmel de bedriver Blodskam og hor
Med skingrende stemmer de pækaller Dypets makter
I en sirkel bundet av Grimme visjoner

Bæret av dyrets Glans, Omfavnet av dídens vinger
Av det dypeste hat i det sorteste av det morke
I en eng av torner... Næ i fullmænens besettende lys

De nagler englene til jorden med sjel og kropp
Kaos hersker over de hvite domener
Profetier blir oppfylt
Jorden stær i et hav av flammer


3. Mother North

Mother north - how can they sleep while their beds are burning?
Mother north - your fields are bleeding

Memories... The invisible wounds
Pictures that enshrine your throne (gone?)

A Future benighted still they are blind
Pigeonhearted beings of flesh and blood
Keeps closing their eyes for the dangers that threat... ourselves and our nature
And that is why
They all enrage me

Sometimes in the dead of the night I mesmerize my soul
Sights and visions prophecies and horror
They all come in one

Mother north - united we stand (together we walk)
Phantom north - I'll be there when you hunt them down


4. Du Som Hater Gud

Du som hater gud og kristent liv
Fíler hans n'rv'r som en bitter kreft
Her mæ det skjendes og skjendes kvasst
Himmerikets enger dynket i blod

Hater av gud
Og lyspesten

Se inn i guds lamme íyne
Sæ soytter de i hans æsyn
Slæ i hjel hans ynkelige lam
Med klibbe

Gud med diff og dine
Har du lagt mitt norgesrike i ruiner
Fordumstiders staute skikk og bruk
Kvestet du med dine stygge ord
Næ skal du bort fra vær mark


5. Immortality Passion

I am the beast in passionate pain
I am the grim being of the highlands
Of the other side...
I am winter when you freeze
I am the hammer and you are the anvil

Forever in warfare my heart is
With my passion of despair
Still though I was there when the hills were born
And when the wind blew for the first time
So there are reasons for my existence

Seems like I dwell in a circle
Somewhere in the Nordic Hemisphere

Where the howling winds rage
And the mountains are majestic
I can breathe and where there is
Human flesh I feel strangled

Open the gate to immortality
I stand proud awaiting the glory
Of a new morning... darkness


6. Nemesis Divina

Eder har gjort vårt rike raattent
Eder har gjort vårt gull rustent
Og flammene fra de veldige sletter alt vi har å minnes
fra verdig manns tid

Eder har bragt i -- i kvalmende lys i dragens hule
Eder har malt kors på hammer
Og vi har siktet pilen -- pilen på menneskesønnens -- menneskesønnens usle trone

Nemesis divina splinten i øyet på jehova sager
Nemesis divina kniven i hjertet på guds sønn

Eder har bragt oelsk til fiende
Eder har gjort ravn til due
Men def olme øyet er vendf mot eder
og hevnens klokke ringer
ringer

Eder er vitnesbyrd
om brente broer og glemte sanger
Eder er barn hjertig hetens fedre
og milleniumspestens budbringere
Dog skal en dag nå komme

da eder bårn i tre skal henge

Nemesis divina splinten i øyet på jehova
Nemesis divina kniven i hjertet på guds sønn

For stridsmenn har nå hevet øksøn og bespotølsøns tegn æ reist
Nemesis divina - før strawøn må komme

1. Tied In Bronze Chains

Sinful woman walk with me cause I'm the wolf on your shoulder
but complain not to me, cause I'm the accuser
If you dare to withhold the immense power and the greed
you shall walk among us to subterranean fields

Why don't you come with me
and dance the snake pit dance
rhythmic moves to the eerie bells, the boiling blood
evils breath on your neck, the morbid rite
I'm tied in bronze chains
(so) where do all the flowers come from (in October 1997)
I am tired, should I care anymore?
The rusty claws who reach for me are too far away
sense no anger for that, be at one
The sleaze on the Wall is all gone (anyway)
it's just flowers, flowers
Come, come let's join the orgy
decay and wine, sodomy all the way
no rest for the holy
forbidden fruit is always best
dirt 'n filth tastes so good

I see the cross of Peter overwhelming their coward countenance
Oh you're so damned clean, now take my dirty whore, hell fire is inside her
contaminate the clean, woman. Let him feel you're venom
It's the only way to release the chains
My candle is burning at both ends, I just want to be released before I go
It's a harsh voyage, to the land of sin
I had to make sure to bring 'em down with me
I am the last of my kind and I'm tied in bronze chains


2. Filthgrinder

Filthgrinder, no-love machine, cleaner
unknown to remorse and pity
cynical, electric fuckin' murderer

What a scenery, the heavy pulse beat of the
Unholy Alliance and the white fear
Take a look around and understand, (that) your days are numbered
the demon on the Wall and the ticking clock
closing in (on that final) grasp for air, do you still believe?
The future beast is rising and tyranny has come for 777 years
reach out for mercy, it's just a bygone anyway
Filthgrinder - practice aggression
Filthgrinder - protect the wealth of the Elite
Filthgrinder - tremble upon the ugly
True-born creature, twist that Firm grasp of yours
like in days of old
He can feel it, he knows they can't
to be in league with the underworld can't be mistaken
you don't believe, you know!
He chants a primitive gospel, so very hard
Yeah!
The mechanisms of destructive behaviour can be an art form in itself
The beast risen represents no so called dark mercy
evil knows no good, good knows no evil
but a saviour he is in all forms, but religious
a Grand engine carrying years of built up Hatred
and Powers. You know that, isn't that why I can smell your fear?
Your heart trying to rip its way through your chest

Filthgrinder a beastified being risen from the collective
hatred of an oppressed people.
A people representing Pride, Dignity and Honour!


3. Rhapsody In Filth

[Instrumental]



4. Havoc Vulture

Wonder how it would be to be the great Redeemer
the one to bestow upon you life and death
the one to poison you when you're down
or to be the one to hand you the crown of thorns
when your hands are sore
(and) to save you from the everything you care for
Are you bitter when you see how pale you are?
Do you feel hate without direction?
A kind of seed inside you that never blossoms
It is at the gallows end one forgets that everything
has to have a greater meaning
An unrecognisable call drags you towards the unspoken word
to suffer Martyrdom for the others
The Saviour cut off your wings, somehow just to remind you that He exists
Those who wait for His salt with open wounds have a way to go
the shadows of your must rest (first)
Though I ask, why do you dig your own grave when others do it for you?
The force behind the hit can not be mistaken
'cause He's the saviour with magnanimity and
...a light in the dark

Maybe it is intimidating more than lighting the way,
where is the road going? To a place where you can wash the blood of your hands?

Where did the knowing go?....With a saviour to transcendental kingdoms
or to the valley of the forgotten?
behind the vault of the sky's mystery lies a dream
damned or saved, how could we ever know?


5. Prime Evil Renaissance

He would kill the white-draped men
He would kill all holy men
He would kill the powers in control
to waste these jokers in this pathetic game
He would choke the sleaze pig
He would shepherd the sheep off the cliff
He would crush all organs of speech
to start the process of renewal
He would avenge the dead
He would crave divine protection
He would sing the songs of darkness
to call upon it to manifest
He would "mirror" himself in the tundra frost
He would rape its virtue
He would disable its ways of hurting him
to give him that advantage
This would be the way of the misanthrope
in order to create you must destroy
We would greet the nuclear morning mist
We would smile at all life dying
We would cherish each and every moment
and celebrate the return of Sin
We would bow to the planet's Iconoclast
we would march under the flag of Dominion and Hate
we would burn all conspirators
and their works with 'em
We would reveal the only truth
we would make them really sorry
we would show them Sovereignty in true fashion
and then be a reflection of their loss
We would soak up the last joys of our lives
we would Hail that grotesque destiny
we would walk on to the last glory
and hope for blessing to come


6. Supersonic Journey

A rotating silver-colored plateau, drops that dance down the columns
Blue, cold and the raging star wind
glowing colors at fearful speed
indistinct pictures of prophets and visionaries in a galactic fog

in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
inevitably he can see it, the lights are going out and he knows
if he just could make us understand
In the emptiness there is nothing that can draw the picture you want
just a stillborn child on hands that fumble
Raging, raging at incomprehensible pace
the colors blinding, the plateau falls in outer hell
They disclose that we had to die... We bit the hand that fed us

in outer space on an axis
In another reality on a supersonic journey
Is this what is yet to come, or a madman's reflection of the soul?
As when his heart cried out in pain when he perceived what
burdens we were to bear


7. End Of Journey

[Instrumental]



8. A Moment Of Clarity

Without beginning, without end (our lifeblood)
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be (to know)
blue-cold and the grim truth stands before you (all you ever wanted?)
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as a one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify


9. Down South Up North

[Instrumental]



10. The Scorn Torrent

Break down all conventional forms and create chaos to reinvent order
Rebel against all circles and dead ends
fight your way with your mind set on the masses
execute with mechanical aggression
arrogance and extravagance
march on unapproachable
shut out the outside pressure
or are you too weak?
when shall they see the real darkness?
In a world where our justice is replaced by mercy
...mercy for the inferior
The serpent's maelstrom is already here
just waiting to be unchained
so feed the fire with the vile and let sincerity rule
why can't you see that the armoured hostile aura is meant to keep you away in all your primal simplicity
(it seems like) fright procreates the downfall of the mind
such a sin isn't it... the stagnation of it all
You must collect your instruments of battle
and protect, to emancipate that which lives within you
Rebel against the chains
Break down the embodiment of your pain
Attack with robot precision
Rise and Shine under Wings of Divinity
Now pick me up night and whirlwind
and let me ride with you
to peace of mind and nothing to Rebel

1. With Ravenous Hunger

On my signal, unleash Hell

Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes

You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake

It will gradually tear you apart
It will eat you from inside
No longer sweet revenge
No longer emotional triumph
Pity you, led to believe (in own willpower)
Pity you, (resting) on withered laurels
Can't you see, the world's on fire...
Can't you feel, you're getting burnt!

There's a day coming, for me to rip and to rape
There's a winter coming, for you to be swallowed
Swallowed by emotional cold
Swallowed by a power much greater than yourself

Who made deceit into the ultimate award?
Who told you, you're not poisoned?
I see the snake coiling inside you
I see the venom in your eyes

You can't stab me, or even touch me
You can't betray me, it's just an illusion
I built the pain inside you
I spawned the snake


2. Angstridden

Born into a field of flowers, to slowly wilt away
Sheltered by wings, delicately smothered by blindness
Released among the wolves, thus molded by resistance
Ridden by the clawed hoofs of tyrants

The fruit of other worlds, but grown by loneliness
Concealing a black soul, and but sensing the beyond
Uniquely grown from within
Shimmered by a darker night, but left to solitude

How can one disclose a darker night,
If one but rests?
Or evidence the suffering,
By wordly gauge?
Or comprehend the long-drawn agony
When pain and evil never trod one down

Like a warring sun, from a better kingdom
Beautiful, free, of different steel!
Dearly prized, and equally broken
He should have gone free of you!

An emotional tumour, gnaws from inside
Of heartless, spineless treason
The darkest night now weaves its loom
Soon to release its spawn


3. Fuel For Hatred

Scornful, relentless memory
Ripped of all but drive
Undressed by betrayal
Zero tolerance for the souldead
Wish I was the violence,
Inflicted upon you

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

Little you,
Still like a claw in my eye
Pulsating organic rage
I should have let you off of the hook
Mind drifts
Into dynamic pain
Universal onslaught
I'm on my own (One soul, one hate)

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind

Damnation, holocaust
Devil horns for you to ride
Time for the angel
To spread his wings and fly
World opponent,
Wishmaster of gruesome pain
Stormtroops' frantic fury,
Demoniac spitfire!

Abortion of religious life, distinguish the rot
I hate you
To a level of intoxication
Don't feel alone,
I've got enough
I wish you slow death,
Slow death by grinding

Fuel for Hatred, air raid siren to mankind


4. Suffering The Tyrants

Crawling down the road of life
Another hopeless speech
Gruesome soul numbness
People stare, do they know
I am suffering the tyrants

Every gesture is a malicious attack
A firm fist of misery
But it shall not coincide
With the Lion's downfall

There are no tears
No feeling of guilt
Nowhere to channel the anger
Nowhere to leave the pain

How can they feast upon the Lion without knowing?
...He will eventually rise again

Hunt him down (when He is at his weakest)
Tempt him down (on His knees if you can)
Stronger than all (so it's futile)

All there is left (right now) is personal pride
Enough to return with rays of light


5. Possessed

Mourning the decay
Bitter ungodly enemy
Cast into heavy woe
Left in the corner of the world (we are possessed)

Out of the maze, with clearsight - at the brink of one's abyss
Out of the maze, with clearsight - cold eyes at the world
Out of the maze, with clearsight - disbelief and scorn
Out of the maze, with clearsight - not poisoned by your fraud (we are possessed)

The realisation of the position
No longer vulnerable
Having played the music no one could understand
Serenade to the devil's den - He, the final frontier!

Defaming judgement
Upon the starving souls
Mourning self-made pestilence
Cannon fodder for the
Apocalypse

A haunt for every unclean spirit
Lord of the flies or kingdom of death
Circle the prey, show them your eyes,
They bear witness of centuries of might

Predecessor who blessed us with grace
In sempiternal fight
Excessive aggression -
Fire is the definite sign of rebirth!

The elders' electrons channelled through you
Carried by thy night Supremacy
Born to win this battle, defeat is the tongue
Of the whore


6. Repined Bastard Nation

Do we need another bastard nation...
Another force-fed disgust
Do we need another bastard nation...
Aiming at us clinically
Like an insect-swarm
Towards the shapeless mouth
Of a dead whore
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Arising from melted mass
We need the spirit, the voice, the angel of light
Taking invincible shape
To standing ovation
Repossessing night and her hand's godly touch

The unbearable feeling of hitting that
Dark wall is a scene that must come to an end

Eartly decay in front of our eyes
Now, now it's killing for a living

No more repined bastard nation
A generous gesture to a people so blind
No more repined bastard nation
Fumbling, descending, away from the light
It takes a non-poisoned creature
To withstand a monster that has grown and spawned,
A darkness, I can not tolerate
A darkness we must bury
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain...
The search to justify one truth
Do they feel, do they absorb our pain...
The greater understanding

It takes a non-poisoned creature
To defeat and destroy a monster,
That has grown and spawned
A darkness, a darkness we can not tolerate


7. Mental Mercury

Past tense icons
Locked up in cages
A disgrace to us, (and) a vital sight of (impending) doom
Upheld by insane aggression
No tender repentance, (just) denial of ugliness
With the rain come their conquest

Behold those who ride black winds
Satan, the kings are heading home

No harmony on the horizon
When our haven burns silently
An image of absolute mutiny
Against those who pertain to the dearest hell

Monotonous graveyard plains -
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain -
A higher form of suffering!

(Why should man be protected,
What has he done to justify it?
This is why we embrace animals;
They represent the innocence man doesn't have)

Monotonous graveyard plains -
The soul exile
Quintessence of pain -
Satan, the kings are heading home


8. Black Lava

Grey heavens, no light shed
Bleak day, change is ahead
Oval mountainside, naked cold
Unreleased powers, no fright

Slide down sorrow, smell what comes with the breeze
Cold chambers, punishment awaits
Hollow tone haunts, anticipation's choir sings
Turn around, face the depth of inner sanctum

Autumn in the air, (the) smell of Black Metal 90-95
World moves, in mysterious ways
Body onwards, mind drifts
You die, then we hail (to our relief)

New age dawns
Face all wrath
Sickness; won't understand,
Burning first
Grace falls
Volcano shaking
Fates are being sealed

Heavens blunder,
No turning back
Will you or will you not
To heroism walk

Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight

Pernicious flow, redemptive perpetuity
Unholy drive, the gods arrogant grin
If my world's a joke, do you see them smile?
Hellbound me - on a throne of gold

Wastelands prey on dying cattle
Desert sucks on poor man's thirst
Glimpse of glory, walk ahead
Slaves of Nazareth, can not be fed

Black Lava, drifting down the mountainside
Black Lava, you can't fight


9. Live Through Me

[bonustrack only on LP-version]

Gods of the land remember him
For he has served the purpose
And sworn to thee

Master of the mountains
Spirit of the sea
Bringer of justness
Lord of the dark ways

Flee from him, for he is pure
As any soldier can be
Fighting a cause
Free as any wanderer

Armed with flame
Blazing force
Risen from time
Rebel's son

Remember the fallen
And what they did
Memory is how to
Understand the future

Troubled by those
Whose spirit is torn
From mind and body
Never surrender!

Destined by the elders
And by them acclaimed
Ascending from the abyss
Sunset for the Triumphator

[lyrics and music by Satyr Wongraven]


10. Existential Fear-Questions

[bonustrack only on LP-version]

The soul (when) stripped of all
Lies in the hands of what?
Inner chaos roars, nerves boil
Now, where to go...

A lifetime of slow inner death,
How torture is that?
Chocking fear, is life real?
And what is dying?

What if void is a shellshock's aftermath?
What if Eden is all poisoned fruit?
What if hell is forever pain?
What if life is a blindfold, and death is punishment?

Global puppetshow, made by hands of transcendental divinity
Blood rives cascades, could be virtual reality
World war slaughter, could be the final act
And graveyard paradise could be eternity's curtain
Who are the ones with the keys?
Will they lead us...
Life is nothing but untimely answers
To our existential fear-questions

Fear - reared its ugly head
Death - came to me on a somber morning

1. Now, Diabolical

The chase is on
Reverie dies
Stand up be counted
This world that we hold
Will never kneel
Fuck you - you can never win
You never had
Our persistence
It's an honor never bestowed upon you
We're wide - awake
All senses alert
We'll brush you off
Like dirt on our skin
A lifetime under devil wings
Has forged a shield of unpenetrable strength

'cause they want
'cause they need
'cause they are
Made to be
Now, Diabolical

Countless nights of ferocious anger
And grinding teeth
The jaw is clenched
The spark is lit
The target locked
We want you dead
Your head on our plate
You wanted war
And war you will get
You sorry man - you never knew and you (were) never prepared

We cannot
We will not
We never have been affected by you
We will always fight
We will never rest
We will not mourn

Those who got lost
We entered this world and thought nothing
Of no one or anything
This world that we hold
Came to us with our lives
You always thought
You never knew
You never grasped our existence
A shallow mind in an empty shell - no good to this world
Both feet on the ground
Firmly positioned
Our boiling blood is pumping
Damn you all for being so small
You cannot kill
What you cannot see


2. K.I.N.G

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Beholding the might
In its dawn of grace
In its beauty and light
In its pride and glory
Rushing torrent - time and space
Elder lords - crack the soil
Gone or dead - you've never been
Kingdom come - hear the roar
Climbing down to rule the earth

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Upon high places
With their heads up high
With their lives at stake
With their blades at hand
Triumph come - beyond the gate
Giants rise - from the pits
Worlds collide - chaos reign
Dawn of gold - age of gods
Climbing down to rule the earth

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Lighting strikes - wake up now
He the fourth - hate the weak
Summon all - make the signs
Legions march - earth the void

Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G


3. The Pentagram Burns

Hellbent and raw
Armed to the core
Walks with the wind
Determined and strong
Inherit his laws
Adopt and obey

[Chorus:]
Rise my friend - march to war
Time is up - shadows dance
Fight my friend - tyrants pull
Time is up - burn the world

Driven by sin
Let the scavengers loose
Power from hell
Siege and advance
Silence the foe
Fire and smoke

[Chorus]

From the slumber arise
Triumphant Beast of forgotten times
The Pentagram Burns
And the clock strikes the hour
The Final Hour


4. A New Enemy

Retreat, divide
What moved, what blurred
What spun, what changed
Our perception of reality

Awaiting the battle destined
Reflecting the ending desired
On bloodstained soil
The circles meet
Face him
On bloodstained soil
The fog dispersed
Come forth - A new enemy

Unknown, begone
It stirs, it tears
It rips, it shreds
The bizarre nature of our kind

Awaiting the battle destined
Reflecting the ending desired
On bloodstained soil
The circles meet
Face him
On bloodstained soil
The fog dispersed
Come forth - A new enemy

For what, for whom?
No rule, no sense
Awaiting the battle destined
Reflecting the ending desired
On bloodstained soil
The circles meet
Face him
On bloodstained soil
The fog dispersed
Come forth - A new enemy


5. The Rite Of Our Cross

Freedom, urge, faith - and deeper he falls
Hatred, rage, fear - the stronger denial
Anger, heat, lust - the higher he climbs

[Chorus:]
Slave - the shackles are off
Act - Do it your way
Horns - the abyss ascends
Now gather the earth
It's the coming of the Dark Lord
All tribes unite
This is the rite of our cross

Viewing, judging, killing - A formula known
Fading, paling, rotting - A story too old

[Chorus]

Wielding, might, just - Now throw me the fight
Glowing, thriving, winning - The truth will be told

[Chorus]


6. The Darkness Shall Be Eternal

They've come into this sphere
With (their) natural born fire
To spread and protect new found truth
No man is man more noble the the cause he fights (for)

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man
From the mind
From the heart
From the soul

In the day and hour of depression
Fate is on our side
The twilight is soon over
And heads are turned northwards
Behind the wall of sleep is and always was

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man
From the mind
From the heart
From the soul

The will to win and timeless strength
Holy holy union made in hell
No dark force for you to overcome

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man


7. Delirium

A bitter blow - A darkened maze
Can take you down
A fearless man - A shattered spirit
Will immerse in misery

Come see it - Come feel it
It is here
Come see it - Come feel it
It's alive

Delirium - Out of bounds
Delirium - Dying inside
Delirium - Left to wither
Delirium - Infernal Majesty

Count me in
(Let's) ride the storm
(And) fend them off
Set Me Free

A source of light - A tower call
Can lead the way
A scent of blood - A lust for life
Will take you home
A broken mind - A Fiery soul
Will stand the pain
A tightened fist - A will divine
Can break the chain

Come see it - Come feel it
It is here
Come see it - Come feel it
It's alive

Delirium - Out of bounds
Delirium - Dying inside
Delirium - Left to wither
Delirium - Infernal Majesty

Count me in
(Let's) ride the storm
(And) fend them off
Set Me Free


8. To The Mountains

I Lost Touch With me
I was And Still Am Fire
Ignite! To the Mountains

Live Breath Sense Move
I know It pains me too
Ignite! To the Mountains

Lies, deceit
Fright, escape
Caught, burdened
Gone, trapped
Get up, on your feet
Give me, your very self
It's time to Rise!

Persist Progress
Chin up
And Ignite!
To the Mountains

Cast the light - deadly trail
I see it now
Sky is lit - opens up
I want my share
Lift me up - carry me
I need you now
Heal the wounds - bloody deep
I have to stop
Ignite! To the Mountains
