PREFACE
‘We are here to finish the artwork of the earth’

Subjectivity as developed by Immanuel Kant should be the bleuprint to individualism, if Schopenhauer develops the problem of it and develops the system itself we can clearly see it developed into a paradox, that it is then turned into a crisis or everyone just repeats Kant 200 years later saying “everything is subjective” with nothing but white walls and technology hysteria as a result we can see we have a problem.
‘it is said that everything is useless by atheists and modernists, this philosophy comes in culmination with android robots, real humanoid robots, it is stated already since 1999 by members of which this manifest comes from that everything is decorative and therefore usefull? Artisan bakeries painting and sculpting will be relevant again as much as ice creams is relevant to kids.” Also people will not go to office jobs anymore, robots can just stay there if not the entire economy becomes useless, then people will need artisan ateliers locally to furbish themselves with artisan wealth, the top of the pyramid of needs will be realized to acquire in the masses, those that keep being grumpy can go kill themselves, those that wanted to kill themselves now with the very bleak and unesthetic and political bullshit prospect can be saved or revived. Also people who got run over or committed suicide deserve a second chance we live in a new world now and they need extra care now.
As of the time of publication, it is clear both ecological destruction and technological progression are deu for an exponential increase, we are at the last point before the curve reaches vertically going up. We have wrecked the ecology too far without now needing massive technological intervention, even if this will be very hard, though as children we know or speak not of death, we have the duty to stand a last stand. Robots will be mass produced in coming years, in this way the artisan, bakeries, sculpting, classical painting will be important again, and will be provided with meaning and relevance with the considerations of this manifest, also we analyze the past twohundred years for cleus of spacetravel and what is aesthetics.
We are here to denounce this end where 200 years of defaitist philosophy brought us, we no longer state an opinion as it would be futile, we see the thread of how this subject philosophy created the world as it is, then there is no more excuse to use a mere opinion to keep it going, no we are not subjects in a structure, if you are not filled, you are lost, and if you are filled with content, you need to take over.
This will help you to bring about and certify your content, When the municipality building in Praag was donned frescoes by Alphonse Mucha and in the same vein at the time the Brussels Palace of Justice was decorated by Jean Delville they had topics and a world about them, not a caricature of individualism whatever that is, this will allow any esthetics to sink back and find a content front he past looking to the present, not formulate more crisis from the present looking at the past.
i'm not talking about individual philosophies of individual philosophers i'm talking about the structure as a whole through the Kant Descartes Hegel Schopenhauer NIetzsche Becket Camus Existentialism world???????


Evolution, where it works in the material plane, like a comet to bend the evolution, and working on the biological plane, DNA strains, must also work in perception, which is where all mankinds imagination is part of evolution. It would appear in a mathematical universe, perception too is part of a gravity. Deprecative or open minded assumptions are always part of mankind's duties within the structure. Here we are then aware of ourselves and our new duty to finish the artwork of the earth, as our current parasitical phase to eat ourselves fat on the earth is over, and its time to get to work.  We see that the distopias they wrote, existentialism, the wasteland by TS Eliot, it all came treu, it is not just what there is, we have if subjectivity freezes everything the duty to dream and to keep arts fertile, the point of this manifest is to get out of subjectivity, for those that mindlessly repeated it, but also to find the people who can have more formal debate and don’t block everything in a deprecating remarks. The amateurism is staggering, everyone is painting a pretty picture without any background and the great minds are left among them squealing, there is no focal point, everything is dispersed, so revolting against them will have them look at you with wonder. Why? He can do what he wants?! Revolt is clearly over, then the ideals of revolt come to a dead end, then all we can do is dream again, but then the rationalists laugh?! This laughter is then a problem, made into a solution, of which they can not see the end. We are therefore left with our answers turned into problems by everyone. What did they protest for? TO liberate individualism which no one understood, and to create a more industrial hedonism which today has diar consequences as everyone is compartmentalized in a powerless subject again. Its not that you say everything is subjective that will liberate you now. But if you dare communicate and DO state an opinion then people will see that as an attack on their individualism?? They say you don’t let me be how i want to be for myself. But does n’t amount to anything. THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION??? To state it bluntly, the average mind is emancipated, and the deep mind is discarded and left to rot, growing ever more insane in isolation, and being dispersed, unable to find the media to find its kin. This all with an impoverishment in religion and a preferance for mindless real estate and tourism developments, but both stand on the notion that they are archology, they are not life, and you can not keep doing this?! At some point the faith goes out of it. Then you need to rebuild faith as the key component of intuition, the expression of the formal into the future. Then they will say owh idealism, owh utopias. The depression to live and reason with these people is neverending, if they understand any of it at all. But as we will repeat the structure is nevertheless expanding, at some point we need to address these things, and escape subjectivity which is possible here. If you do not then take a stand out of subjectivity, you are in advance just growing the structure anonymously and to a certain disaster.
The dialectic method, the idea to construct, is lacking in common individuals, the dialectic method of Courbet or Duchamp; a thing of which Foucault was hinting at the end of his life. The dialectic method built this entire society, in which Schopenhauer was n’t exactly right if he said everything would always be the same. Depression created depression. We need to overcome ourselves in a much more megalomaniac fashion then Nietzsche ever considered. We see the pitfalls of the progressive where if we give answers to the subjectivity crisis everyone says everyone is too narrow minded to think about these things. This is why we need to construct our own media, as again, kapital is not the crisis, actually subjectivity crisis is the main problem and main current of todays world. Kapital is only useful if the subjects know to do anything useful with it. This society looks the way it looks because it satisfies subjects because it does n’t know what a subject really wants or needs. The media and politics have to cater to every subject because nothing as a creed or an ideology to a subject is defined. Ergo, we need to say everything is subjective to agree with everyone else, whereas with that we did n’t say anything. If you speak of background people are offended, if you actually state this should be superior esthetics people say no everything is subjective, not realizing what state of mind they are creating with that. Hence the ones who saw the progressive crisis try to embrace classical esthetics and work with it as a solution to 200 years of revolt and are then considered antiquities. I state that in individualism where there is nothing to revolt against you have to BUILD opinion and support opinion and be AMAZED at originality and skill but this is not the culture? The cloaca machine and this modern art is therefore scratching open the same wounds again. People everywhere are digging themselves further into the hole. Because everyone can say that people are too narrow minded, excuse me, a banana on the wall? I think the solution to this existential crisis should be in a gallery too. I think having an art nouveau bank to purchase with esthetic artisan money some steampunk goods is ART, and it will be the only REALITY, the REST, is spacetravel then we consider. RECYCLE the money machines etc, and don’t make new fancy shit that no one needs; BALANCE THE ECOLOGY, DO NOT PROVIDE THE MASSES WITH ALL THEY NEED!! THE MASSES ARE MEANT TO MAKE THE MACHINE WORK, NOT MAKE THE MACHINE TERMINATE ITSELF??? all this subjectivity followed into a society where the rich, the media, everything sabotages itself. The masses are going everyone is narrow minded etc, but this from Elvis Presley to Black metal. This from Courbet to Bananas on the wall is not really that. thats why allll we can say is; DRAMA WILL RETURN, you can repeat that perpetually they say buy garden furniture, well, three percent of fish left, the masses are going to have to start caring at some point. THAT is the revenge of Drama?! while everyone is going THIS is ENTERTAINMENT. If Christ was an individual, he had 2000 years of churches built for them. And then now, there is individualism. And people put a banana on the wall? If you can be an individual? WHAT are you going to be? THEN THERE IS NO POINT to hang a banana on the wall, THEN ITS JUST hysteria, like all this is. BUT, there are more important things to share, but noooo, don’t publish me, noooo your an artists who does n’t get recognized until he is dead. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW STUPID THAT IS TO HEAR???




What is the presumption in Physics and Biology right now is that the deer and the lion are indifferent, but any sound mind would state that it is impossible for them to be indifferent, they are parallel. As a subject and the structure is parallel, as is a rococo chapel and religion part of evolutionary biology. As is a house of someone who says “beauty is subjective” you can see that in his house. If he would have a divine sign he would have other thoughts. So does this divine sign then not exist? Should it not actually HAVE to exist??? Otherwise what is indeed rather intelligent and resourceful, would sacrifice itself to despair it retains from having to live in its own ego. And its kindness would have to be stated, is utterly lost in a world of indifference. We would just simply have to wave it goodbye as it would n’t be part of a rational, lucid order, but our facial features are indeed highly sophisticated to allow for more artistic attributes, so why is this then? And why has n’t a solid society been built on Kant and the enlightenment? Kant as the notion that everything is an object to different subjects and the world it created  is as much dialectic as it is dialectic the necessity to review him at this point. Then when we did that you will fully have breathed in how modernism is not the truth and of which modernism makes all other realities impossible or severely impairs their emancipation, you see that it is rather a delusional attitude. And you can breathe out, and prepare for the coming Milky Way civilization, congratulations we are back at the beginning!! At that point also biologists can study rococo churches and see how a walz in there looks in stead of ogling at monkeys all day comparing us to them in every way, which does n’t add a thing to our intuitive creativity but also narrows it down, whereas our facial expressions are clearly inconceivable to analyze, as our arts is also not to be inferior towards the monkeys, maybe the biologists could evolve as well, and religion will be affirmed then as i said as part of evolution. If they study it, may they keep a cool head, its a lot more seductive then monkey instincts, especially when you compare the interconnected logic of these religions to the advent of this and newer times.
As It is Said of Schopenhauer in 1990’s philosophy books, is he in turn solipsistic, is it also just an opinion, as is said in architecture, we did n’t know but to stick forms back on? As they said in the academy of art. “Classic art is just there, we can’t say anything about it.” these things are not unrelated but very much part of the death of subjectivity.
The neurosis of describing a subject as a generality, opened the gate for progress optimism and the neurological or fixated time away from a more schizophrenic, imaginative, "conservative", balanced eternal recurrance and it exchanged it for the new, the minimal, the industrial, i mean progress would be good for space travel but what else is it good for?
The emancipation of the subject away from culture and environment produces its despaired and nihilist, minimalist and futile hedonism. Of which any formal imagination is then deemed schizophrenic and sent to psychiatry for treatment where they are powerless, except for giving pills to tranquilize the naturally upsetting dichotomy of original and sparkling facts in a society where the ordinary primes, the ordinary as an offset from the generality of the subject, having depleted the nuances of the perfume of the formal.
The psychology, the FACT of the feature of the subject prevailed over the FACT of the feature of the object.  The object disappeared and the subject run on an automatic pilot of deformalization. So all in our mind is an illusion, and the reality of the outside world evaporated, why then did it evaporate? Not because we still communicated somehow? And how can Kant and Schopenhauer be right then? Where is Colin WIldsons man of power, when he sees the streets today? To a new innovation of culture? The aristocrats sure were revered and built castles, now they build but the hive. And as much as the ONLY philosophy today is archeology, there is nothing TO believe but archeology, which is a paradox, and can’t be maintained. So it is that the belief in archeology and the lack of formal conversation keeps the industrial engine alive with all its provision and nihilist consumption. We are heading for what is known then as a biological overshoot, where an organism found much resources and grows out of bounds, soon to crash. In a modernist stance the structure is expanding, in an arch symbolist stance we need to redraw from nature and invest in space travel SOME time?! Sooner rather then later.
This premise on the wrong interpretation out of Kant of the Hegelian linearity of thesis and antithesis while the schizophrenia of the classics and unspoilt of childish magickal thinking is presupposed to be deconstructed in the in this also presupposed emancipation of the subject at the expense of the arts.
In the fact of the object the subject can be hypothetical and in it it finds its natural balance of discourse, and does n’t have to be polarizing but argumentative and formal, yes in the formal expression of the subject the object grows. In the formal expression, in sentiments taken seriously and being treated generously, even embraced, is the treu function of a mind and a soul. In it you can write a book for which people today classify someone with a word and give him or her a pill and be rid of it.



If we are not going to talk about the weight of the structure and how it expands and the texture on that weight of the structure then we are just being sucked up by that structure, and this truth you would find regardless amounts to little or nothing and will not be part of progress, yes considering this is widely ignored by reasonable amateurs it is in great doubt if progress is possible at all.

If it was the most beautiful philosophy it would create the most beautiful art with the most practical results for the ecology, generosity, spirituality and altruism
 NOT the most debilitating positivist philosophy to create minimalist concepts with the most devestating results for ecology, please not subjectivity, ego, money, commercialism and the market. 
THis would in turn be done merely by shifting the pejoratives to esthetics and faith etc and spirituality to the melioratives in such a way argumentatively framed that it is completely in line with science but still ART would be possible  This should then become a resurgence of esthetics and ethics, to be know loyalty empathy chivalry etc etc if at all i thought there was still time or anyone would understand this manifest and the complementing mythology?? The time for Kant or Schopenhauer publishing is over thats just for the academics now and because wellll, they had an influence, if you doubt them and see streams of errors no doubt you are not classic nor modern, and that is our problem here???


At some point we can only see that where we state “beauty is only subjective” is a tragic identification with all other things, and at some point you will have to SEE the world that that infinitely repeated notion created, at some point you will have to see by the sheer abundant evidence of mankind as a social being that that beauty that you value needs to be accepted by someone else, and you need to value the beauty that someone else is so keen to have accepted by you. This distance, this solipsistic pit of our age needs to be overcome. And see the structure, that the skyscrapers and the homes are not just objective. They are harboring all these lonely sad souls, spitting from their encapsulation in claustrophobia, who have effectively detached from the color of fantasy which is nature.
The time is right on which the Schopenhauer notion that we are just mold and our situation is diar, which took everyone hostage, is discarded, where a working mechanism wirklichtkeit or werkelijkheid as a term for reality is so much better as a word it is also true for philosophies which grow an importance and then are depleted of life. To seek refuge in art leaves very little of art, to believe in it actually makes one combatant against society, no longer does the nihilism of society press its weight on us, no, actually we perceive the weight of sustaining subjects as detriment and can have ambition for a weight to transform into a balanced reality. No longer do we live in an alien world with alien values.
We only delve then, with the end result to find our senses and our words again, into the paradox that, if everything is subjective how can there be any dogmatic esthetics, except subjectivity itself now, again, which depletes the romantic beauty, the victorian elegance, the art nouveau sensuality, the appealing or any roman or gothic notion. From this esthetics we then come to ethics as everyone is currently doing what they want and launching an assault on dogma’s anyway. THats what stands out, the disdainful attitude of the averages still defended not withstanding; but which should be entirely sacrificed to the decorative and to content again in this revolution.

To find people who have the intelligence and dilligence, to regard the following problem. That the world is more important then the spatula to bake your potatoes for dinner later.
For that people would move mountains, for art and ecology, the whole world, the future, which was in ignorance destroyed and discarded for 200 years, for that, nothing, it is their crisis that they would laugh and smirk and make jokes to defy any interest in saving the world. Thats why we want every Spartan, Every Greek, Every ROman, Every elf, Every death emo or death elf, in regalia, fully mobilized, arms drawn!!!

Let me do a psychological test with you if this manifest is for you.
These are actual conversations in a despair to find a living human being to fight this decay.
If you can figure whats wrong with the answers, which means, if you get to disgust the answers, you are a soldier for our cause.
THE SPATULA ALLEGORY
So they would shop for a spatula at the other side of the earth within one hour, and it would take these people four months to get a card to pay for a site to save the earth. If thats what it SAYS thats probably what it WANTS to do? I mean if you say you will cook a potato thats probably what it WANTS to do.
So yeah the answer 
“i eat my potatoes with a fork.”
this is uninspired, irony to excuse yourself, not very well done as it makes no sense at all.
ANYWAY
the next ones i’m not going to comment on them. You will instantly see what is wrong with this world. And join us, there is no excuse.
THE DISHES ALLEGORY
your preoccupations in a concentration camp for dishes, because you have lost religion and you desperatly cling on the last vestige of what you can suppress others to do. I will like to put my dishes all next to a tree and stack ‘m in columns in a forest before i commit to your stupidity.
“The tree won’t do your dishes”
If you can see whats wrong with that answer, by all means read on.
THE CLOSET ALLEGORY
A person does n’t need a closet if it means the death of the world.
“you need a closet.”
if you can see whats wrong with that answer, again, you will be disgusted and ready for duties.
If you say seven billion mouths will soon be chasing the last sardine. They say “i’m not a sardine”.

Then when the media proposes as is natural to them and their discourse, yes has the audacity for someone interviewed to claim “i can’t enjoy classical music, the snobbism is disturbing.” And we in our turn were on our own discourse confronted when saying “there is too many soccer fields in Victorian parks” that we were a snob. On the contrary. If you can’t enjoy a sports game or even your food because of the vulgarity, backwardness, stupidity and ugliness of modern reality, let alone its hypocrisy and its whole civil attitude at the brink of the abyss.
Then you are with us.
That it needs to patronize on little things, in the prospect of total demise when exactly thinking so little and small is the problem for the total demise. That is our problem.
If you want a philosophy and delight to give you peace, and tranquility, and that all is over and done.
Then the world is your oyster.
If you want a philosophy to make you restless, creative and militant again.
And to make you choke and vomit from and on this world.
if you want to transform your mental demons of psychosis into a very emotional nausea which could then be put into the violence of the world where you can aim your target again.
Then this manifest is for you.

If there is a level of balance and contingency, in society, and all these paddle courts are really spaceships to Mars and Moon, then if I said “share my message” for 15 years already. Means responsibility is the people who DID NT share my message have the gist to recycle all that with their bear hands, in stead of saying, its already happening, we doing what we can. They will see it when its too late, Stupidity is so often THE SAME as ill will. Because there is a hypocrisy involved to CHOOSE the most dumb and easy route. If we were SMART you would choose an ever further but more agreeable and rewarding route. Maybe even just for a dream, something illusive, but if that made you suffer, and the result would be beautiful. Then that is certainly beauty and pride and honour, and justice, and of that, the dove in stead of the fecal matter, is of what we speak here. Martyrdom over dishes, fiction over reality. Or reality over this dumb fiction every household bat is stating we should stick to.
It is that audacity for the masses when they have left or smothered any pride, honour or justice in the era without actuality, with surpassed creeds, where they enjoy their food and household and tourism, and that the decadence of the symbolists and the hedonism and the description of life as it is is in itself a deficit and it is terribly hard to find the answer to that, of course naturalism, the simple description of ordinary life in the 1880’s before the decadents arose with their taste in dreams was tedious, what these people have done to the modern world, for that there is no excuse.



It is in the gist and the attitude from now on that artists we work in the spirit of a stone to want to become a church, and for the dumb it is necessary to understand art through mathematical as deeply disturbing projections that this is in fact true, and until that day that it is proven, we are feeling eternal disillusion, loneliness, and destitute, and detached, but light is stone, and stone is part of an illusion. therefore we weep as we know this knowledge to be treu. We shiver, as Spinoza said when a stone could think it would consider gravity its will, now it actually see to lay there, and loves poets prophecies as WELL, they are interconnected, parallel as i said, and magick. This does n’t rhime with what is left of spirituality today, some hobby the positivist society scorns, smug with their suit and tie, gutting the earth further. What we need to do is make a science of what we lost, get it back and construct a vision of beauty for the future.

To measure people, to be so careful with them as they would be cattle, you only confirm death with that. With every second, which with every second you live is confirmed, rather then be occupied in life, which in all circumstances awaits that life a sure Heaven. Again we only talk here of the excrements or the flight of the dove. The simple means to live if one could only discard this negative notion inherited from the enlightenment would lead to heaven yes, a life under science will start, resume its entire course, and end, and be perpetually more after the end, the gutter of all life, vision, art and beauty, analysis done in the wrong way leaves a gutter of an inheritance, as we are the destitute children, orphans of spirituality today.



In modern architecture there is the disdainfull remark, “we did n’t know any better then to stick forms back on?!” this is no culture, but indeed after twohundred years it is stuck. This resonates in philosophy reviews noting “Is perhaps Schopenhauers solipsism also subjective?!” well the consequence that indeed you realize it does, will not have you walk out with a clear mind instantly, after twenty years of having faced that consequence I have written myself out of it and we now need to propose a dramatic new turn, a turn which is as megalomaniac as this world with its seven billion got itself all stuck, as media and any other compartmentalization of culture, art etc, is all equally stuck. In that people are not educated will see in this world nothing passed or future, they will just sit there scratching their backsides, the enormous volume, corruption, ecologic disturbance will be an idle understanding to them. Equally so that no one forms a profound analysis and it is up to these subjects to respond makes also these instigators of the actual ecologic apocalyps arrogant or rather nihilistic. Its no use when its your personal opinion, but what if this was the only thing that needed to be generalized, analysed. To satisfy your own opinion will generalize to the larger whole, to deny the opinion you would need to actually have a cultured, spiritual, formal reply, and that is exactly what we need to do here.
The paramount issue of language is that spirituality, and or beauty, and or religion is held up to society above anything. Otherwise all is doomed under the nominator of normal, reality, the structure, but myth is a human like concept, when language does not attribute value to myth and allegory and fiction for that matter, even if fiction is a degenerate myth, then, again, beauty and the beautiful will only exist for the select few, to underscore a wide meaning to beauty and the beginning of a church above the state of ecology and spirituality is what we need to do here. We will then hear say “owh no give it to me for my cars your money, give it to me for fishing, buy some french fries, give it to your kid in stead, etc etc, this is all the structure expanding, there is no hope in that regard, no bank will pay for art or ecology no, the artisan which relieves the spirit and heals ecology, and ecology to be worked with, no bank will pay for it, however we are utterly endowed with a line credited to Guy Mcpherson “If you think economy is more important then ecology try counting your money while holding your breath.” These peoples reality is no longer a reality, they are religious, they are aliens for the same reason. And religious are often aliens indeed. But we can not simply state owh i redraw myself, this is what the majority is doing DEU to subject theory?! We need to change the theory not walk away, that this is so tiresome, to find ones kin among these jokers and babblers all around; well, i’m hoping to find some Spartans soon then the joke will be over soon as well. If we read the anhtology of black humor and we are terribly sensitive its not easy to take yourself seriously and you would bid an open word to debate to people and then hear nothing but debilitating jokes as a reply maybe we can’t take ourselves so seriously as we should sometimes. We can claim anything can become a religion then, even solipsism, even its exponents going even further into the abyss, denial, denial of all, then we wonder, what is the desirable outcome? Would we not believe in whatever deity that an artist believes in produces him and society the best art? Why would we believe anything else? Why would any other belief be of any worth or truth at all??? If there is then individuality it would be keen to be unglued of all these presumptions of modern era, that are in its civil modality, normality, reality, and indicated and vindicated in its advertisement, media, and not something you would think does not affect you. If you joke and say the world does not concern me then you are very much unlike any societal builder or someone to partake in society in the past. You are very much a modern person, you wonder if all this social media is really necessary at all with modern people who are not engaged or who provide not the slightest depth to any moral, philosophical, artistic, ecologic or esthetic view point whatsoever, Then all becomes lost in that, the hierarchy has vanished, which can not at all produce the desirable outcome. Past artists were engaged to revolt, now we reached imbecility debate absolute. This is the very power to revolt against now. then i can be here with myths and manifests and owh my are n’t you weird?? We then would begin to describe with an opinion unlike objective opinions today and see, that archeology for instance, where it does not allow or rather constrains anything else is a very religious and dogmatic act. Its amenities to be known; conceptual art, modern architecture, the “new” etc, progress optimism, psychiatry, individuality are all sick in the same basket. If you hold a sword or any artwork in a glass box, you are not just formulating an objective opinion and holding it to a pluralist crowd, you are stifling the object and the crowd. To give pills to creative minds and provide them with chemical castration in stead of this system and some humanities students in baroque clothing is in fact criminal, and this whole age is in fact criminal. Criminally insane!! NORMALITY!? …is CRIMINALLY INSANE!
To build a medieval building, an artisan clock, anything of value, from now on you always need the colors concept and kitsch, or it will be technical, cheap, without value, as far as the concept is concerned, which is definitely not new anymore but simply aformal or solipsistic, on the other hand it will be deemed as beauty, natural, artisan, and without value. These colors are colors in which the fractal of reality falls apart and of which applies, from the smallest artisan societies, to artisan arts, fireplaces, castles and steampunk  in space, arts in space or regressive arts underground. Technology and industry rendered all products vacuous. A lack of solid spirituality left all nature stale and damp. This world is hopelessly stuck in both these colors, polarizing or inauthenticity, civil stupidity cackling about values that are long surpassed. Churches and spirituality by that, are bound by nature and artisan expression, there is no value in a plastic cross, an industrial pentagram, or electrical light in a church or for that matter in a museum where those arts were never looked at like that in their own time. Atmosphere is more then just something you can buy. It is something of an entire faith and ritual to it!! In that we believe beauty, resist garbage, sacrifice this modern subjectivity which everyone is trapped in and debilitates everything with, and we resume ecology and a use for technology in Space Travel. Which is the ambition of so much arts and music and underground vision. The main discourse is a disease, we can analyze the underground rather for some solid truths and considerations. These boyish stars and other cocky tattle tails can be without our attention. We have found out internation, our publisher, our media.

The general notion of underground is working on ACTUAL individuality, fantasy, counter culture, ancient churches, ruins, to some extent it stretches to all who participate in the Halloween events. It is a culture like traditional romanticism, and wants to blast through civil mediocrity on top. In that it is a tradition and not a subculture. We are all subjects and gothic is a subculture… right?! There are thousands on the more profound dungeon synth sentimentalities, tens of thousands on again hundred thousands of albums and tens of thousands of bands, millions on some of the most famous black metal bands, millions on martial industrial and some folk, up to 200 million on Muse Uprising and 400 million on Slipknot, one billion on Billie Eilish, this is not a subculture when everything is hopelessly stuck in chewing more dead songs and dead cultures dead morals and dead vows, dead piety and dead esthetics and industrial and protestant and other religious deadness and the death of paganism and imagination of any more worth all together. You don’t refute the two hundred years of culture in here saying its like the two hundred years of culture before, and you DON'T repeat the fifty years of culture of the past stacking it on top the past fifty years it IS IMPOSSIBLE, as we will see here!!



THE LIGHTNING ROD
“...That he has the shells before your eyes fall off; discarding this previous dogma...”
Schopenhauer on Kant.
Did it not strike as absurd to anyone that In this world of 8 billion powerless individuals and their dystopian prophets not one Christ or utopist or idealogue arose? And everyone is feeling bleak, and scoff and piss on reality, while saying everyone should stick to reality? An individual here to idealize and give some direction and insight in beauty and ecology would be a dissonant, he would be an individual, and in that individualism today is a problem. It was never invented, if anything, this subject theory made everything more sterile and had everyone speak of a generality that disemboweled beauty, grew hysterical, and is trying to calm itself with more garbage. That that as eight billion people go, is futile and life is futile, will not solve matters, superficial spirituality without addressing the enlightenment and Kant and Schopenhauer will not work either. Which is why we wrote this. 

TS Eliot wrote the wasteland, Camus wrote an existential crisis, Descartes wrote a floor plan of individualism but certainly not individualism. Orwell wrote our dystopia, and all in chronological order if ever we zoom out of the past 200 years these prophets got worse and left ever fewer of reality, and that is reality, we would be surprised that this is our reality??  it is clear that the next brilliant move can’t be much of a subject notion, it is clear we might succeed in writing the next box office dystopia, but solving matters it will not do. We instill here the idea it is time that all the cultures we dress like on halloween should now be believed day in and out, and be projected into architecture, apart from an earthing move of that artisan direction, of which most technology and industry could ascend into space. That you offer any subjective take on that is at your own merit, if you want to be a footnote and to be completely useless then by all means refrain from help and aiding into this project, and loiter, and stack the world with some more of your garbage, i appeal, mostly to maidens anyway, to stack them in decorative designs. This entirely in avant garde spirit, like, i don’t know what else to do??? What else am i to say? “i Join your reality there is nothing lets just sit and stare and munch burgers??” The avant gardists have effectively succeed in the bankruptcy of the bourgeois, they have no real value or wealth left, of course this only for someone who still understands the thread of thought for some time???
I provide here an earth shattering knowledge, if you are on in the camp of awh well done, lets go to the order of the day, you are in the wrong camp, you are on the wrong side of history, you are effectively among the surpassed, brainless, desensitized side, this is a breach for awareness and meaning against commerce and futility. It will split the artisan and convert it back to nature, and will lift up all the technology and industry for good into the colonization of space, in that a balance is found and there is a readressment of classical culture for meaning, and a meaning is found in technology, where currently people would state that technology and science makes our lives useless, and that we are just bacteria or fungi, this can’t be maintained. Never does one acquire more and refute all with the concept that there is less. None the less people are sheeple to their wise, then when a new chord is struck we can only see them get hysterical, or to look away, “yes, i know this moment happened before, when i was told something i believe now, christendom or science,  i resisted, now in the annunciation of a new truth i resist again for dogma of what I believe now.” “And when i rejected it violently, whereas its a truth I behold now and i reject for violently right now.” Whereas this whole world now says provide me with leisure and retirement, the balance scientifically established here will see this problematic, like Huysmans said “the death to be repaid to defer on suffering will be enormous, we merely postpone our duties, and in this the civil reality will come to a dramatic end as i describe here. That then the only physical exponents of a system of causal studies which is technology, which all science is, would make way of a society without art or God is simply untrue, it would be true if mankind, over all it has done, has not simply done and effectively been the OPPOSITE. An INSPIRED creature, i refrain to say wise, some have however tried to research matter and mind, a lot have made errors, and even more have made religions with social lack of taste, prowess, diligence and simply were n’t very honorable, that this all should n’t be studied again or the flatulence of it all and of present society should n’t be studied, or the bill should n’t be offered to the proper people is cowardice and will eat you up. It will have you not able to look into the mirror. So far the only reason why people can look themselves in the mirror, is because they have the sheeps vanity of not being responsible, that someone else is responsible, that its all just in their own head, that there is nothing, so profits is what makes the world go round. Making the masses into a machine to produce crap and sell it to them and get rich off that? That is the truth to them? That is responsibility? That is WEALTH??? If you own the world, you own nothing until you have people a leadership to make it the least bit pretty again, and that is embedded in nature for us to do. Anything else will have us as meek disillusioned sheep. That we were meek disillusioned sheep is because we put the wrong accents, and saddened walked on in the abyss of dialectics with a bad understanding of what that is and discarding esthetic and spiritual value, when you understand this manifest it will be very clear that esthetics and spiritual value may live in nature and effectively are at the core of mankind. in that sense, rejecting this manifest is at your own peril, you would think all esthetics and ecology is a thing of the past, and mankind can now retire in his Status Quo, to forget the esteem rather then the effect of your artists and intelligence is effectively what people do, then they have this zombie smile like, “hey, we all have our opinion now man” but we could n’t applaud the death of that of the spirit more so, we could not resent it more, wish not the demise of modern society, and the strangulation of a present and coming technology more so for the now naked bourgeois, keeping this enormous infatuated attitude. Clearly, as it respects what is tattling and twatting above, and spits on every value or provocation. We will win. No matter what the outcome. We will always be more distinguished, we earn things, even in the gutter, they are unworthy of things. No matter of how many millions or fame entitlement you give them.

In the decay and death of modernism and postmodernist deconstructivism the subjectitity, analytics and archeology  itself is deconstructed, subjectified, analysed and archeologized and now all cultures art formalities CAN, ARE, AND HAVE to be considered again. This SHOULD and WILL go further then the puritanism obscenity of mass uniformity, conformism and consumption. When modern “pseudo” religions are considered and the whole decapacitated ritual and religion of conceptual art we can see the avant garde in stead of having succeeded it has failed and created a monster, well a monstrous religion to be exact, the bourgeois is as yet not irradicated, it is now, naked, literally, when considering its houses, and its plebeian attitude everywhere which spouts up and almost no one can resist, now daily chores have become the new spirituality, and all people who have visions need to be educated. When Nietzsche's perpetual return is established as a scientific fact, which it is, as it is when Death does not exist, and you would instantly be transferred in an infinity of time to a moment where a universe exists where you exist again, BY DEFINITION of infinity to exist that is true, so this can not be allowed to be so deplorable. Because against that light. God, and ANYTHING you would attribute to him. Is trivial, and why he would create a whole universe and leave us with this, the problem of that or any non man central or atheist therefore aperceptual  idea should be dismissed. As clearly it came from Schopenhauer and his problem was particularly heinous, there WAS no proof, but the religion of troll culture was bound to lose in evolution. I always started from a point that mathematics is poetry, of course with the functionality and minimalism and conceptualism now becoming useless you would PRAY against nothingness for a truth or a shred of beauty, but now with THIS and this whole manifest because of a white dove came to me, which i took in, and changed to the classical, i believe i have turned poetry into mathematics. WHY do we have to live here then we consider?? WHY should we not have art? WHY not to believe in the senses and then in stead commit to a dead alive, zombie structure. WHY is this subjectivity prevalent NOW in THIS time? This would seem absurd, but a significant crisis grown out of a significant and very tricky philosophical problem. Which we need to adress and would provide someone with solace.
If you ever seen a child grow up, it is noted that learning is infinitely hard and infinitely slow, certainly in culture we did n’t have it easy, and we were reaching into the dark. Problem is, people have deferred their responsibility, and are sick to their stomach of reality, this child itself has a disease, which was entirely a philosophical problem which induced it. An architectural, artistic problem, a problem of perception. There is beauty in learning, a child can move us, which is why this species, being so disgruntled, so dismayed, needs to be cured, that this is offered again in rancor, has to do with how dogmatic and unwittingly people just repeat the same, and shit on any meaning without further thought. Its tiresome.











“Frail child, you are not ready to let go of the present, and with that will I know it is my sadistic pleasure, my vision the future, and my only fulfillment, the resentment of mass culture, to see you suffer more, when the present is taken from you violently. No longer be you in the great complacency, and the entertainment feelings of apocalypse, of which you do not dare to presume the dread thereof.”


This manifest and everything I do is dedicated to the first readers and their rhetorical beauty. You who read Hesiod, Homer, Dante, Cervantez, Milton, Swift, Byron, Caroll, Sade, Schopenhauer, Lautreamont, Holderlin, Huysmans, Breton, and ended in Foucault, maybe Meandering in some Suskind. And in which realms of these readers I mean to stay and repose, and on which religion of literacy I mean to build, and which affiliates I mean to find in this modern hysteria.
Where is a van Gogh or a Rosetti in this heap of endless babbles?





Letter to Ephrenchey; the head monk of one of the castles of Lhy.


Its a diar state of affairs if you already established in 2004 that Immanuel Kant built the structure
then the semiotics teacher goes “owh we won't be able to deny that easily.”
i state “the structure is in balance, only you waste space technology with all this consumption”
and what do i see over the past ten years? Spaceships built on train stations in gent, Leuven, Brugge, Sint Niklaas, Mechelen, etc
They are biospheres
but owh no, much vanity and belittling, excuses and ironic mocking, expounding arguments in the wrong direction, in my own direction
books need to get published?
owh emm what?
now i see a couple of days ago the midlands US does n't want to send electricity to the coasts
its a bureacratic impossibility
they have the wind and solar capability
the coasts don't have energy.
So
I composed a capital for the US 12 years ago
now they are stuck
as i'm saying this structure is stuck
its checkmated??????
But how long do i have to walk around with thousands of ideas to fix all this
Psychiatrists will tell me “you won't get anywhere with it?”
But this society will not get anywhere WITHOUT it??????

well i'm working on my own media and money and designs
sculptures, capitals, courts, new chess game with 220 pieces per player.
amnherhea new US dollar bill will be ready next week
my community and encyclopaedia will be ready in a couple of months
if i just have some peace for a couple of months
then i'm all set to succeed.

i just had a therapist of Closed ward tell me i said i would trash all sinks and build a white bridge with the shards
i don't even write things down.
I'm saying them every five seconds one such idea?????
And you just say owh your paranoid????
thats not fair sir
but anyway.
I'm doing all i can.
Whatever else is going on does n't amount to a manuscript if it was pried from my carcass and turned into toilet paper for a politician.

sincerely

Manifestation in time and esthetics.
In every sense you will craft the allegory as it twists and turns.
You do not have to craft the allegory untill you twist and turn.
But without allegory you will twist and turn.
For allegory is all and beyond what exists.


Dispite the word crisis and current numbing existentialism without any chance for a word of the heart we may conclude before all.

“Physiology is the philosophical inquiry into the details of the generalities of the logic of matter;
to be known
in its highest manifestations the logic of art, where it concerns all weight of matter mankind produces
or
the logic of beauty, where it concerns the expressions and coinciding of form and texture, expression and form of art mankind produces,
or the logic (or intricacies for the atheist) of religion, whereas it concerns the depictions of human or other allegoric deities apart of form and at the root of form.
PHYSIOLOGY It might be called the logic of the allure or the allureology, to differ it from science, it is by all means the study of the spiritual of perception, or the identification of the very skin of reality as we will find described here. The skin of reality where it is perceived, reality as the body the solid world as an art object to mankind. We are not talking any longer of the world as subjective to us, we are talking about subjectivity in its modern convention, subjectivity AS culture, subjectivity as a whole and all consuming culture, and the resulting material exponents in its art and daily life, urban development, the way it handles art, the conceptualization and archologization of this time. The skin of reality equates here to actual reality as the female identifying as female, but now we incorporate subjectivity as the cube and container building species it creates which surely can’t tolerate a subject under it thinking differently?? In essence dialectics itself needs a new dialectic move to survive. We say synthesis worked to thesis and antithesis. We say the will and perception is the first stage of reality, but surely not the last, we say the dialectics of power is futile, merely to create with power is virtuous, who cares for all these laws and leaders, if not there were a building pristine to house them, and then their laws and leadership would mean very little without it as usually these days thats their merit, babbling civilians all of them... We are not for or against them but that they can babble from their chairs as much as general people, in this futile content, this clumsy reasoning without history has led us to this diar ending. There have been those known to be just in their pride, and proud of their justice, or no history is at all possible, the errors of men and his modern day crimes still meander in modern humans, knights for glory actually existed and their paintings should be risen to destroy this debile economy without any notion of religion to it whatsoever. Not in classical men or women has any sense that is old and worn as the lands pervaded, as we will say more often here, time in culture does not exist. And no classical men will tolerate this enormous heap of turds and have others say, how good is it to swim in this all. He does not accept that. And what else would he do then have the turds all worked into proper manure by the peasants, and the pit dug out for a cave for him, and the boulders from the pit as stones for a temple to his findings?! More then that men does not do!!”
Would not a noble man call upon all noble people, and wash this society away? He does not Meander further in hypothetical dwellings likewise merely to drive us insane as we construct merely on the defaitism that time gave us, and that time is to be overcome like ourselves, or it shall all simply die?! And then the universe, even God would die with us, whomever you might hold as the greatest!!
ALAS Arcadia, can not poets and wise withdraw, well then. Should we be called perhaps, when mankind is testing its teeth on stone when it has no fish or tree nor food for his cattle left of the earth.
“We define all material goods, large and small, to be art. Hence subject to scrutiny and the urgence of care and a philosophy of produce in them. A philosophy in which they are produced, which can be fit to judge as a rightfull or wrongfully devised philosophy. This is not just essential, it is the very merit of wonder and how everything, even conceptual can find in us provoking greatest curiosity, but simply it is the proper use of organizing resources on the long term. To be modest with what one has and consider nothing as necessary but as considered so by societal convention. To have a closet otherwise said, is not a human right, especially not if that closet means the earth needs to be consumed for it. There would n’t be currently any human right if people did n’t make profit from those, and the profit even from that was deemed interesting due to a combination of christian theory and subject theory.”
“Let it be known that it is not forbidden on any moral ground to assess the image as it is depicted, nor even to assess anything out of the ordinary or be prohibited from any criminal compulsion in writing.”
“It is esteemed that a briljant mind does n’t have to take himself seriously. And esteemed and expected always as such of another mind that he would not have taken him seriously. As ones wisdom is ones own. Especially ones wisdom, this can not be said of naivity or even dialectics of which hordes of believers always clutter together and of which systems degenerate, also their wisdom can tend to degenerate, it is wisdom to see the degeneration of philosophical systems. Especially those of knowledge of present day, in its very nature wisdom should be more timid, universal, and apt for an allegoric depiction or exaltation in art or music of any classical or newer expression alike.”
There is the derogative regard of reality.
A dove “may shit” or “be gathered from a random egg”
There is the world simply as it is.
a dove “may be a dove”, which says nothing. It would just be, clearly morally it can not just be as we think, we form the image with reason, we add to it, so plenty must demean it…
And there is the esthetic ideal.
And a dove may be a fluttering high in these heavens a marvel.
These are the positions you can choose from, likely they are all worhwhile allegories, to have a whole culture to talk about nothing then that a dove shits seems a tad too dubious in why that would be. Something has become a religion again. Then when you talk to them, they will constantly go doves are skyrats, then you are left with refuting them again, but at no point will anyone today divert into an elegant consideration. 
This thread remains valid no matter how you look at it, the spiritual is always the decorative crown, the root in stead of the flower, or the fleeting above, the most elegant. So that exists. The occult is the angryness in the dirt and filth. The spiritual, christian sentiment is the generosity from above, Satan the malign in absence of generosity or spirituality and the refuge for the atheist as a deity of materialism.
People, which are reduced to pleb all together, and certainly against various peoples esteem, call a throne a toilet and a toilet a throne. Not just for conviction, there are threads who led to them. As i got caught in it myself, it is no secret I would like to find those underground who have ventured in the depths with me, and who have as yet tried to get out. For which i can humbly, not hindered by my arrogance speaking to most hostile surrounds, but perhaps then, offer my writings, humble to those i would write with shaking hands for, pressing my swan feather to its limits, scratching and wasting my paper time and time again.
For you have treated upon others with vulgarity, and if that would have been a convention, that surely the minute, miniscule treasure of an art aimed to heaven. Is its own immortal bliss and salvation.
This world was all that could create awareness, it created you. If there would be a better world it would not be you, and if it would be a better world it would not have a dove, wings, and seer in the heavens above you. Therefore you exist simply with the despair and the beneficial and esthetic alike.
This is our reality, welcome to it.





There could be a moral highground in saying there is so much evil, that you could consider "maybe i'm just insane." Untill then that. If we denounce beauty because it is subjective there will not be beauty anymore, if we denounce ideals and composition we will not have a world anymore and just eat it up, we will not be able to compose things but just furbish subjects, this whole notion has become its own cult, and to greater detriment of beauty and composition, it is constituted in every bit of our modern expressions and pejoratives, in its existentialism and its devoid lemma to “believe in yourself”. Then when we see the individuals efforts we see existentialism proposed as individualism. What we have been offered over the course of 200 years is a white sheet. But if suddenly you will fill it with substance then they go “owh no that is insane” “owh you are against our society” they keep cackling about everything being subjective like their life depended on it, they are void entities. And we are in the middle of them. But providing for subjects who say everything is subjective and this subject machine, in turn, providing for subjects, is cluttering up a whole earth. WHAT is composition. WHAT is balance on this earth. Therefore we must establish the ground roots of desirable composition as a science in philosophy as much as subjectivity was once considered the course of philosophy in science and created the culture of today. Which will be very hard as we lost any formal language and relation to the formal. Therefore we must first deduce or rather analyze the society of this "subjective" theory and consider what it really did. So that we can find a legitimacy in what we want to readress, and it not being part of this whole “theory of the subject." In any case, to always tell your child that beauty is subjective, is not having been communicative, not having been generous to communicate… (We have lost generosity and kindness in our convictions somewhat, part of a breach of the mathematical and the scientific with the principled and honorable in the same way. As if principles and honor could not be stowed in scientific scopes.) The child will never know what you found beautiful and then can not make out what he finds beautifuL At the root there is what leaves very little people communicate any advise to anyone, yes, communication is lost all together as all is infinitely for oneself to address, and it leaves very little to address then after all that even still?! This paradox is at the root of the objective, the scientific, and what we could not juxtapose ;the subjective, the completely intuitive, artistic, and sensation, even so in the minds eye there is science, whereas imagination is completely skewed, for it is disease, it can not logically exist?! That God does or does not exist could be left to each their discretion then? But surely what is deistic in God and religion is serenity in the imagination?! I mean we do not have to believe in toons or such but seriously. The matter in modernism has fallen to a whole irony, a whole despaired hysteria. In that science and the object falls back into the sensational, and so we see this age not as an age for each a subject but a sensational age with very common sensational ideas. Of which we mean here to investigate, but this paradox, is at the very outer end of science and religion, to call it imagination is simply a more pluralistic word, and a pluralistic world that comes with it, but what then is religion, a dignity and a bounded in delicate beauty, a ecstasy in this imagination, in any case most art as it was composed up until art nouveau. A delight. We could develop God from these words. Gods preferably then considered all in the imagination are quite equal. Alas. Perhaps with the novel notion of Gods on earth, Angels, evolution nonetheless. An ongoing venture into horror and darkness and vampirism then from the romantics and symbolists, of whom venture way underneath the masses for any to pick up on it these days. This has halted the religious expression or the expression of the position of our current imagination within artisan craft or beauty to a grinding halt, on art, there is a complete stop. Basically because of the dogma of the subjective, the dogma on the innovative and the new. If such an age would arrive it would be called solipsistic and not at all new in itself. Solipsistic as in “a closed individual anonymity and amorph ideal” Its “just” a story, its “just” music, its “just” lyrics is what we hear everywhere. We are endowed in the deconstruction, we are swimming against the tides of the pessimists, the currents they created. And with a lack of militancy they will then be responsible for the death of the earth. Idealism always consumes. Pessimism today should only be aimed at those to say to “stick to the economic reality” for they are the truly corrupt, and pessimists who are “just” subjects oblivious to the various ideologies of resistance are equally corrupt. This is a manifest to see the thread of nihilism in society. That it is effectively an ideology. To surrender to defaitism is an ideology. As Sade says, to be oneself is mandatory. But what they took away from people today. Is the militance of BOTH the individual and the collective. The structure, the hive, for the powerless subjects. There is an end looming. There is the responsability to avert the end, this can only be done, not in polarizing the “reality” they offer, but in setting up a whole new philosophical system and beginning to a material measure where there is something solid rather then the vacuous air we breathe now. And this swarm of deconstructive philosophy everyone was led to sink in. For many things there can be a misanthropic polarity between people who like art and people who like people. But modern media shows the cauldron of hysteria from democratic media, where the vile primes, and the many ails are always excused by a miniscule benefit, where a miniscule benefit always has to come as the final point to all the many detriments, keeping the hope alive. Have you not seen it? For one an article about the 700 dead plains in the oceans, and a shoulder rubbing about how we have less ships crashing into each other, treu story. This is the media with all its advertising in a nutshell, clean your own room, get the filth out, wherever it is then, the room is clean, or some trees more, and the large detrimental and terminal destruction can be excused, then its “just” fatal, then we at least have these precious values still.

If the masses decide what to read they always get it wrong. i'm not against democracy, i'm for the least popular ten percent to deliberate?! But you know however much, its my own stance that, the masses are their own worst dictators, sheeple, rapaille, dread of caesars, emperors, noble men, popes and saints alike, joan of arc, giordano bruno? Tyranny? No tyranny of the masses, they were themselves the only ones there?! Go figure!! it was not uncommon for authors in the nineteenth to mock democracy, they abided, they even sung of corrupt emperors, they relished it, but the nineteenth did n't know what was to come, in subjectivity the nineteenth century authors dreamed their own personal lust crimes, like they were emperors of their imagination, but in the crimes of lust of literature, all artists are and were perpetually emperors who had their soldiers battle the waves, for a war with Poseidon. Insanity. But mankind, the masses, that is the genocidal maniac, the one who crawls his way through filth and slime, and makes of his fellow men heroes and martyrs, whereever he goes, as he makes not poseidon but his own nature his enemy, and then, he delights in others a sense of melancholy, in the brave a sense of beautiful despair, in the soldiers a sense of fortune and destiny in their downtrodden lives. The rotten world, therotten system. Something that would be dilligence or a virtue of some kind, he may stifle it in some sinfull disease if it went otherwise, many laws and prejudice has he made. And he knits together a fine cobweb of slime and slug, leaving the shell which we have now found, and mainly slime and slug is all that is left of him now. He has finished in his tracks. He lost his shell somewhere, he was an individual. He lost his art! He could retire, we will also see it is perpetually impossible to retire on this godsforsaken place!!




Irony is mainly this hysterical nihilism usually opposed to classical ideals, it is a hysterical despair out of a nihilist world. We had modernism now, we can see it does n't work, beauty is NOT subjective as if you say that you just replace beauty with hysteria all together. THAT in its turn is again IRONIC, the opposite of this irony, this defaitistic joke against the classic is the arch symbol, an image which is entirely new and allegoric and beautiful, as yet a tale of modern or commemorating classical reality. Finding ties and newer tales on even very old or original or natural concepts. Why not an allegory on a tomato in a supermarket? (If god does n't exist surely the artists and the arts exist so it can be any kind of theory as long as the matter is there.) Why do we have to destroy all this craftsmanship and have them work in cashier jobs and then finally fire them as they are useless? No these people are not useless, your society is useless, maybe you forgot thats how this society started?
Finally then we see here a resolution considering that conceptual art has ended, and becomes a very bleak ideal. Rather here we consider that we need to enrich the formal with the idea, have not kitsh, but provide the idea in it too. And have not the idea, but formalize it, and hence have a system of pure allegory and mythologization.
The esthetic movement is not the crisis, the spiritual oblivion is a crisis, as inspiration is the peak and liberty of spirituality it means not that it is not there, however we are free to indulge in esthetics with spiritual hypothesis, therefore the esthetic movement is the answer, that we have progressed beyond that means we have nothing left. "not even" the crisis. We are effectively within oblivion. We never NEEDED a crisis of esthetics except for MAKING it, but inspiration is perpetually more mighty then just. "ahh beauty is subjective we don't know what that is." and then have the modern world as a consequence. Here we are to a teaching to open our nostrils to breathe in nature, esthetics and metaphysics. As you already probably found yourself completely outcasted in modernism. And as it insulates so much from the past where we delve the roots of our truths. The OBJECTIVE opinion then can only establish what we see, the object as it is, but we are always keen on the inspiration doubling what is. If we then merely strangle everything by demeaning the object as a means for handling with our inspiration what do we have? This world?! And all its errors. Since there is nothing left without metaphyics we could say everything is metaphysics rather. WHATEVER to BREAK the FRICKING CRISIS, invent NEW mythologies if the old ones are so fascistic? But do SOMETHING; Don't BE so PASSIVE. Don't be so culturally DUMB and wash all under computer games and retarded games in the grass, advertising and cheap products. DO NOT call people who have interesting notions NERDS or SNOBS, maybe you could see they have all merit of their past, while you have the emptyness of a rotten carcass that is only consuming all beauty. If people would have known art to be valuable there be no cars and everyone would have a stack of art the size of a cathedral. but all is subjective, so that is not valuable, so we can ONLY have cars?! Everything is subjective so there is NO authority so adverts and banks are the ONLY authority?? The way to live then for this subject on average is his family values etc. where is the crisis in that then not rather? Little breeding pods is not a crisis but the esthetic movement was a crisis?? And it all becomes so extreme to allow for nothing but little cubicles built for this bacterial growth, without any art or without reckoning any outside impulse, nature or quality. As long as its unscrupulously provided a slide for his fun, no matter how big and hidious and unergonomic that is it BECOMES ergonomic in its kapital value, with subjects all want to pay to take a slide on it. Incidentally a slide to consume the whole world leave nothing of art or quality, or revery, at all?! This subjectivity then throws the highest sensitivies to the depths where it needs no attention, sustenance or a gaze in this depth. Again it is subjective, it is not an authority. And as it is subjective, there needs to be a whole, ordinary and business fashion. A lack of rococo in everything. And if it even smells like rococo then owh, what of this "nerdish", "american halloween"? "We done this" "This is fascistic". If its nerdish and american halloween yes then its approved, rediculous and then it is not fascistic, and when it is also comes from a philosophy and is new then they are utterly amazed. Owh my. YOu Have nothing to do with this time??
"Again, the balance has moved too far. A cell phone or an Ipad could have been part of a Victorian or a Baroque or a renaissence world. THat it is n't possible IS the whole religion today!? To see that becomes an obliterating, startling paradox, and the only way you will see the present culture and with it, modern philosophy and modern science, for what it is. The cult of the object builds but cubicles and fitness centers, it can't build a decorative feature like a castle or even hire an artist to compose a descent door ledge, in every way the esthetic is cancelled out and this would not be some kind of dogma?? Surely this terribly presumptuous mathematics which would each time become its own prophecy which it then needs to assert to be presumptuous is equally unattainable as the latest variation on dadaism?! I am in the same league of the ones who hardly could get emboldened if something was given, when something was "merely there" and were emboldened to point that out, How worthless it all was, but it is not hard now to be emboldened, for what is taken away, that of which is very practically there. And of which fundamentalists are growing, and in this "subject" a disaster, of which now I have to wipe the floor on which these arguments were comfortable. A manifest to greater extent it will appear, merely something that holds up the rug and see what dust was shovelled under there. A means surely that would contribute to uneducated or idle opinions, or a manifest to drive the adament superficial mind insane, perhaps. Generous I have been known to be, someone who took profit is not considered incapable to generosity. Defaitist is my natural state, but not for angrily hitting my head against the pavement having leaped from a tower and then also doing that repeatedly, as so many do and call it joy, scepsis but also a startling fall out of modernism had to be deu. If people have a naturally poor exploratory tendency, it would result in even the exploratory being a dogma. And a poor dogma if left without reality, esthetics, part of nature, ties to nature, anything apart of a satisfied subject or the ever growing satisfied subjects because it is a niche consideration. Where it would concern we are against freedom but merely want to restore that WHICH it was, lost?! Whereas that freedom hardly ever fulfilled any promises, that yes, we read Sade, but what he had and what is now modern is different, then surely Sade is not modern and the modern is not classical?! So WHAT is that, a notion which we would identify as far as it is formalized as artisan and as esthetics, this notion nurtures passions whereas now remains a hollow void. Where it concerns religion we indeed lend the notion of arching imagination, where we merely propose it to be allegorical arch symbols now used to restore culture, differing from any method of mere scientific study, as it is hopeless to assert any esthetic or religious notion with a prematuraly positivist stance, or expect any "occultist" enlightenment for that matter. A power greater then democracy or market which does n't exist. You need to add to that or -and as indeed- you would die otherwise, grow insane literally. Not to have said dadaism and abstraction was not innovative or the beauty of the naive was n't a point to be made, without which avant garde the modern masses would be standing there naked, but for which we must say, they are indeed in a world war standing indeed naked throwing shit at eachother, and its not improving much, not culture not composition not ecology benefits from everyone standing naked throwing shit at eachother, dispite it being a moderatly and so far most worthwhile solution. Gravity of extinction and any realization of that will have to dictate a scrutiny over composition is key, and indeed, priorities and novel ideas will have to be considered, auwh, why can I not get elected or even published hahh? It would even constitute that there certainly is n't any value in the mainstream, and that perhaps you could find value here. It should be forbidden, societies fall over values, and societies have fallen over someone who pointed out the lack of value of them?! Which in turn becomes a value, no matter how idle or how corrupt the author or the manifest may be!! He considers subjectivity is only an outer value, to love yourself you must also identify with the crowd, and I am the most dispickable as I find the crowd most dispickable, so at no point do i refer to any messianic nature, but alas, grave importance may be there, in he who ascribes it to him. Let me be the Devil over Christ then. As the world is astray. And as an astray world wolves will need to pack up and there is none so much a sheep left.I don't believe I am better then the crowd and i think the crowd is just naive, i am also naive, i was, i'm undoubtedly smarter and more characteristic then the crowd, to have written this, and have lived through my own artisan age entirely of my own devise, for which i frankly say i must fume at the magazines and current age still sucking at the common tit of subjectivity and consider that subjective. I can find my own tit, i suggest you do exactly the same. As for society then. Other then "everything to be subjective, which literally keeps spouting it out indiscriminate STUFF, and it would keep doing that untill the universe is gone, it be best if all commercials simply be replaced with STOP for a while. See how everything is so subjective then?! Meanwhile some stand in a psychiatry, walk in the staff room, and state, "i proclaim this a Horta Spiritual Steel Company and you will be my secretaries", that as far as i know is ANARCHY, chattering on modern aqcuisitions does n't amount to much compared to me. Neuschwanstein was a real castle, a culture, modern culture and entertainment and its temples of fun relies on a hypnosis to all dance and prance around the carton board derivative of that, a world as a culture, not something that is entirely honoust in its consideration of -lets call it- "fair subjectivity" no objection against creativity as you can see, but WInckelman ALSO existed, and without him no capitol hill. So i ALSO need to exist, and frankly without me or my considerations no future whatsoever, i'm sorry to say" Why is that? Because subjectivity is not a fair statement in this age. Not if you state it, in which case you aqcuire all this wealth and no artisan artistic or ecologic bound, no principle or worth. No dignity and no reservation in any way. You have no balance no scale, no composition. If you had it you would meander on a world of possibilities, not about the alleged “subject” that YOU need to believe in. In essence this world is a whole dance around this subject as the modern arts are a Mekka around a single urinal. Nothing more ironic then that indeed.

The resurgence of classical components and the formal must then be leading us to a form of fantasy, as art nouveau was already considerably fantastic, and whatever this reality does, in its “subjectivity” preoccupation it had to stow all beauty into fantasy and all fantasy into this distant realm of beauty.
It is a dogma then which we unravel here, why reality should be so bleak, and why it must end. Their reality, their new dogma, their new religion to which we are beholdended as no other. And which the underground screams at, scoffs and provokes.
This white page dogma, or white sheat dogma, is then defending how everything needs to be a liability at the expence of humans, a privilige, a right, and everything else, at the expence of artists esthetics, ecology.
That this dogma is at the root of the destruction of interests of ecologists and esthetics is key to realize and the only way to fully unleash the future lies in this destruction of this subjectivity. The destruction of the weight of the white sheat, and for the ones with substance to paint it, and be granted the right to paint it, at the expence of the dogmatic species on earth. Who always are too stubborn for innovation and too late for the root understanding of the prophets,... dialectics yes.
We speak here of the nineteenth century. Which we constitute as beauty and quality. Just to have a tape measure of something.
We speak here of the 1930 and avant gardists their breach and going into the constellation of the novel and the old, and modernism finally being a mere material cold shape introduced. A man not central anymore, a nightmare, nor demon, nor esthetic allegory central no more.
We speak of the emancipation of this nothingness, reaching over here from these 120 years with all its first glimmerings, 100 years with its first precursors, or 90 years in full swing developing, the 40’s where the fate of modernism was decided by the avant gardists, Juxtaposed by the fascists, depending on what you mean to see as the full deterioration of the human form and the human based esthetics.
Here Nietzsche also introduced the angelsaxan wheel of the dialectics of power. An unmanagable power, why was he dissatisfied with Ludwig the II of Bavaria? Nothing to be angry about. He would be angry now surely. And saw the errors of his ways back then. Again, after Schopenhauer if you don’t break him apart or find a way out of subjectivity things can get very bleak.
The progress optimisim since then. Has created a society rooted in the novel at full swing. What we claim here there is another 70 years looming or another 90 or 100 years. And it can not be just 12 million people brooding subjectively in cages being provided with ever novel things?!
Clearly on grounds of development we are almost completely full on the past 70 to 100 years of progress, it is wearing thinner, it is wearing out, it is wearing off.
We see the artisan is an undeniable tie to the ecologic. The esthetic as an undeniable tie to the security of the soul and the absence of the “next” new. An integration of technology within artisan goods. Where we revalue nature not as a tourist, but as an artist, looking back and noted we have a higher mountain before us, a romantic mountain, not some modernist hill we plant a flag and drink soda’s and dance a futile pop dance. This era bricked up in advertising out of consuming everything at the dawn of unhinged Americanism in the fifties literally needs to just dissapear, in economic or political degree? This manifest is by no means aimed at economy or politics, it needs to die a philosophical death, as most debates are currently on void politics and void economical ideas, everyone gets their plastics, everyone gets a bit of their soft neo orientations, whatever. These economic and political stance are worthless, opposed to the greater philosophy that we dug to get lost in. I assume the economic and political will just sit in the hole while all the pit caves in on them, the others can crawl out with this notion.
The notion “leave it up to the individual” only exacerbates this alien space culture. The notion of “all that should go for me should go for everyone else and what goes for everyone else should go for me” this may seem common sense, but it also seems very much like some science fiction disaster of a civilization. Not valueing sacrifice, splendour, wit, genius, labour, engineering, arts, aristocracy, wisdom, music, nothing at all. Such generalities will NOT be the generalities discussed here rather the outcome of the material goods FROM those generalities, in which case we may also return and speak both in mass weight of culture as well as history, merely in terms of art. The SUBJECT is sustained, it has FREEDOM and ABILITY TO DEVELOP, this is sustained by the culture hive mind development as it is currently being built. The question is. WHAT MORE IS there?! Polytheism to Monotheism with supersition and then atheism, grand, hypocrisy surely did n't die. Only every conceivable artisan craft and ecology died. For hysteria, a civil snout talking about the weather again today, as we considered, and nothing at all counter superficial or countercommercial available coming through. What depraved cause for us. What grim faith talking to ourselves, talking to walls, talking to floors, chairs, our glass. Seriously i dine with Goddess, i buy them drinks, then i go burry the glasses in a park further on. I do a whole world of surreal things, I say to psychiatrists i thought i was born from the wall paper and defend it as my religion and see how far they go along for the ride, as otherwise i would n't have a life. I would n't want to contribute to your simple reality anyway.

The only philosophical problem is the masses, if we are our own messias, what to do with them? I make myself no illusion that this will only strengthen those who are intelligent, intelligence, a word that is presumed an event to undistinguished people any time you would mention it, this glee and infatuation, this stubbornness over original lines, despaired as they are and little food of lectures able to distinguish them, however in this world any sporadic notion of intelligence would be lost in an ocean of the mute and blind and ironic, we only here read that their reality they defend so much inevitably ends, objectively, this would not be some phantasmagorea or a feat of entertainment we sit idle for but something we feel and act upon. This end of reality recertifies genius and myth and intelligence, in a way that it would have been discarded and passed over today. They repeat now, everyone has an opinion without anyone actually having one, and this reflects into the despair everywhere, the rage in an avant garde stupor below, and the absolute imbecility of the top. Then we meet people everywhere who as Schopenhauer says, have this “as it were fine chopped of a conversation. “ Its terribly unbearable. Again we may resume our ancient craft of beauty; when you read this, it is its sole purpose to reaffirm ties with the ancient splendor, yes, live among them, and intertwine with them, rather then this mass and pleb culture which needs to conceptualize everything, put it in a glass box and stare at it. This time is in that so unlively, so much a boring archeologist of what life is in culture, that we need to seek refuge in art, as Schopenhauer considered. Very much walk into our own art. And robe that art then in the splendor of spirituality. Where we are afraid that splendor is the only thing of spirituality we will ever have. So long it was that I presumed, if there is meaning, it must be in art.  This book is written for the philosophical souls that are currently wrecked and torn, Wrecked not by the rocky shores or on beaches but by thousands of screams. The notion of intelligence would at last make something as a key component as a patience, a stillness , the need to understand and elaborate, not just the vacuous rants and deliberations apart of the civil spilling sirup of indignation all over from their civil customs, to gratify a meagerness that they have left. But -and in this- also with considerations of the components of the avant garde acquisitions of the absurd, the surreal and the decadent. How few  are they who absorbed all this. Let it be known then, that it is among those of intelligence, who have absorbed Pessoa and Schopenhauer, Kubin, Kafka, Distopian authors and modernists, who saw where the course generally leads among the more significant intelligence, that the author of this manifest hit that dark wall too. And could n’t get out, words seemed to have no meaning. Only with these realizations could I rebuild meaning. It would then not be insignificant to offer it to other searching intelligence. Who will need that substance and intellect throughout their life, and not idle speculation, or the futile gibberish, the idle remarks of those he meets in every day life, not the mockery of truth, namely this kitsch spirituality people tend to indulge in at present time, or conspiracies underground, or civil indignation on which most of the mainstream debate is based, with the air of a mature boy fixed with a smug smile and a presumption of morality which it will contest of every time, even a catholic, all of which never realized any problem of enlightenment or modern thought. We simply have to deal with matter, consciousness, inspiration. Inspiration is truth I would have stated years ago. But it brings consequences for this archeological approach in society and science, which we can not accept, science is merely a means, it is by no means an end purpose and a worthwhile faith, not at least where it does n’t place man -or female which we would suggest, the decorative, not in the least then irrational too in its metaphysics.- and art and inspiration central, on the accounts of all that in the passed being understood as religion, limited as it was to the diar need to provoke of the free and uncivil, unadjusted spirits, now we need to reevaluate the crafts of the serene then, and the marvel, the freedom in which we can do that and claim our own power as artists now without lords, is an opportunity to be celebrated, we will have soon the leaders and artists of old to join us in our palaces as our children and brothers.








It goes without saying that this and the past is a very worthwhile, literate, considerate, educational, and otherwise completely unpopular topic. You would say what brings it then to trod on these parts? Well none other then build the pyramid in reverse, we welcome cosplayers, intelligent people and scholars of classical art and the surrealists etc everywhere underground, as black metal elitists etc, gothics, punks, martial industrial, militant people, roman soldiers, battle reenactment, etc etc, to cling into this and get through it. We fill the dictionary with classical art. And thus gain members. Then we drain the mainstream from anything valuable as it already has very little to offer. Eventually, all these publishers and pop songs of whom get around and eventually deplete and repeat so much they stack on their mountain of plainliness, they will become the underground, and we will become its masters and dictate the world. WE who are, UNPOPULAR!! It seems natural you find yourself rather unpopular finally, even when you could never fathom yourself or recognize your own personality, when all they are trying to sell you does n’t fascinate you, it took me a long time to understand these adds could actually have anyone making money. It is very natural that we regard regular people in the streets as aliens as they have no perception of a classical notion, and live the modern debate. They don’t really see us, we can debate them and they usually find it interesting, but other then that they will do nothing for us and establish no real connection as anything goes for them. This world or the next one,  they are entirely indifferent to it.  Whereas we would say, this world is entirely desperate and hysterical, it IS eventually the mass main character, it recognizes itself in it. The classical and intelligent spirits have long taken back, and assumed another consciousness then them. We who live in old rotten books! THEY are radiated with sloth, materialism, you may pass the television at any minute and these people see shows of con artists, mansions, fat cars, how they can't cope with being affiliated with poverty and poor standing, and yes, otherwise you could n't sell your products, the world is a con itself, the media is. It constantly oozes and vomits a draining infatuated childishness on us that we should be perpetually dumb imbeciles and moderately entertained with futile things. Then you are everywhere confronted with people who eat and drink, shit and piss and give nothing back, their chitter chatter is nauseating, then if you’d ever pass them a point they will reply what nerve for you to shit and piss too and come up with something like that, they shrug their shoulders and think nothing of it, as any reasoning is hopelessly confusing to them. All the museums and all classical reality is filled with dirt to them, and there should be no consequences for it. But their reality is sucked out by the ancients delivering emptyness, defaitism and lack of meaning, their heads are off, rock punk metal, and concept art depleted the world, but it does n’t end there, it does n’t end here, we no longer educate them, they stagger off without us, it should be polite we bid them farewell before we lock the doors to our own world before them. And the kind ones can be pittied, so often did they repeat their rubbish, we are tired of it, but so many are souer and cling to us for attention to them in all kinds of pungent ways. They bloat and explode of their indignation for any value but their pizzas and their excrements.
It is inevitable that this paradox and this clash comes to a grotesque new reality. As Huysmans we are dismayed with the proceeds, as our love for the arts as his love for the arts makes us desire our own Church. They even made all efforts this rabble who parasite on the avant garde to tear it all down and to stand there touting the ordinary on the ruins of the classical media, it all sunk into oblivion. We could now consider Courbet a troll, smothering our art with ungraceful obscenities, of which criticism is always a loss, give a constructive alternative, they have never given one, and have torn it all down. Giving way to the degeneration of mass culture and the vulgarity of the masses, we should criticize God and serene beauty? Thats a really smart idea, and then when everything comes out as individuality and you fought for that are you left with anything that escapes your hysterical hungriness for this critique? This is modern man. They wanted their opinion about everything. Now we start over and they may well get bored somewhere else but not on our beautiful graceful and serene culture. We acknowledge that all considerations of beauty is communication, they do not just account as our opinion, we find the ones who are left in their vapid cage hive, where beauty needs to be for haunted houses or computer games or its incomprehensible to them. That its a culture in decay should essentially interest us, except if we could find our own place and if it would n’t be so destructive, We have a tendency to thrive on polarization and condescendence of course, on consensus, which you could very well see on how everyone seeks consensus on this subjectivity and refrains from saying anything else anymore that would really be distinctive, a whole culture is then based on screaming and ranting and pounding and blasting to keep all this stupidity around us out. We should n’t at all be their trolls of their daily lives which is all they can understand, of which Goethe described as “the waiting room of hell” and retreated to his solitary room drawing again. Well they had something left, and the environment we are confronted with opposed to that leaves something to complain about. Everyone to challenge the audacity of that is a dogmatic vacuum cleaner of any meaning.
As the masses follow the masses the energy gets sucked out of it. Cars developed, from 20's to 2020 the rise in volume, the musical excessiveness and newer pulse each time, from Bleus to Rock to Metal to Heavy Metal to Trash to Death to Black Metall. Porn seeks newer excesses, there IS NO status quo, it does n't exist, but people are passive, and cramped, they are stuckup and idle, if there is any feat in this world its that artists, leaders or intelligence, moves them. There is no other reality, therefore subjectivity is its own trap, you can't get out, I managed, you can be welcomed to get out, THEY can't get out?!!
As they always followed genius and new directions, i’m sorry but there is going to have to be that. 
So inevitably we have reponsability here, if we wanted it or not. We write and we have to write a new world?!
How on earth to do that with everyone stuck in the ONE opinion “owh but what you hold as an ideal will not be an ideal to everyone else.” SERIOUSLY that IS the only thought they have, a wise man always writes new treatizes, but they repeat themselves over and over again, and they fail to see the masses always conspired in a few banal things. We have to actually solve a few things. This individual development was a philosophy that went okay for a while, be it in romantic or early industrial age. But it was decidedly  a dead end.
How can we get out of the fact that we are just subjects? That we can say or do what we want but we can just build cages and say nothing about beauty? Or composition?! How will we restore the oceans then??
HOW will we SURVIVE??
We are just bactaria growing if we can’t speak on beauty art or composition, and we are just taking over and expanding then untill we are dead.
But BY MEANS of that subjective opinion. No one said there could n’t be something else to believe, they all followed the one thread, until it is in books now, that even Schopenhauers vision might be subjective??! Thats what climax hysteria and irony is finding in its post truth. Now then we argue, we orient ourselves to the preraphaelites and reverse schopenhauer and reverse Hegel and all those philosophers and see there is A LOT of religion today and the wise said A LOT to get to this religion so what on earth should we then do? Consider it done?  Consider it all over?  Apparently when it is a religion something is worng with it, something here stinks. IF all the wise would have concentrated on beauty, and stuck to describing everything we consider beautiful it would n’t have gone so deranged, then beauty would n’t have been SUBJECTIVE, we would have ANY word left. Since mainly if everything is subjective you just destroy words, at no point are you stating anything significent when you destroy words, vent and rant indifferently of any principle, or drag the whole world and indeed its BEAUTY with it down into a drain of bacterial growing once again and that be the end of it. We need to recapitulate from the beginning and realize TIME does not exist. SO any museum or scientific value is perception and a construction of ritual and new rituals and by definition FALSE within conceivable reality. DREAM AND IMAGINATION, not verity but SENSUALIZATION, the sensual or SERENE of deity or angels, can absolutely be TREU.
Therefore we can say we have gutted all the classical cultures and the churches for nothing.
We have created a belief in cars and consumption and industry for nothing.
And they ran off with it, now we are stuck with these who perceive this as a dogma in stead of a crisis, they neglect to suffer from it and all the people who we would like to speak to are stuck in between this hopeless strife and struggle of the plain, moreover their swelling and expanding leaves the ecology and our future in perfect oblivion.
And now any consideration is of course, “unpopular.”
But that all evaporates when you conceive.
A
The structure is expanding and this is not the moment to get a vacation
B
we are all free now dancing on the carcass of life.
C
this can not last.
D
what follows is, society is bound to collaps WHEN this is understood and ONLY when this is understood.
You can effectually NOT get out without this.
There will just be a cacophany and grand lunch eating the earth with the debilitated, the average, the babblers.

If desire has left you  to believe in something, may it be beauty, and that desire will laugh last, even later then science, as it is life, and the composition made out of desire, is rather the opposite of the defaitism and the lack of dream and imagination of science.

To worship beauty and be stuck with the stupid bimbo inside of it indifferently shaking her ass in all directions or plucking all of your feathers, is the final verdict, it is, again, life. But we are stuck with art, and hence metaphysics, what is a philosophy of the deplorable of life, is in itself the counter metaphysics, a counter metaphysics will suck the life out of everything. So we believe in metaphysics, in the concepts of words carried by life, in that thing of beauty, in art and composition, which we must hold as a manifest to and if we want to finally preserve   the earth, and grow from nothing out of Mars, therefore it can not be “subjective”. The era of subjectivity is over.
We CAN deduce from that that the beauty of young woman exists, and that the intelligence of it is under debate, we can certainly consider some woman intelligent, as much as some men are intelligent.
Other then that we consider this myserious intelligence a “nuanciation” or to be lost in perpetual nuanciations (much like this author and this manifest) one is incapable to portray the irrelevance of grammar and spelling substrate  and not supremacy over insight. That comes from inspiration, newer dreams.
But the masses are perpetually trapped to believe and to cling to the past.
And now, this all sardonic, malevolent idea, that this manifest is, comes at the time of the “new” when the masses are held before ultimate choices, and where their dispickable and most peoples powerlessness will be reversed against their own kind.
And where the prowess and resiliance, and superiority of intelligence, does not tolerate simple babble and politics and ape supremacy anymore. Not the basic vain lies and concoctions of bitches.

When a deity is not universal for sure the key to the imagination which makes it spiritual and for it to instill awe, is the quality of the imagination which is serenity. And that for sure opposed to hysteria and superficiality is universal. I object to the fact that when everything is subjective there is nothing. Believe in nothing is to create nothing. As many have done. We need to undo this now. With all the exact science now since the enlightenment We did n't learn anything. Yes the imagination is part of dialectics and yes now we need a synthesis of that imagination, to escape the constraints of the modern world
 We are not saying religions can not be real but with the problem of the object to a subject we discarded and made the imagination horrific to the civil in the romantic era; which has its advantages and disadvantages. Beauty became virtual, the artisan was lost, then again it resulted in a world without power or center. A thing we need to reestablish now all on our own.
 Atheism and religion versus imagination that is but a distinction our modern language would like to make, in an organic natural reality imagination art and spirituality are one, there is enough double meaning and mystery of perception to work on the majesty of classical art, without it we are like a plucked bird
But as you can't decide for someone else what truth is imagination is universal and serenity the value of divinity yes, opposed to ironic imagination you could say
 It doesn't have to be Just a story as two hundred years of that brought us today to the end of art, modernism surely is n't a Bernini, so it has a philosophy, it makes a concept of nothing out of what should be prophecy, therefore it is a paradox, and plainly, wrong.
 Words can merely establish or plan and plot the esthetics of this world and represent deities in allegory. To look for spirituality and not be a warrior for the artisan would then also be a paradox. But here we do state that art and therefore fetishism is widely important.



If everything is subjective we would forget one thing.
That intelligence exists, that the here and now exists.
The misrable will go everything is JUST subjective, the masses will go everything is subjective, and the Nietzscheans will go everything is MY SUBJECTIVITY.
Is there no way out?
Something we can agree on?
For reference we can all agree that these words and this manifest was inspired on a white dove that came to my window, the theory of relativity i read before that did n’t inspire me at all, actually i could understand it, i’m much more of a black hole myself. And besides. I could n’t figure a way out of this depth and subjectivity even before i read it. So the main things that got me out where Waterhouse, Leighton, Draper, Bougeureaux. EXPLICIT beauty. That is now miraculously forgotten, or even dispised as we realize, because everything, above all; HAS to be subjective, there is apparently no room, nor any consideration of anything else. Nietzsche perhaps tried, but his concept which was practiced nor his general mass popularity could not solve in the least extent the problem, popularizing Nietzsche will not solve a thing today. Popularizing Sade will not solve a thing either; we need a NEW insight on the whole thing!!
It would seem that a NEW insight is likely not understood, check, it was at this moment not yet understood, it would seem, as new insights go, that this goes for everyone and will achieve significent popularity some time. And it seems. THAT an APPEAL from SOMEONE INTELLIGENT would somehow come, suddenly, and still be heard, loudly, without compromize to the masses usual entertained and debilitating stances.
It has come then?
Can you find the other intelligence and get them to one point?
And let them tell you how to get this stack of shit sorted?
I’m sure Buddha sit  there like candy on a stick is not going to solve it now.
I’m sure Christ turn the other cheek is not going to solve it now.
I’m sure Kant everything is subjective will not solve it now.

 

It goes without saying and, untill i realized this just now i struggled with it but.
We are hypocrites supreme here.
What goes for the masses should n’t go for us.
And what goes for us should n’t go for the masses.
If one clearly IS NT part of the masses things get very confusing at this point.
Since the masses say you should be part of them and a person to be found to agree with is hard to find.
Someone to be able to WRITE or to see THROUGH culture is now pushed in the depths and one is unable to find an intelligent person. If you had noticed that, welcome. If you were just living and not minding much, yes you are the masses.
Now fascism is hard not to embrace, “booo” let me clarify. CHRIST HITLER CARS
those are the three things the masses ever believed in.
They have NEVER Changed nor will they ever see the light.
That they now get a car commercial does n’t mean they don’t exist and have developed freedom suddenly.
Freedom to see the carcasses of dead arts yes.
But there is no life anymore without prophecy.
And there is no more prophecy without art
and there is no more art without beauty.
And there is no more spirituality without beauty.
And in that order and with that perception we set forth to a whole other course of society and idealism.
Completely different from what we had the past 200 years.
With the reversal of “fortune” of Immanuel Kant, in many ways the reversal of perception, of which we now know blinds the masses and the cultures, and did blind even the philosophers, but not anymore!!
It DOES however now come to the table.
First off
That a manifest should be written to initiate the SURVIVAL of the species before anything else.
That a manifest should be written on esthetic or material physical artistic beauty in a second stage.
That a manifest should be written hence on what the MASSES should do as their weight, which is a dumb weight, actually provides a sustainable future.
That this would rid of time space and causality is key.
That it would provide concrete and esthetic and physical solutions and at least appeals to all underneath to offer these and get things SORTED OUT is key.
That we have NO RESTRICTIONS is key.
Lastly, it would be that a morals for the masses, is only befit certain provocations. FINALLY we already know everything was said on that behalf, and we also know who said it.
So we can PROVOKE the masses.
But at the very last it should not be a concern nor should anyone boost of the beauty of perversion confronted by something so adamently bad tempered and grim and docile in its capacity to comprehend any sensuality or deviation on beauty. It is entirely ones own bedroom, and people will not understand. Nor should we have any inclination to share our bedroom then with the maidens who’m it would concern the least bit.


A PUTRID ENTRY

The age of mankind as a liability is about to end.
We can say, not as modern, modernistic, economic, pragmatic people would state, that, namely phrase it thus; 

“As parasites, worms, slaves, or rodents, among nature, on nature, that parasite worm slave or rodent its existence ends.”
To phrase it more classically.

The age of mankind as a commodity is about to begin.
We can as well say, with a classical mind.
“The Age of Gods begins.”
Deities, elves or fae, angels or vampires.
What should become of this.
Mere robes and architecture.
With all these instruments to nature as our arts.
But there is no other choice.
The ecology and the expansion of mankind.
Technology and composition.
Make it mandatory that this age ends.
And we do now play chess with the faith of the world
It wants to die.
This fate of the planet is in our hands.
We want ALL to live!!
And we are the only Gods available.
We are the last card they had.
How more naked can we be?!
How more naked must we be in order not be beasts or idiots.
And to hold that to ourselves a sermon
not to be beasts or idiots.

VERSE V "People are obsessed with the past, its beauty and nature, and other people are obsessed with the future or futurism itself. I say let them be,"
VERSE VI "Meanwhile I can only hope for a better world, where metal bands, youth as much or at least its prowess dedication and agility, opposed to this "civil democracy"..."
VERSE VII "I'm for communist economics, but what identity and art does it have? Especially now? We can see the subject lacks hands, ears, eyes, boobs, color, (so beautiful as colors are, would one live in a world where all artists have to be color blind? Maybe we are not all as unique?!"
VERSE IIX "Because one thing no one reckoned, but The Third Reich was a temporary decor, so too Modernism is a mass movement, and mass movements are a hype, an idea, its born from books and destroyed by books."
VERSE IX "As I write the so manieth introduction. And this is, at long last what will be held to light first by me. To speak to those mysterious lurking with me underground. Let me say nice to meet you. And then, that we know people do not know life, that modern life is a lie. When we read the older books of rotten paper and rotting sentences,..."
VERSE X "Why not, rather then conceptualize into more ideas, would you not conceptualize beauty? A fractal in a nihilist machine. Why not have pagan markets in galleries, entirely classic and well crafted. And sell vegetables? But owh. We are selling art there, we are the treu ancestors of Duchamp, i’m afraid they are the same bourgois they ever were..."
VERSE XI "Why don't you NOT eat two pieces of fruit a day shipped from all over the fucking planet what are you fucking crazy? Why don't you NOT eat three meals a day of delicious supermarket food. Why don't you NOT go to the fitness center, why don't you NOT get sports goods and goods for anything... "
VERSE XII "If one is eager to learn, and able to find information, one never needs to be a subject, one can grow into a personality. Confirmed with the visual and visionary. The Subject is the womb, the civil is the offspring of the masses,
VERSE XIII "Did you ever notice how easy it is to get along with someone? Who is n't despaired and ill informed on modern theory? How someone who read books and is also an autonomous mind, is always a friend and you never met at random,...é
VERSE XIV "Culture is in decay, futility interest is promoted everywhere. "About what you can not speak, be silent of it" Yes, and leave everyone to loiter, decapitate intelligent esthetic discourse? "Time will always be the same, best to redraw in arts and releave yourself from the will to compete in society." (Schopenhauer) Yes, and that world, that thought, created a reaction,... "
VERSE XV "Opinionation leads to deconstructive arguments, where you can explain a philosophy and people will throw it away out of the order of the opinion, while needing no philosophy to come up with for themselves. "
VERSE XVI "We speak to an audience no one speaks to. We who know some of the past 200 years of philosophy and art have a very different view then the uneducated. They boost opinions while you try to give them arguments..."
VERSE XVII "We can conclude that serenity is attached to the esthetics of the imagination, the lack of belief in esthetics produces hysteria, which meanders into advertising and then gets absorbed likewise within mainstream fiction. "
VERSE XVIII "Beauty of classical merit is now dorment in all these hives underneath. TIme to bring it out!! These are the antidotes to commercial nihilism, foundations of a faith in serenity,... "
VERSE XIX "An artist would also have the duty to compose in between concept or kitsh, the very outskirts of both, the technique and nuanciation of the classical, whereas the innovation and idea in itself certainly is n't as valuable as they think.

VERSE XX "Beauty of classical merit is now dorment in all these hives underneath. TIme to bring it out!! These are the antidotes to commercial nihilism, foundations of a faith in serenity,... "
VERSE XXI "Polarization with the mainstream will grow more mainstream. Likewise if the rich want to keep their wealth, something they increasingly want to guard through violance, because they have no ideology? How could they have an ideology? They are considered subjects all the same. "
VERSE XXII "So deconstructing deconstructivism essentially comes down to, what we could consider to look where the weight falls when something is said. To construct we can always see that to construct must come in the first place when reason is practiced since reason itself is only means... "
VERSE XXIII "What is repeated throughout here is the first work Kant wrote "All the planets of all the stars are inhabited and the best men live furthest away from the Earth." So where is the weight? He basically transformed God. Turned it into aliens. "
VERSE XXIV "Christ said, "I am the son of something more powerfull beyond the skies." that at least is in summary the thought, of which was later contested, by Spinzo and Kant and their influence (hence they are prophets) mainly and for which we have inherited decay, "
VERSE XXV "Is there really not something more powerfull then (for) what can be achieved (in) art? Or is there really nothing within art so powerfull? No art has to be "for art" This is absurd?! THIS is a logical phallacy. Again Camus saying "suicide is the only philosophical problem is a logical phallacy." NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND? "What to build cathedrals for is the only philosophical question."
VERSE XXVI "In essence what Kant should have said is, and what later artists were mistaken for is that no work of Christian deity or Husymans or Oscar Wilde is so mistakenly different. It projects or "condences" into matter as Delville said. "
VERSE XXVII "We craft reason with only one metaphysical purpose, to create a canvas where mankind can walk in. "
VERSE XXVIII Again, where we used to pull the chariot of labour, where we used to delve up a temple out of the resistence of mechanics, where a structure forms through engineering capabilities, this no longer applies,
VERSE XXIX "So at last, when we made everything useless, beauty and nature kick in again, yes we can agree with every troll and beat every troll with it. Yes you are allowed to your platform. What DO you have to say?!"
VERSE XXX "We argue that the solutions, for a ritualization of life lie in the Romantic and Symbolist ideals be it reversed to what they should be. "
VERSE XXXI "To criticize the economy is its greatest advert. We can only let go of it, take off like a balloon into space, and require an artisan and mythologic prowess and severity in our imagination. As any third of faith,... "
VERSE XXXII ""We don't believe in an ecological foot print, nor do we believe in consumption. If everything is in a balance, there is no ecological foot print nor consumption. "
VERSE XXXIII We will learn from neoclassicism, and build grand decors of nature more beautiful then nature, we'll do coral reef transplants and regrow the forests of Europe now. And there shall be no debate or deterrant upon that. Fisherman will be hired to dive and regrow dead zones, and transplant coral, grow coral in aquariums, any way we can.
VERSE XXXIV We want ALL the ocean floors dead zones RESTORED, we want ALL the ten trillion fish BACK, we want the European forests restored and art deco and art nouveau high rise to replace the subjects houses and suburbs.
XXXV "For the restoration of artisan dignity in mankind, resisting the technological nothingness, and living with the means superior of space technology which was always space technology, "
TRISITHEA TO THE PUBLISHER.
VERSE I "I have here a manifest that will be read just as well by any citizen on this planet, It concerns the millions of artists who been dumped into the gutter by Immanuel Kant, and would like to decorate supermarkets now "
VERSE II There is also a reason while you already are saying and thinking “this person can better work in a factory” that is part of your religion. Most of you are just as religious as the high days of the inquisition.
VERSE III "Mind you. There are only three options, or this manifest is read by anyone, and then all underground movements are coming to play ball with the ehh “your” mainstream and your reasonably alien society, or the deep green resistence of this world and other sabotage “your” bacterial growth culture... "
VERSE IV "Let it be you then to read this, I beg of you, and try to understand it somewhat, as for the intelligent reader this is a load more apparent then for you. This book is in advance a classical masterpiece, reasonably anachronristic none the less are there indeed readers of older books."
The problem of Subjectivity in Modernism

HIGH DELUSION




A PUTRID ENTRY
"Would the medieval times have considered their cathedral, the pride of their culture, to be pollution? No, they believed something, moderatly, as much as today, and today, people believe something, as much as in medieval times, hence we can say indeed with Schopenhauer, "nothing has changed", as yet, everything has changed. And we can say, mankind produces always like a slug, its shell, it never pollutes. You reap what you sow. So would you not consider, that pollution today is our cathedral? Then would you not convert from that religion for any Gods sake???!"

Unlike the archeologist who sees but death of culture, we incorporate in ourselves all the ideas and allegories, means and artisan proficiency as our own. We stand with the CD player, with the casette player, with Vinyl We stand with the first personal computers, with the first very computers being built, we stand with so much more however. Nothing is dead, all these within progress hysteria, which is the end of progress optimism, became dead, as things had to be newer, however we see none of these things as dead, in effect its a disease and a collective delusion to think any of it dead… we need to take to a new beginning. But this is not some spiritual breach, it is on the contrary what crystalizes out of the current canonized teachings deficit. The cosplay and spirituality is running amok. The artists are all at a startling finish line. The underground is still picking up pace. We need to effectively walk into paintings, placed on deserts, and decide without technical or ecological limits there, what our culture should be. That it should be skyscrapers with adds on them. Is in doubt. In the formal we find our refinement again, which the substrate of mediocre artists not minding of the lazy leisure and soft amuse of the masses could n’t harness in the surrealists and conceptualists, of which meandering hysteria now of those ideas leaves us no solace, and which avant garde type of art remains now futile in the constant bombardment of the debilitated futility of advertisement, and brainless pageants of boyish or posh stars constantly reminding us of the poor IQ of our audience, poorer as to Westerners perhaps some underdeveloped region of africa. To Westerners standards, their culture is indeed such a slum of ill repute remote savaga and barbarian devise. Not would we condescend any neocolonial deficit at the root of Western influence in any way. 

As Baudelaire said of Belgium. Pauvre Belgique, now we can say, Pauvre Monde, alas, they do not want to publish us, their world is bleeding dry, pop songs running in cicles, Garbage esthetics and subject esthetics, minimalism, nations left as spheres of stupidity radiating their civil news and futile shows over their crowds, conceptual garbage everywhere, everyone stuck in “modernism” we could write a very bleak distopian novel, it would be a very pale mirror, see them sit there… the underground is fuming of rage and disgust. Literary works of brilliance must of course carry that staple of misanthropy and the anti civil too. Thus we regroup, rebuild here. Where else? We who by means of the fury of later stages of metal found ourselves back with the classics, where else would we be? I write to spiritual elves, satanic vampires, or christian angels rather. Something with, a beauty enrobed, a cloak of the decorative arts. If you had not been so timid yet for that. Then I believe you are my kin and audience!!
A distopian novel? And why would we write it? They already live their fiction. A biography of mediocrity perhaps. Why no Monty Python on modernism? After they mocked away into oblivion all the classical. There is surely a lot of myth in the past, yet as soon as you delve it all up, one must be met by the despair and hysteria of those without ever having come across a philosophy or a classical verse. In essence a religion is somehow atheistic, as modern romantic fiction is somehow religious, there is no status quo possible to hold this notion that you can wear an islamic scarf right now, but not a christian cross. By Means of emancipation and the plausability and serenity and also liberty if not necessary libertinism of deities ALL IMAGINATION IS ONE. Therefore it would not befit anyone to wear a picture of Dracula or a rock band or even a popular movie or star as that is all part of the imagination and part of modern imagination. What we have then is a new cult not secularism. Equally we can say they refute when you speak of ideals "it never works" so we can only speak of grave disasters as its the only thing that works?! Nor does the left wing have any stories, the stories are all done by subversive artists they can not stand with their moral subject highground. A thing of which we delve into here. We can then define a treu essence or the notion of spirituality, or even religion, now not in what the deity is, but how it is depicted, being somewhere in a serene quality of artisan prowess in between the kitsh and futile decorative stance, and the conceptual minimalist stance where everything is gutted out. The subject stance that does n't know any object, has never been very good at confiding beauty in nature or man or art. Not in the last hundred years. It has delved into dadaism and abstraction, brutalism and all the other isms of modernism, to be considered then Futurism and industrialism, fascism progress and consumption, capitalism and communism. We need to bring imagination into religion and bring religion into imagination. So far with the thread of Spinoza and Schopenhauer and others there is only Naked Prophets or Suicidal Gods from that. And everyone else and this culture, be it instigated by its prophets, again, they do exist. As soon as it becomes material, it becomes prophetic. Whereas then as soon as it leached on individualist main theories it assumed individuality, but it was never established what that was? These modernists forgot we needed to find the object?? It would lead us to conclude that this object is first of all certainly metaphysical as we can not know it. And second of all we also assert that it SHOULD n't be mediocre and discardable when it would be MATERIAL, but modernism got BOTH of them wrong?
This manifest and everything I do is dedicated to the first readers and their rhetorical beauty. You who read the Upanishads, Hesiod, Homer, Christ, Mohammed, Dante, Cervantez, Milton, Swift, Byron, Blake, Caroll, Sade, Schopenhauer, Lautreamont, Holderlin, Tieck, Delville, Tolkien, Breton, along with so many others who would not rest on their laurels here, and ended in Foucault, who ended up with “one thought and suspend with all this babble”. And in which realms of these readers I mean to stay and repose, and on which religion of literacy I mean to build, and which affiliates I mean to find in this modern hysteria. Everyone else has apparently created some normality stasi, some commerce gestapo driving in idle circles and consenting to a status quo, sucking up car commercials as the cars they indeed mean to buy or sell along with all the other garbage, and profess artisan beautiful nations as poor, and ugly nations garnered in trash and unsustainability entirely considered as rich nations. These three second hive minds is basically the main issue that I am fuming and of who’m can provide me no credit or five seconds worth of attention span for this manifest which i then have to find an entirely new media for to get the same readers as i would pride myself to have and as Marx or Kant or Nietzsche be it so few, at least, Nietsche, he could conversate with Wagner and Ludwig the II, and just write an intelligent letter to a university, while modern intelligent people have to be completely scoffed and be worked down entirely on disastruous and trivial bureaucratic grounds and to annoy their already certain autism which would be considered just a lack of disdain of going nowhere Schopenhauer, Holderlin, anyone who wrote a biography on goethe before 1940, anyone who wrote about the symbolists before 1970 etc. I would like to find an audience that is no longer spoken to, as we are the thousands of who’m are not commercial or popular at all. This status quo then dispite ruling the whole world, if you bear with me, on these disastruous pages, it has some severe issues the world can not ignore and which will need to be adressed. It can only be done by this manifest by that, which is nerve to say that, and which is frustrating me dearly to actually believe that sometimes, both the rise of any esthetics and the collaps of the lack of esthetics relies on these pages, believe it or not, to grant you your hopes or your nightmares with that remains to be proven. Also considering no average intelligence will bother reading 200 pages to start to see my point, and get even remotely into this new world which i am proposing. I don’t go about this in any other way then those who have created all the artisan arts, sculptures and urban planning in the past. But WHAT should we build now exactly if we humbly appealed to people we could do that? Well exactly!! There have been some philosophical difficulties slowly growing out of modern philosophy to realize and prove spirituality, beauty, the use of progress, the limits of decadence, the notion of a certain decline in fashion or at least the vailidity of gothic opposed to mainstream ordinary clothing, which gothics need to be scoffed now. I can only bear to succeed in reversed and shaking the tree for the dead birds to fall out of it...



“Frail child, you are not ready to let go of the present, and with that will I know it is my sadistic pleasure, my vision the future, and my only fulfillment, the resentment of mass culture, to see you suffer more, when the present is taken from you violantly. Yes when this pleasent may, this solace to your heart, peace of mind, in which you vest your usual gibberish and your game shows, quizzes and talkshows, your daily news cycles, your loops of the most outdated pop songs, and circle in a nice bubble car, and spout some wishywashy, very conserned considerations, almost indignated, ahhh, Should a doom be announced that became unbearable to you. Yes a Tyrants or Emperors Doom and Gloom upon inconspicuous dustgrains scattered in these decrepid storms as there would be, in change, something of a flood to wash over the present. It must be some wicked ingenuity. That you read decay here, this snot and drivle culture, and as you will read, you will see it all decay as it is that decay, it will stifle as it already froze, and rot as its already rot!! Step over it with me. We shall need breathe no new life into this. It is a generations carcass!”
cosplay is just another word for the future and i think the word cosplay as the world larp should be under spiritual scrutiny and under a severe spiritual council it would constitute as a cowardly accompliciteness to modernism fradulance, basically as you say "i am a cosplayer" you say "i verify you as a business suit to be highest in society and the only eminence." cosplay is relative, on the contrary. Business suits should be relative, then maybe there will be architecture. Let fashion and fiction lead the way to culture, to architecture, to art, don't let business suits ruin it for you, they will just convince you to buy cheap kitsh. In any case if you have a tree nearby, then you don't have to NOT wear Ancient Greek or Roman clothing right? If you have a farm. You need Not NOT wear pagan or otherwise the ideals. And of the ideals to that fashion and the repercussions for a general faith and religion going on, and which is meant to be destroyed by this, is the next treatize. IN any case cosplay is taking a modern stance against fantasy it is not at all apreciative of history or fantasy. Why on earth get into the cult? Why on earth create a cult to be part of the cult? It would be like a gothic saying Halloween is the only day you could wear clothing. Its just halloween fashion. Halloween happens to be the only lucid day of the year.

FIRST CHAPTER MANIFESTO

AYRIS MANIFESTO
DECONSTRUCTING DECONSTRUCTION
A dark tomorrow is always brighter then a bright yesterday?!
I wrote a system in self defence against conceptual chaos, which I saw in most part in my years at the academy. I talked to a poet who was thinking much like me back then, that “words did n't really matter anymore”, “that they did n't have meaning”. I traced all esthetic objects back to artisan styles, every nail can be considered part of medieval or 1910 or 1970's artisan or conceptual esthetics, thats VISIBLE. LOOK at nails from medieval times and put them ALL in a line towards this age? THAT is esthetics??? Thats what i claim. if you don't agree with that thats fine. If you want to make YOUR words meaningless thats fine. THis is the thread to solidify regression into a classic decorative esthetics. FOR MYSELF AND THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND IT BEFORE HAND. And i also state that the entire "new" idea dislocates from the past which is n't at a distance at all. Us to rebuild the Acropolis. There is no esthetic law against it other then the. "owh no we have to respect historic accuracy." But this itself is a state of a new scientific conservativism out of which you do not get out?? This whole philosophy EXISTS. And is prevelant throughout. Its okay if you want to make your entire meaning apparatus, your words, meaningless by dabbling into all this owh what about this what about that chaos. But i like to construct a word equipment i could actually use and work with. TO battle and comprise an alternative method towards esthetics then today. Hahhhh why don't you read the full manifest then tell me what you think. Don't just bicker about details please??? This manifest details a method to defend against the conceptual chaos and modernism and left right debate, and regress as was initiated the proposal by Michel Foucault. The very method of discourse of which we see an entire sect growing into modernism is something realized by almost no one, and certainly its hard to escape the logic. But it was constructed by enlightenment philosophy. The critique on speculative systems, of which William Blake, the Irrationalists, Delville and a lot of symbolists, Alfred Kubin, The Surrealists and Black Metal were the most ardent opponents. This manifest means to be a final blow against modernism, to the great relief and comfort then, and benefit to the esthetics and the underground movement and its esthetics. To dislocate society in a manner the mainstream can not survive it, (as if it can survive itself??) and needs to go a completely different course. Or drive those that juggle their modern philosophies further into the critical non speculative direction to their last defence, in which they will go insane as their solipsism is finally, another solipsism, whereas we mean to enter into the world again. And change it only where architecture and ecology is concerned, the abstract flutter about subjects does not concern us. As its guaranteed to keep society and its giant stack of garbage left to spout untill we drown in it. A thing indeed on a finite planet, is not considerate, indeed we can say, where we were distracted towards the subject being some abstract identity, we lost our eyes, our hands, our ears, our nose, our senses, the meadows, the forests, the ecology. Again this is a manifest which allows you to see modernism, and find a definite meaning against the very plausable theories of existentialism, minimalism and nihilism. It pronounces there a duality of kitsh and concept found to be very real within perception, and of which a synthesis, of idea and form, needs to be a key to relaunch classical methods from the ground up. There is no time, nothing is functional, all is decorative, and we are left with esthetic objects to choose from. This would solve the present day dead end of the new. Of which its own dogma, a hypnotics. Again, which no one can see without a proper evaluation, which is written here. What is implied is that we can understand esthetic and high esthetic and decorative value, also keen and dedicated to the values of nature, is only solid through its artisan process, whereas this then involves the meadow and windmill etc a ritual of life now, deu to its opposite, technology, in which every idea excludes form as kitsh, exludes nature as kitsh, and is an ever more technological and abstract consideration, with its perpetual criticism, out of which no one today seems to escape. Except the underground. Also something of which we see significant problems, to keep your words coherent in a world of babble and no cohesive forms offered, up to the problems with the ecology which can not simply sustain an infinate growth of subjects, here we must speak of composition. And also we need to consider spacetravel, as the structure was never about sustainable development, but about expanding and reaching a new level of conquest. We can no longer say we have boats just to row as leasure, we have boats to discover and populate the islands. So our technology also is not just leasure and to be wasted, it is to be used within a solid composition, of which knows a balance. This all is found outside the subject. What i'm claiming is that all within the critical argument, is currently and in all kinds of variations debating a sect of immanuel Kant, where as subjects they can't find a consensus on esthetics, they seek refuge into technology as minimalism, of which technology and science is its main binding and answer. Hence people live in what could be considered alien spaceships, and onwards in this manifest we will claim it has indeed a whole lot more to do with it, as a balance says, we needed to use a lot more of that technology to go beyond, and that balance says, we needed to, for instance we can presume, make that mistake, to reassess, and throw thousands of miles further. (Unleash an unparralleled leap both forward into space as back into more classic esthetics.) A natural evolution of the structure is then described. With the kitsh being and the conceptual being. Also convincing the mainstream to take the kitsh in account, and satisfying the madness and schizophrenia of "the speculative", in which it was trapped, and in which it is fed pills agains its will in psychiatries, the minute you claim a speculative thought. Or a passion in your behavior. As everything is subjective the majority is the average, so the average can be a subject, but anything else needs to be drugged for science sake, as its assumed its some kind of abberation. Everything also needs to be labelled, certified, adopted in a bureaucracy, there is no verse in words, people make these dumb analysis. Finally we would n't know why considering its all just fluids in your brain would n't be another illusion. As we can't say this deconstructive method this idealistic system of Kant does n't lead to nothingness as a new deity, and does n't lead to nothing as the only allegory. Or one of the very few. We need to free this worlds surpassed national stakes and national and conservative streaks, trade it off for sculptures of ecology and nature. A death of the oceans, with three sirens to represent the oceans dying as the grand opus magnum of this age. And what is then subjective? We claim the world exists, ready to be analyzed now, in what it contains, churches, temples, garbage, technology. And what the balance of it should be. The artists exist, its not subjective, they used to craft on palaces, find ways to meet eachother, now dispersed an audience still reading classical books etc, an audience watching things in museums, to which no one but the conservative media speaks to. And We can not intervene, those artists with the skill and sensibility to do that today, we have been left without media. As it is. All not very relevant anymore if we do it today. It is after all. Fake, kitsh, yes. Exactly. Show me how detached you are from nature and I will show you. That there is a lot MORE to that claim you make then you had considered. Rather then claiming what would be a weak stance that "classical art still has a value to do it today" which would looze from the "newists" I'm actually doubling down and am saying we actually LIVE in a classical world, and there was never so much new rather then the consesus of subjectivity, deletion of the human body central, and the fascistoization of myth and classic serenity. We have resolved in calling modernism... solipsism. This manifest is about the only thing modern you will find today. Rather then the social preoccupation of having to, "live" in an "age" i'm saying cosplay and subjectivity is in its turn deleting the concept of age. Therefore we now can see, “modernism” does n’t exist. By means of its convention if we describe it all we consider this era, the solipsist era, just like they called the impressionists impressionists. If everything is pluralism but bound again by the consensus of a incapacity to pronounce beauty, then it is solipsism, Roman era were modern, Greek were modern, even Egypt was modern. The notion to get stuck in the word and something would be beautiful and thus, not modern, and grotesque, and thus to conclude, that subculture is faulty and perverse. We are hence free to live in any age we want, embrace any esthetics we want, consider any artisan technique as an ANSWER to modernism. Not only that. deu to technology realizing nihilism, we have no other choice then make our own age, to tie to those myths and stories and write those stories and myths to tie us to nature and esthetics. To actually, create an artwork, and walk into it, is the only solace we can find. Then we can see we have developed from an art for art sake to an, quite on the contrary then, an... “Art we walk into in refuge for nihilism and technological and subject abstraction.” An art for lifes sake. An art to have a new friction, outside of just sitting in our cold empty cell being fed pulp. This is entirely befit a new esthetics and theory, befit for our Godlike responsabilities, to grow flowers and trees on Moon and Mars, very soon. In the subjectivity people argue if people want a closet give them a closet, all we can do is provide them one, we do not know anything else. What i'm saying now is people don't actually need a closet, this is just an illusion, people are apart of a natural composition. And its quite essential if you want to detox from the economy and the mass hysteria. Last but not least, then we dwell into the notion, what DO we need, we do indeed need to apologize to the oceans and restore the Acropolis with a Neptune for our devestation of the oceans in the name of the subject, a notion that the subjects did n't even need to consider as everything was just "subjective" and hey "don't you eat fish too hahh?" We indeed need to build a Zeus for the skies, etc. We indeed need a Rivendell for the serene elves living on this earth somewhere, as there is nothing else to do? They have their clothes for sure, some are marching through the streets in full armor, how long should they be part of fiction? When will spirituality be realized then? Some others have clothes and are fine with doing dishes and washing potatoes in an ordinary household setting in the matrix, some don't have clothes and rather stay anonymous for now but would love another then a common household setting and living in this matrix. We stack cages now for subjects, this is all we can do under the past 200 year theory. Now i'm asking? Does anyone still hold it for possible to the surrealists demand, not to rot away in ordinary bourgois "reality" but to develop a society based on surreal principles? What I have derived as a philosophy from the various features of modernism leads to an uprisal as a next step of emancipation of esthetics underneath, a revolution as well as an evolution. One leads to the other. As it was natural for all the skyscrapers to be established, it is entirely natural to get the elves, vampires (goths) and emo, angel, as any other esthetic out of this "hive", and reassert classical composition for them. Preferably with sustainable gardens, smaller sized windmills for artisan small dosages of energies, or for gardens underneath the supermarkets, and on top, etc etc. To break down the suburbs and have art deco and art nouveau palaces. We start with one angel, that can hopefully guard me against the general populace already fuming and throtting at the mouth, hating me for this theory. one Joan of Arc, and i'm already happy to find her, I can die with HER. Then we can grow from there. And we can see to our immortality. Physical may be as yet. Or at least, in literature, as that was deemed, "entirely too futile", "owhhh classical spirits, we need something new, those people will never again have an insight valuable to us " I'm afraid they are very wrong then.

DEDICATION
"To The begilded morbid bliss of the mists around the gallows" A vampire - angel hybrid to which i am endeaded to have me an embrace of mutual support and respect, an embrace that in this world was so rare and hard to find. And in which I am if I should have a soul not just for life, but am eternally endeaded, if this age may have given me, where it had only rotten souls left, gave me still a companion."
BARONESSE Gilded Bliss that is.
"To look sad, and to be normal, unaristocratic, an ape, a modern person, a person who watches fiction and games all day, sitting in a matrix cage, that is the worst possible outcome, not just for you but for the architecture, for Time itself!!! Yes, in any given case, the Jung Archetypes, which they were, gave us a chance to believe in Vampires, Angels, Elves, yes, WE are all that, WE are aristocrats, living our useless and passionate life, full of wonder. and in that they are no longer archetypes but Arch Symbols, where we do not, just sit by and relax, but solidify everything TOWARDS the classics as much or anything we can find. For that we can establish architecture and Art. And to believe it MORE so, that it is MORE powerfull and MORE beautiful then fiction. That all is mandatory and self evident."

"If opposed to all the showmanship, in media would now be simply asked, where is a classic architect? Where is an artist in despair who could decorate this otherwise empty building? Where is there a Joan Of Arc somewhere in a psychiatry today? Where is there for that a Goethe or a Holderlin or a Baudelaire or or. Or a Schopenhauer. But you do not know those people, you can not understand those people, and in all your technical details on how to produce the subject crap you been producing for a hundred years, you don't really care to answer with a significant a letter a produce of your own. Hence this site will find them, and place a philosophy for them to maintain their minds in this age. And even, gather them all the armies if chances would exist the spoiled children of humans might have a few more problems then they figured. It is for the simple reason that Kant and Hegel as Schopenhauer etc have all gone on a main thread that they created modern society. FOR THE TIME BEING, and i repeat; FOR THE TIME BEING, i will not indulge in the acceptence of a lack of constructive debate and scolding towards us. We do not need it. We don't understand why you would not constructively debate a philosopher and a movement who got you into the mess, and not accept some problems and solution with a 200 year old philosophy which everyone was so eager to accept. These solutions MAY, I said, MAY to SOME appear as psychotic or derived from a schizoid asshole, but that does not mean they are to EVERYONE psychotic or derived from a schizoid asshole. To some they might not even be terribly insignificant, as yet may be even discomfortingly amusing to shed so much light on the modern psyche and esthetic and fiction of a reality in which we find ourselves living in at present moment. That I have indulged here in so much depravity dispite the intelligence of some claims, does n't matter so much to the already constructive mind EITHER, that i have failed to write them out if at all possible i deeply apologize as it would n't be more mainstream as the ideals and problems proposed obviously deserve, however living with a mind that discards belief every twenty seconds and still come up with something in this age and especially with the lack of nobility of the conversation these days surely left some distracting and entirely corrupt remarks here and there. I know of more corruption penned down in past ages then you can phathom in your entire civil rights decorum. And they have liberated and freed and helped MORE people then your entire civil rights decorum today TOO. Of which is merely the limitation of mass gullability, dictators religions or democracy, we were always fighting the same people, as we do so again this whenst. So WHY NOT, if the eyes of the media shine on you, simply, and already in advance, ask for a few, gorgeous battle angels, to battle the old babbling hags left of the democracy!!"
""All the cliche's on which modern society lives are faulty, and distilled out of a moral flatulance. A fart of a man breeds here, who knows only the most deplorable of times, and nothing of the grandest feats of the past times, let me then become shit, and let only light come from my shit. Let it reflect upon my abominable being then, and give you a perfume you can't deny. You wanted filth. Well i have a terrible ending for you. You wanted it, here it is, and to those who were armed in character and wisdom, i have a terrible beauty here too. I have no doubt, those who are shit, will take shit, and smear it all over their mouths, and spew it at me in their rage and despair, as they were always in history the rage and despair, naked now, and those who are terribly smart, will take this to more action then currently the mainstream considers it worthy of. You can be shit in your garage right? Well this piece of shit is not taking it anymore."
People are obsessed with the past, its beauty and nature, and other people are obsessed with the future or futurism itself. I say let them, lets get these subjectivity and marxism and conservativism down the toilet. And this all babble stacked in some modern office now. And sort out the mess, which I mean to state here, that millions need to go to space ASAP, and millions need to be stacked in classical architecture. Therefore of ESTHETICS we can say a whole lot, since we have to DO it, of ETHICS will amount to just babble, since everyone will do what they want anyway. And if we indeed look at it that way, as I state here gardens will have to be put in cellars and on roof tops, entire landscapes will have to be made, trees on MArs will have to be planted, yes a planet architecture will have to be created with some more Idylle, rather then another prison system eating cheap lasagna. What that philosophy should look like, and how the flaws in modern philosophy are best battled, is as far as i know the job of a philosopher. I was recognized that some time ago. We mean to integrate only religion with myth, myth with imagination, the artisan with the notion of entertainment, artisan notions embedded in things now only considered as industrial applications, or refuted by science, yes positivism itself is the object of our scepcis here. When we are at the beginning, there is no reliance on past merit, we are the ancestors of ourselves, over thousands of years, and we are the ancestors of ourselves, in a thousand years to come. For that there can not be the present complacancy and illusion of retirement. The past needs to come to life, the modern vacuosity needs to be filled, and for that the past needs to be no sterile entity, no virus into a sealed cannister kept away like it will kill us all.

Light for Beauty, Darkness for Civilization."

"Meanwhile I can only hope for a better world, where metal bands, youth as much or at least its prowess dedication and agility, opposed to this "civil democracy" give free concerts juxtaposed directly OPPOSED to democratic mainstream buildings like city halls and etc and not be in meadows anymore, dates to be anounced as soon as possible then, first bands and REAL legions then will be laurelled. I can only hope for a better world when EVERY black metal and for that matter METAL band, makes a communist martial industrial album and a fascist martial industrial album. Just to balance it out and an up yours to society. (launching bands to be announced) The artists and the wise were always the martyrs of their societies, up to us now to pin them down on their present day mass hysteria on their futile triviality and surpassed dogma's left of the debate."

I'm for communist economics, but what identity and art does it have? Especially now? We can see the subject lacks hands, ears, eyes, boobs, color, (so beautiful as colors are, would one live in a world where all artists have to be color blind? Surely the perspective to one being unique to be colorblind is absurd to urge all the people who see colors to attend to the same uniqueness, maybe we are just not all that unique?) So marxists say you can't paint your face black? and Black men can't paint their face white? So we reached the opposite of hitler, all modernist and minimalist art, ergonomics and functionality is true? All history is degenerate? All myths? All classical authors? All classical depiction? As atheism, when are Marxists going to create their own culture and not be parasites on the classical? Can you even do that? Whats an atheist without God? What is a communist, or a modernist for that matter, without classical crimes? Parasites?! do you see the problem? The prosecution of arts and symbols is a witchhunt, i delight in any decorative notion. But to the communists it was once the decadents and the avant garde and the surrealists, who can't be entertained anymore (even if the surrealists created most of these surreal modern species without decorum and a hysterical reflex on anything you would say, i'm claiming these people are religious) to modern mainstream and this moral highground the media has, and in which they abort any notion of beauty, its like owwwwh, you are embracing some fascist depiction?! Now EVERY decorative beauty has been deemed fascist.

"Did you ever notice how easy it is to get along with someone? Who is n't despaired and ill informed on modern theory? How someone who read books and is also an autonomous mind, is always a friend and you never met at random, but is rather living at the bottom? Lost among trolls and bitches? Well here is a place for noblemen and intelligence who are all at one united in arts."
"Simplicity is distinct in purity. Simple minds that make excuses or otherwise never encourage beauty and intelligence in stead of wonder and value a temporary and miserable as very much a thing as "today" with very simple solutions over an infinate and bright future are the rotting of that day and that future." People that have now "found" it are the lost ones. By that i mean the "everything just has to be cheap now" are the ones to build it. Their "democratic" voices are heard. It is the solemn individual, the outsider, who wants something to be "personal" and not part of the hive mind. This hive mind that, and of which citizens just tolerate; the hive, and considers all others part of the masses and not himself. This is the time of the empty "Subject". That should or could be a paradox, if i'm not as a matter of fact not doing other then produce ideals and instigate to mass minds how it should be, and they consider "they" won't understand. "everything, just has to be cheap" well i'm sorry as much as religion goes if you do not resist it any futile and careless notion is still apart of that religion. "ahh well we just have to listen to christianity" "thats just how it is today" does n't really work does it? Well it can be noted that artists ONCE had a job and now no more, so society does indeed change, so does idealism. Society is destroying itself and they go "yes it is destroying itself". So yes at some point you need to walk out, and point your finger somewhere, and then they will go. Thats what subjectivity PROVES.

"If one is eager to learn, and able to find information, one never needs to be a subject, one can grow into a personality. Confirmed with the visual and visionary. The Subject is the womb, the civil is the offspring of the masses, the Personality opposed to the subject, is what defies the masses through originality and lack of compliance, subjectivity is for sheep to make their own claim anonymous as they would be, the old Christian sermon became repeated once again and in subjectivity it is hollow, personality is what is filled and resents the status quo. As such we can say, there are two subjectivities, one that Kant created and talks about subjectivity, and one that mythology or religion creates and allows various opinions on the same imagery. Now we have come to the notion of beauty and imagination being affirmed only in serenity, and serenity being an esthetic quality, and a quality of art which is in effect its religious nature. This does n’t allow for enterainment or advertising to prime, as it is simply a despair growing. Apart from that subjectivity is making the whole society hollow, and is making people soulless, as they could n't be bothered to educate themselves, wonder, considering they have no detrimental schewed sceam to be told of. It is a pitty, but these peoples faiths, what they are, is cackling skelletons, they mean to us as much as a dumb bird would just be tweeting, but we don't wonder about them, we don't admire them, they don't have wings, they don't have majesty or magick, they are very dumb ugly and soulles beings. And they are everywhere!!! They can't be understood even so much to be disgusted rather then pittied, but their sheer size and vanity, makes for a profound enemy and detriment to beauty and artistic and aristocratic discourse.

"politics has n't become status quo, the media have become status quo, no provocation is allowed, everything is nice and neatly tucked away in the underground, you can do in your garage what you want little piece of snot, we have our world that was never evolved out of the classics, and never evolves into the classics again. well to that person i have to offer a theory here of supreme difficulty, which it won't understand, only the precursors of a new world understand, and the students of the previous worlds, and to find them i must go to a thousand upon thousands the furthest underneath,...
And opposed to them;
The ones to hold this place for the most obvious reality, and sit now in the bars in which the artists and philsophers once sat, and travel to places artists and kings would once have travelled to. I'm afraid you have responsabilities undreamed of, and all the system does is to suffice you, you have a leadership with unparamounted challanges, and the very fact of politicians getting elected, is to deny any responsability for the explosion of the weight of society over the next hundred years on a finite planet, because you just want to be more sufficed, and that is why you elect politicians? To devour the earth?? And this is what exactly? Democracy? And all your complaints about taxes and how little you have and how you are unsatisfied with the customer service is what? The worthwhile democratic dialogue and discourse going on? Your commercial propaganda is your literature? Again, the philosophers said, it was all subjective, you just needed to be sufficed, i'm afraid your concept of that leadership then and authority, the very authority of the subject, is going to be under serious strain."

"Because one thing no one reckoned, but The Third Reich was a temporary decor, so too Modernism is a mass movement, and mass movements are a hype, an idea, its born from books and destroyed by books. And so too it is temporary." It depletes itself, as soon as the hype of the idea is over it can't perpetuate itself, it has no merit in its own right, it thrives on surpassed brilliance, that shone once bright and made thousands disciples, but followers, masses can never breath life into the imagination, that is duty of such book and society authors, But the accents were all placed wrong. And again, distopias can be written, but they are just unsuccessfull utopias, you will always write society. An ideal as much as a criticism will eventually become the society.


...and the TREATIZE on the Subjectivity transferred into matter.
or the Subjectitato materia Quam.


As I write the so manieth introduction. And this is, at long last what will be held to light first by me. To speak to those mysterious lurking with me underground. Let me say nice to meet you. And then, that we know people do not know life, that modern life is a lie. When we read the older books of rotten paper and rotting sentences, we know that modern people do not know how to speak. You and me, we read these books, they don't know, so many times i ranted and gave them hundreds of topics, and have yet to receive a single answer. This has driven me insane frequently. These people are deaf dumb and mute. Willingly. Or because they have been fed nothing but analytical books. Without oration of the classical past. -we consider the oratory qualities of Latin language for instance "pushing" opposed to the analytical qualities of English today making a carton box out of the past, hence also making icons of feats, and also deviate ever onwards from the oration prowess towards more casual Esprit, to Humour, to Modern "irony" of discourse, where nothing which is said can hold up to make sense.- This is like, a contestation to a worth, of which i choose to side, yes, to meet finally those eminent and friendly intelligent underneath, whereas our media had been stolen, and whereas this time becomes a distant light sinking like a sun at a horizon. At the other side, now dark, so dark, is history... That our media has been stolen I will frequently repeat this crime of arrogance of stupidity. These words may be an indication why we can remain, readress the past, and also be an introduction to those who have never been aqcuinted with these books. It is a readressing of the stilness, wading out of the turbulant waters where hopefully this stillness will remain here as it was offered by the Machine. And craft, out of this nothingness, some bond where which we may find a movement, a last assault perhaps. A rekindling of the classical and elegance in movements and art. We must appeal, yes, hold those rites to call a sun ourselves, without us she will not appear once more from that dark side, where history lay. They offered a crisis and offered oblivion to people unfilfilled, now we must find calmth and meaning somwhere, among the Rubble. It is, even contrary to what you would think, an attempt to suddenly turn on the light of twelve noon. In one blunt move we reach to the center of day. Read on then you who see a promise in that. The first layer of spirituality opposed to the "mainstream capitalist and modernist attitude" As delivered in the manifest i wrote for the Ayris Machine. "As we will see here, we'll encounter rather then everything as subjective, we encounter on the contrary the problem of the subjectivity itself, how we started to look at history from the outside, and made a culture out of that, furthermore then we need to investigate science and the speculative, the imagination, intuition, ritual, and hence the kitsh opposed to the modern conceptual, analytical and the world of "ideas" and also the virtual opposed to the natural. If eating hamburgers spouting out of factories and never a cow and sky and grass was apart of that we need to speak of poetry. And also for esthetics, if an industrial sculpture or an industrial book is spouting out everywhere and there is no sense or worth in that, we go to esthetics beauty and the artisan, of which many are now criticizing or doubting the worth of society, but no one is formulating this systematically. And no effort other then deconstruction was undertaken since Immanuel Kant. The rest devolved or went underground into the occult or kitsh, but this as a counter movement or some astronomy of little importance can not be maintained, if all the speculative needs to become fiction, then there will be no species in the future but meat balls being fed sugar in bowls, we AND the cows will become that for that matter. There is? SOMETHING ELSE!!"
Why not, rather then conceptualize into more ideas, would you not conceptualize beauty? A fractal in a nihilist machine. Why not have pagan markets in galleries, entirely classic and well crafted. And sell vegetables? But owh. We are selling art there, we are the treu ancestors of Duchamp, i’m afraid they are the same bourgois they ever were. Standing there without much significance. Where we talk about the structure then there seems nothing other to it rather then to suffice, into a stationary reality, it is on the contrary expanding, hence we need to consider it expanding into space and yes, discuss space travel, also a very kitshy field. None the less, if the structure is clearly expanding from the beginning onwards and there is not just some "overpopulation" but the organic within a society was doing that all along, then we need to see a system, a pattern in the misuse of resources currently for an excess of game stations flatscreens, and yes, entire stadiums and train stations that better had been used on Mars Moon etc for electronics for spaceships and biospheres. At long last then we will also conclude if you stroll in a forest you have no concept of time there, if you see a pristine Greek acropolis, this notion we can't "do what they did" is a dogma that made this time, and is entirely faulty, and we will then have to conclude out of that, that time does entirely NOT exist! In essence cosplaying is more right then the shirt and tie. They don't look as stupid, when we are what they were, and when "we" would be looking back at, "us". We would dare to argue that a King or Queen would have done better then a democracy, -we argue they, the democracy, with the democratic leasure system, would have mounted ships on beams swinging the masses back and forth and the Americas would have never been discovered- particularly when it was set under the light of this "subject" for 200 years. Schopenhauer Hegel Marx on to Huysmans TS Eliot and Samael becket, towards the existentialists. We can say that idealism came to rest, and finally if you have no identification or spirit apart from history, beauty or exaltation of religion you will see the people loiter and on a vacation, and in turn waste more resources on leasure, then these modern authors wonder what is the point and why and simply THAT there is no meaning? And if you turn on the sun you are not an individualist, yes to be an individualist you MUST subscribe to this crisis of subjectivity. Which then is an empty subject WITHOUT an object. This manifest would state that on the contrary the essence of the object and its esthetics fills and is the reason of the subject??? The thread ended in Foucault. The more original and gradually evolving opinions that led to this manifest are from letters in Dutch to the academy of Antwerp which of course should be translated and available as soon as possible.
so ergo
Why don't you NOT eat two pieces of fruit a day shipped from all over the fucking planet what are you fucking crazy? Why don't you NOT eat three meals a day of delicious supermarket food. Why don't you NOT go to the fitness center, why don't you NOT get sports goods and goods for anything but painting profound classical paintings what are you fucking crazy??? Why don't you NOT job and jog and bike around and build a castle in stead and maybe you don't need to go see the tai Mahal, eat industrial soup in India shipped from fricking PAKISTAN, and why don't you NOT buy industrial copies for your front door. BUILD ONE TAJ MAHAL OF YOURSELF. And having said that. Why don't you NOT go to the do it yourself store for more degenerate crap SAME STANDARDS ON BEAUTY FOR ARCHITECTURE APPLY NOW SINCE THE STONE AGE, AND WHAT DOES YOUR PLANET LOOK LIKE? You want to grow into Duracel Batteries all of your own? Having enough insulation and carton board novelties and such? Why don't you NOT get space technology for leasure and movies, why don't you GET A COW TO A MEADOW. OR GROW SOME ROOTS, when space travel comes to get its dues and balance is restored, i'm afraid modern subject philosophy and marxism and kapitalism don't amount to much. IN the end nature will give you SOME ROOTS AND SOME BERRIES, and why don't you NOT shit in water but in a hole in a meadow, much more ecological TOO. Why don't you just STOP USING CARS? the world will be A BETTER PLACE. And FIFTY PERCENT OF THAT COMPOSITION OF ALL YOUR CARS? IS SPACETRAVEL TOO. Why the FUCK did you think you were STUCK in the first place, ALL In life is balance, and your subject being some kind of king customer was just AN OLD WIVES TALE FROM A PHILOSOPHER ONE DAY, WELL ONE NEW PHILOSOPHER HAS JUST PROVEN, ITS OVER.
Feel time and the classics seep back in now? HISTORY IS DYING, and the FUTURE is growing. I NEVER needed much. YOU did n't either, THAT was just a RELIGION!!

FIRST ON OUR PLATE
DECONSTRUCTING DECONSTRUCTION
Culture is in decay, futility interest is promoted everywhere. "About what you can not speak, be silent of it" Yes, and leave everyone to loiter, decapitate intelligent esthetic discourse? "Time will always be the same, best to redraw in arts and releave yourself from the will to compete in society." (Schopenhauer) Yes, and that world, that thought, created a reaction, a hysteria, (Nietzsche) and then created concentration camps. (Latest of my finds could contest that but at least this consideration was growing, the notion of a dark satanic ruthlessness of sorts, the cynicism over the masses.) It created Becket, it created nothing anyone could do anything with, we detached, none is rendered usefull to these people... To say nothing is to leave the masses despaired, and we have not seen them as despaired as by this thread of 200 years of philosophy and art. We could not be more displeased with how the twentieth century "defended" classical culture against the masses, they failed.
The mainstream is full of deconstructive arguments, in effect they exist these arguments because the language of form is gone, lost. This leads to debate about trivialities. There is a thread in modern art academies where they state that "if it is good" you "can't say anything about it". No in effect what has been done before 1940 all that "stuff" did n't mean people did n't speak. What rises up now is the deconstructive, the thing that creates polarization. The provocative, the hysteria and despair. Besides i'm sorry to say, the good and quality esthetic sculptures you could easily pick out from the majority, we only need to be a little bit fair here. when people gleefully gaze at sculptures and cringe of seeing them, and then on the other hand sort of all stand in line for another sculptor to model for him or her, because there are talents, we need n’t remain treu to the subject just to defend the meager and mediocre results, of course, in equality, for the structure any expression needs to have the same ETHICS, pluralism needed to respect anything naive, there was a sympathy, which means anyones creativity is as free and worthwhile as a childs, but you can't say anything about THAT as a moral prohibition. It does n't have the same ESTHETICS, clearly. And which means everything is still left unsaid, now suddenly we have to respect peoples tastes when they live in a world where the present is dead much as history is dead, and where form is dead.
Opinionation leads to deconstructive arguments, where you can explain a philosophy and people will throw it away out of the order of the opinion, while needing no philosophy to come up with for themselves. Unfortunatly philosophy and solid argumentation built societies, opinions are lost in the society and lead to no progress, if there is no solid philosophy we will never escape the age. There is only the opinion in itself, in essence what everyone jumped onto. I welcome any philosophy to be developed. Jung, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Bergson. Any. But please do it better and more decisive and formulate something away from the Kantian Paradox. Namely that if you tell people to "think for themselves" all they will say is "lets think for ourselves." there will not come a single thought of that but despair. If you say everything is "subjective" no one will become a solid subject growing. They will simply become powerless subjects. they will say "everything is subjective" they will not be able to hold a dialogue on that. In effect for a dialogue to be formed also then the language needs to be formalized as was stated. So that is what we have left. Incapable to formulate a taste, a worth, unless commerce, tells them, in a culture that hollows out, and no one with a reply to that. They remain subjects. How could you argeu they are not subjects? In fact they are not, its a fractal, if you tell them, they will become that. if you lift them out. They will become whole. Societies don't exist with seven billion opinions all living their own exclusive reality. You have cathedral builders and stone masons, for reason this is the same. But you will have to have the nerve to state the meaning, for 200 years they built a philosophy out of dismantling a church, little did they know and expect this would be the end result. Cages and Empty theaters, fiction and hysteria. The energy was spilled combating christian religious dogma, and they lost the beauty of the imagination. Basically by making a secular state the capitalist system became the only religion which oozes its despaired and rediculous deities out every day on people. The prowess and dilligence to resist, persist is gone, in fact weakness is preferred as that makes you needy, any advertisement is there to make you depressed and make everything rediculous, only the product stands out, this too as a part of deconstructivism. There is a whole of reality which we mean to debate. Anyone already understanding of that is the FIRST ideal and audience to who'm this manifest speaks. The ones to be on the verge of despair, ready to cave in, starving and gutted by every word of this society. The legions ready to storm it. To analyze this society without criticizing the pascifying subject object problem all this thousands of times with people who don't understand philosophy is tiresome and in all not very good for ones mental health. If you state that it is subjective or an opinion you are classifying the other as a degenerated notion of a defunct God. Subject replaced God, subject is under the object so the object grows on automatic pilot left to banks and commercial interests and what may. Then an esthetic philosophy must become diabolical through its cynicism, -the romantic and decadent cynicism, which is hard to abandone I admit- and an ergonomic philosophy must endow the vast majority into the abyss of several flaws within ergonomics as we may consider. Being the fact that we labour to annihilate a sensory life, which RELIGION also in one fell swoop annihilates ecological life as no christian or passed generation would have tolerated, not because the generations are different, but because the RELIGION is different. Industrialization is merely taking away the artisan self reliance of regions and persons to an amorph reality of individualism. Here we prefer an empress of an ecological as esthetical powerstructure, surrounded by a court of artists and intelligence. Rather then all be whining plebeians it would be befit to solidify everyones personal opinion not blow it away, or grow a distance to it. This as a matter of deconstruction does n't help the fifty year discourse of deconstruction to be broken in its turn. We get the choice of a construction in a world that is highly deconstructivist and which has to be overcome. May you be reminded, opinion and deconstruction inevitably leads to solipsism, solipsism will have you write a book about protagonists killing eachother off to find a book, that will eventually be burnt by their dead bodies, a book that you would never publish. Thats an allegory of what is waiting for you if you do not trod on an esthetic and imagination theory more solid. They did have an opinion in the middle ages, in the Romantic era, in any era, they did have an economy in any era as well. Here we talk about culture, not opinions. The ones who speak of an opinion are the powerless and lost today, trying to unleash insanity upon all that have one intelligent thought with their repetitive lack of content and defend the whole culture behind them. The blatant "opinion" itself, along with its ill founded and ill argumented subjectivity, or those opinions bestowed with little of the pathos of history and having no merit.
We speak to an audience no one speaks to. We who know some of the past 200 years of philosophy and art have a very different view then the uneducated. They boost opinions while you try to give them arguments on how the culture evolved, try to educate them and all becomes an opinion. "Of beauty we can not speak" The taste of beauty is without objection to the individual." And what should come from that communication exactly?? Well they have been bred, by the philosophers saying nothing much at all. Then this becomes a loop. Whereas it has to be about the opinion, the actual effective opinion does not matter, where it is an actual opinion then, we have to see it paralyzed or in effect not considering the main thread. So many imagination now is imagination within imagination, analysis upon analysis, time within time. We can gather here and breed the future. All future derives from books, and here we are determined to write those books. Immanuel Kant wrote a book. People started living it, for better and a for a lot of things, worse, we mean to intervene. As someone who is wiser, you can go insane if someone says you have an opinion, and tries to take it from you to educate them in some reversal of 200 year history. Or you can get angry. To get very angry is the least problematic of both options, it is life. Insanity, where we have been, is hardly anything you would like to be. And to have opinions and the debilitation of the uneducated masses stampede right now is a dead end street, it will lead to romantics growing diabolical, as we have seen in Black Metal, this all is modernism, analyze it. The last free philosopher had finally concluded already, on the brink of the insanity, "regression". When you finally grow insane, you realize we need another world, we don't need this world filled with cages and opinions in cages. We may ask ourselves, why is n't there Art Nouveau, Baroque, Art Deco, etc, today, (If you are asked, "are you cosplaying" or when they refer to your work as classical "are you likened to classical architecture." etc, you could simply ask them in return if "they are cosplaying." If they "like this sect of modernism" I mean why on earth should there be this standard?! You can clearly see that it exists? So then why bother with this notion of subjectivity in the first place?! IF there was individualism, to some extent there is, but not really, under the "concept" the "seal of subjectivism" there exists a draught and cancerous conservativism. To draw these initiatives out of the underground is the purpose of this site. But mainly, to state that Immanuel Kant built the structure, is something not only that is hard to deny, as was stated, it also brings terrible consequences. Schopenhauer and his denounciation of the will to live brought us the concentration camps. If you are going to think big. You create a game of pool behind you. If you don't think, you do the same. Not saying anything or just being a subject also renders a world. So a silent person is as much part of a much bigger game. Of which these words and the affiliates of this site must be aware they are part of. But to let society without the study of the subject object problem to a positive resolution and a therapy for that problem will leave the most brilliant, the most sensitive, the despaired, suicidal, anorexic, etc, to be irradicated, and but the debilitated crowds run amok with their flacid opinions left and right. In fact then we leave them to an atheist commerce, an atheist entertainment. Of which we now know, that the serenity, of commerce and entertainment, is the only treu spirituality or divinity. It is not the religion, or that which is in line with religion of any kind. We can develop many features. But to have attacked religion itself as a concept, we have attacked the serene quality of the imagination. Kant misstated his problem as it were. It is not the object which is unknown, the object is, as the structuralists said, what you do with reason, reason is always within perception, so what you do with reason is structural, spirituality and the occult developed as alternatives to religion, in the underground, but the leftover objective society had left was an abstract commerce and entertainment, therefore the object was not unkown, a new object was created with that. Now this leaves the considerations of WIlliam Blake and Jean Delville and Jung, among others as vital, not as surpassed?! We need to write them BETTER, not discard them to be oblivious against modern society, modern society is a crisis why do these people defend? What to defend it WITH?? We need to paint the serenity within entertainment now before all collapses. Project ecology, esthetics, and the border of artisan goods linked to the perception of the person towards himself and his surroundings and environment, who are in fact linked by an artisan, perceptual bond. Objectification leads to minimalism and ergonomics to actually put the weight on the subject and reverse it "to have a world existing only before your eyes and what is in between your eyes and what you see." To live off the supermarket and consider life is futile while eating the earth away is not sheer hedonism, it is the destructive violance as an ideology, it is terribly naice even, contrary to its assumptions, therefore it is hypocritical, little do we know why such an ethics should bother them; But by any means this is the remnant, the lack of responsability as a religion, underneath all left and right debates. Whereas these people who NEVER take responsability are the majority. Then if you think there is a little bit of a problem there you are considered a fascist? Where does it state that judging subjects who so far only take from the earth and need not credit and respect the source is some kind of criminal? Again it is absurd when you are considered a fascist if Kant himself created a whole culture? Suddenly we would say. Don't listen to Kant Schopenhauer form an opinion. NOW? This is prevelant dispite that left and right is, and this was created through Kant. So here we do not mean to create a babble environment as any other site, but an engaged, emperial attitude for each. This will automatically subvert or render each and everyones belief in commerce and commercial advertising obsolete. And to those who remain uneducated and further grow the despair of a lack of serenity to compose the masses, it will be bombed by the fundamentalists of who'm this manifest is not shy to produce. If you can destroy a whole culture and ecology. You can be pretty sure there will be a war again, if you ever fought a war, then on to defend nature and culture would be one. This time, not a war of a nation, or an ideology. But the sheer war against commercial, degenerate, deconstructive, hysterical debilitation, as this society treats of: ANY religion will grow its fundamentalists, so will this concept of those ideas of antiquity and history. It is inevitable. But as I'm personally preoccupied to the despaired and suicidal, who are left with nothing but pills and unfounded solipsist "comforts" who leave more despair then any of these occupation philosophies solve, i'm sure there will be other branches, ready to irradicate or otherwise segregate the more brutal and cold members of society, of which we felt a great need ourselves sometimes, being left despaired and misunderstood. Sensitivity and the more boisturous arrogance, or the arrogance in despair of a genius, confronted by a time that is not his. Also all of them notions that immanuel Kant does n't consider I imagine, In fact he renders REASON useless, just circling in your own mind. He renders the language of form useless in effect, and that is what he did, and that is what we argue here, FORMS, ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE, PAINTING. (The option is there for a basics of philosophy based on any of those notions, why DOES it always have to be? SUBJECTIVITY? Because its a SECT?!)
We can conclude that serenity is attached to the esthetics of the imagination, the lack of belief in esthetics produces hysteria, which meanders into advertising and then gets absorbed likewise within mainstream fiction. You have analysis as far as any ideology is concerned but you do not have any fiction running at large where the threads are more or less projecting the actual reality. There is a duty in the artist to develop in between fiction and hysteria. As we can consider, why is the notion of utopic thoughts not considered, whereas why is there then nothing but distopics considered and distopics also engaged. Ideals mean some people get angry, sure, keep them at bay, don't consider worthwhile ideals useless, but for that you need to go back or transfer those ideals to a more generous or less conservative nature. Likewise a lot of progressive notions would n't hurt in reasserting the moral subversivity they started with.
An artist would also have the duty to compose in between concept or kitsh, the very outskirts of both, the technique and nuanciation of the classical, whereas the innovation and idea in itself certainly is n't as valuable as they think. Something artisan is always new, something conceptual can always be artisan developed and decorated, there is no extreme polarization needed. Of which progressives then had to claim, the artisan is the past, and the debate always created over most people liking the artisan, because perceptually bound item. The hysteria, over the serenity, becomes the "pluralist" debate in the newspapers and is "entirely healthy" yes it is "not boring" it is "entertaining". Whereas probably when they call romantics or symbolists "monsters" in the newspapers, we would not be surprised if this is a measure of hysteria too, in effect they fume over the protection of this precious opinion, while they have n't got a cleu what that would be. Get it in the newspapers, fits the agenda entirely. Well it does fit the agenda of black metal to take it a few steps further. How much further exactly does the nonsense of newspapers need to go? The swords are aimed at you remember?
Beauty of classical merit is now dorment in all these hives underneath. TIme to bring it out!! These are the antidotes to commercial nihilism, foundations of a faith in serenity, even in this age, you don't wonder how conceptual art comes about in this age but how THEY had preserved their skill is a serious mystery.
Polarization with the mainstream will grow more mainstream. Likewise if the rich want to keep their wealth, something they increasingly want to guard through violance, because they have no ideology? How could they have an ideology? They are considered subjects all the same. They don't know the object either?! And this carrot they all are chasing?! They are not considered composers and money is not "to compose" it is to hoard. The lack of ideals "to compose" means they have to buy deconstructivist art, over a simple artisan project. (We consider subjectivity leads to the poorer subjects to state "all is about money" and the richer to go "well there is no point in composing all is just subjective so my numbers count and i need to stack up on numbers on my bank account") Postponing the general well being of the planet and an artisan economy which they can lead is not exactly postponing the point where the poor take all the rich their money. It serves absolutely no purpose? I mean you purchase a stock, subsequently this stock will drive you yourself insane with the despair of commercial advertising today. Its not exactly Christianity is it? Or is it? Well Christianity did n't exactly go away with a single strike its not going to go away this monster by saying it is my individual opinion TO THINK. In effect, Kant said, all reality is in our head, and made that world over a length of twohundred years, radically opposed to that we can say. Reality is what is in front of our eyes, up against the wall of perception. And if we think that, we see the world that he created, it is white, empty, filled with primary colors. Filled with suits, slick patrons of ergonomics.
Ideals and dreams are lost, time for the artists to develop a whole new world, that the masses and politicians and tourists and businessman can not escape.
Once we setup a world that works. On this machine, virtually. The world that fails has been overcome and will be history forever. In effect democracy did n't exist untill this machine WORKS.
The bourgois at least had a "secret charm" what the later modernists and their plebeian hysteria irony and nihilism have is unsure, but its not charming at all.
So deconstructing deconstructivism essentially comes down to, what we could consider to look where the weight falls when something is said. To construct we can always see that to construct must come in the first place when reason is practiced since reason itself is only means and is even unverifiable in itself. Science and reason therefore both are means, maybe science can easily define reasonability as atheitistic but as the end result, it is merely in the crystalization of what reason is, appearing as a product of serenity of artists or opposed to the irony within fiction. The end result becomes entirely "religious" again no matter what you choose. Religious is almost the definition of nature and matter ITSELF, let alone what the crystalizations of reason concerns.
What is repeated throughout here is the first work Kant wrote "All the planets of all the stars are inhabited and the best men live furthest away from the Earth." So where is the weight? He basically transformed God. Turned it into aliens. A spiritual preference of the universe that has ultimatly created mankind and is consenting to it, that it is preferred over that very mankind here to exist. "You can not speak of." So we do not speak rather but speak, we do not construct then, the gravity of reason is not utilized to its maximum, therefore it is faulty. Reason is only so futile, that considering religion created 2000 years of churches. We consider religion more treu then science. What does science create? Not ball rooms in space exactly. Perpetual in itself revolving tests without a log of gold being ever gotten from Mars or Moon, Science itself is archeologic mainstream, it relies on the anonymous masses and feeds them, considering it will prove as the solution to the dialectic problem. It can not think of ideals, since the politicians can't think of it either, stuck in the archeology and concept, the artists and philsophers must think it, free of 200 year debates; THey even wonder if man should ever be on Mars. Do you think anyone before the nineteenth century would even concider a stupidity like that? WE exist, and DESERTS are what we fertilize. THAT IS ALL we can apply reason for. THAT IS ALL we HAVE to apply reason for. Man should not go to America, well we heard those voices, and there certainly seems to have been points made by it. None the less deserts can not be killed, NOW you consider let us REST. I consider NATURE and the whole essence of structure and its development is against you?? Its all clogging up?! You are sitting in a traffic jam spanning a whole earth and then wonder why so much resources and technology should be used for space travel? DO YOU NEED SOME EXTRA CARS TO PILOT AUTOMATICALLY BEFORE AND BEHIND YOU YOU NEED TO TAKE SOME MORE SPACE AND EXPAND THE PRINCIPLES OF YOU A BIT??
Christ said, "I am the son of something more powerfull beyond the skies." that at least is in summary the thought, of which was later contested, by Spinzo and Kant and their influence (hence they are prophets) mainly and for which we have inherited decay, (hence being objectively prophets of decay, no matter how sympathetic I am to them.) and for which MUST be found a coherent spiritual reply, not just a black metal revolt, not just a snobbish disdain. One must first of all offer wealth to those who would have you taste with great content any droplet of nurture on which they would feed so profoundly, and consider a manner in which they act spoiled and where this person becomes sick not a very plausable nurishment. Yes if it defends mankind as a ghetto, perhaps you had language, but did not give anyone language, or the substance of the language which was the 60 percent of beauty normally apart of culture. In any case the detriment with which society feeds and down trods on the 60 percent spiritual devise of a culture leaving less then zero of it, it is entirely the purpose of philosophy, or of a profound philosopher, to nurish and entice any spiritual belief of the ones swept under the rug of ergonomics and minimalism and conceptualism, if it is not beautiful for no one, how can it be subjectively beautiful? And if it is subjectively beautiful? How can it be beautiful to anyone? And that was left to grey people, and left us with no one generous enough to take that beauty and lift it up?!
Is there really not something more powerfull then (for) what can be achieved (in) art? Or is there really nothing within art so powerfull? No art has to be "for art" This is absurd?! THIS is a logical phallacy. Again Camus saying "suicide is the only philosophical problem is a logical phallacy." NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND? "What to build cathedrals for is the only philosophical question." it should be a question as there is no dogma to institute. Or the merit in Kant, but unfortanatly also the demise of society. And clearly what artists should be protected for against societies. That there is something beyond speaks for itself anyone, that you can reflect it within and without is the core of art ANYWAY!! That religion can only meander out and through the beauty of art and has its place all over society is ABSOLUTELY treu. It is now on the contrary deu to capitalism the REVERSED, it is religion and its beauty as beauty itself of the mostly atheistic or profane arts of the nineteenth century being tossed aside for "capitalist" "ergonomic" esthetics.
In essence what Kant should have said is, and what later artists were mistaken for is that no work of Christian deity or Husymans or Oscar Wilde is so mistakenly different. It projects or "condences" into matter as Delville said. Hence we are positivists who ADD MORE. This can not be discredited by the current positivist Status Quo, we are artists and avant gardists. We can't be cancelled out??
We craft reason with only one metaphysical purpose, to create a canvas where mankind can walk in. And in some sense then can be said of some philosophers. What of your logical fallacies you have to see anywhere? What was ever to it? These people did not craft paintings. Devised architecture. And now their thousands of voices their dissolved chicks with their dissolved world must be overcome. A barren "wasteland" as TS Elliot said, indeed, an opportunity then. A wasteland because you stated that as an objective reality? Because you had nothing to do as a phophet of a wasteland to fuck it all up?! But if I say otherwise and idealize that would be utopian?? In fact both ARE utopian are n't they?? I got into it, I challenge you to get into it, and never come out, or come out fighting this world, the choice is yours. But of logical fallacies only exists a miserable ounce, to be swept in the insane eyes of the universal theory. Most of which universal systematics considered today is not logical at all. Apart from that you could have considered that earlier that existence was n't very rational, and that therefore rationality can't be rational. To identify with the "outer" is n't at all rational, why it can not just be "about us" is not rational, to do more then to just "produce" excrements is already more theistic then anything. To Sympathize is virtue itself it is heartfelt it is a reward in itself. Now to do something about organic artisan sensory value within life, art and man central to composition, a generous man perhaps, maybe a more complicated man out of which an allegory may still be developed. It is not therein then mysterious that the Matrix is based on the modern world and on kant And Plato, basically they both created this world. But of the world now is left but the idea. The shadow. The creative expression, is a matter of the artisan life which today must become a ritual outside ergonomics, and this will be the last step. When fantasy comes out of ergonomics, fantasy or what is none other then enhanced artisan reality. Decorative reality. We might even say that that can not be achieved without sentences that are bound more so in pathos and subjectivity, we don't need more analysis and less mythology to certify reality. ON THE CONTRARY?! Its like we do not need to look more like apes the further we evolved from them. ON THE CONTRARY?! Without myth and eoloquence, yes decorative, binding, slower pace, a society can not be achieved, this radical isms society with its blunt words needs to dillute again in more classical books and a more classical rhetorics. The languages need to be formalized again too. But most of all, the world is gone and we want to express ourselves, our generations have nothing in common with the restraint of some logic once deemed natural, with sade, we say what we want because its an urge, and terribly irrational, but we, are, irrationalists, surrealists. Without any subjugation to a surpassed relativity, we want to consume, devour and reform the world, not get stuck on the worlds relative objections to change our tastes. "That everyone cares about money alone", "that nobody cares about beauty anymore", but then they say "it is all subjective", there could n't have been a lauzyer lesson for people. Lets reject it. Deconstructivism will always lead to an ergonomics man decentralized, esthetics and nature decentalized, subjectivity will cause that. "Owh but we don't really need a decor, the lights go out and you watch the movie so who needs a real cinema." Well yes, the actors don't need to exist, we just have computers invent the movies, and edit them all themselves. We don't need anyone?? In fact that therapist who provided me generously with medication from his in turn deconstructivist sect is about to be replaced by an automatic pill robot. Hence this reasoning does n't work anywhere, and will be repeated over and over again in this society a thousand fold, untill the tire of artisan life, the sensory gratification that an artisan life gives, that holds your life as pleasures as body together needs to be postulated. (In effect I would write somewhere i'd start a bank with actual safes and actual counters, an art nouveau bank as it were, a matter of ritual. But in that ritual IS life, without that, we might as well consider ergonomics DEATH? But people are acting like lemmings and storm for the cliffs. They desire this death, whereas it is only a carrier for artisan within it. The structure needed us to advance or we would not be able to survive.) It is the last stage. Beyond which stage anything is once more a possibility. Gothic worlds as much as sword fights and medieval battles. The very fact you may be restored from death, and which will become accepted soon. Means. You are just a play. All you need to do, is get glory. There is no more other, job application that is in any way necessary. And indeed, DEATH shall no longer exist. It was ever nothing at all. it is not ever more obsolete, we applaud here the experiments with eternal life as with ressurecting past lives, geniuses as much as lotteries etc. We will get a classic pick axe, compose a descent ritual, state some lines in dignity and good wishes for their new lives, and get Leonardo Da Vinci or even Van Gogh or Hitler back from the grave or engineered out of a skull piece, and give them a new life. EACH had errors and merits. And THAT is especially what the civil class today gets wrong IN EVERY INSTANCE. EACH has ERRORS and MERITS. If you learn to write THAT you can write a worthwhile and readable essay about everyone. If you act just civil with your five word insults everything becomes tedious and the notion that anyone worthwhile will pay attention is futile. Your just all talking to yourselves and you are all getting bored. Maybe each stupid comment should be signed with RESTORE THE ECOLOGY, GO TO MARS NOW, simple, both ends of the specturm we need to work on solved. BOTH regression, and what the progress was firstly intended for all this time, to expand territory. A WHEEL is to expand territory. ALL technology is to reduce the artisan sense, the emotive quality in its essence of life, and all that is again capable of creating bubbles, of life, here on earth and elsewhere across the universe.
Again, where we used to pull the chariot of labour, where we used to delve up a temple out of the resistence of mechanics, where a structure forms through engineering capabilities, this no longer applies, we can develop all, we can have houses grow automatically through nanotechnology. Or print houses. Is it desirable? Not really, suffice basic needs is only part of the solution. The artisan reality is the full INSIDE of the fruit, technology is but the peel. In which it can be contained, it is not in the least desirable to print all houses, have all cars drive automatically. I survive in the most amount of uselessness. I don't deem myself at all useless. I get payed automatically, I drive a bus for which i don't even have to pay and tap a card against a machine that bleeps for which there is no reason at all. The bus driver is not even needed. Simply, uselessness is not useless, because there is a faith, within the artisan reality. The truth to me is the richess of the capacity for allegory. Which is however not certified by the subjective notion it is even greatly degenerated and denied because of it, because of the very subjective notion. A subject alone and its needs starves, it starves the arts, it starves its purpose, of which 40 or 50 percent is excess, its churches, its art, and who is not to say it is not heaven sent?! Subjectiviy developed into a culture ever moving forward. But no technology needs ever be outdated. It would be "outdated" untill everything is useless. Useless being the individual or societal restraint to survive, the friction against the industrial cut and paste and copy capacity. The only restrain on it is in effect the artisan quality of a casette deck or vinyl record player, this is the ONLY existence in life, rationality seems but to rationalize things out of existence, there is SOMETHING ELSE, there were subjectivity and industrialization goes, is but a quantumprocessor of human musculature etc. We have surpassed a balance for a long time. Artisan slaughter, artisan porcelain, artisan steel, artisan architecture, artisan furniture, artisan sculptures. And they say to artist, go get a job in a factory. Yes i can see that. Not much decoration for your movie theatres. Not much decoration on your house hahh? Everything is subjective i imagine. Thats why you don't need actual art but order a Louis Quatorze or an angel from factories now? We can work at the conveyor belt. We don't need artists "they need to be taken off of their cloud" as they say in employment offices. YES, we need more empty supermarkets and newer shelves. WHY on earth should there be ART or the artisan?? Lets get to some reality?! WHy not have this world be degenerate and kitshy and all shambles all together. With NOTHING Of worth? I should get real and travel all over the world for my job, sit in a traffic congestion to contribute to society.
So at last, when we made everything useless, beauty and nature kick in again, yes we can agree with every troll and beat every troll with it. Yes you are allowed to your platform. What DO you have to say. And as life became useless, death became useless, global extinction could become a reality. And if the democracy could do it, then even nazism indeed becomes useless, and even that becomes very funny. If we can bring all the jews back to life; everything becomes very funny. NOW lets just consider it THAT funny we do what is to the best of our abilities not to create the world into a desert. There are a few of them around we prefer to turn into forests. And for those who said Piss on the MOon is disgusting. Please, i would have, as a poet, personally brought a flower, and put it in the dirt there. And be the first one to have planted a flower there. I imagined Tulip fields on the moon already. A gothic empire on it even. YOU PISS ON THE EARTH, WHY ON EARTH WOULD NT YOU PISS ON THE MOON?! THATS HOW NATURE WORKS RIGHT. Get a life. I hear some of the most stupid comments that everyone in this world finds absolutely self evident. READ, A BOOK. And for the love of your MODEST understanding, RESPECT IT, not being modest at the advent of a new idea is ARROGANCE OF STUPIDITY. how many times have i been cronfronted with the ARROGANCE OF STUPIDITY. Unbelievable. You can provoke into civilisation a new idea. And be intelligent, most of what you do will be considered insane or simple and self evident. WEll it is self evident now you would when you go to Mars just SHOVE the fricking trees in the dirt REGARDLESS, but it was n't so fricking self evident to people FIVE SECONDS AGO???? You are a genius in your own right if you learn to respect what you will soon read. You are an idiot if you think what is said in its simplicity and what was suffered did not come at great expence to deliver you a simple beauty. In fact every dumbass comment was just repitition of what surrealists came up with, there is no merit or actual pride you can have being a dumbass, its not just it was forbidden to you once to be such a dumbass, the whole thing was preconceived by artists themselves of who'm to most are long forgotten, they are effectively then decapitated, you give them a cage, you let them steam, eventually they will commit suicide, and we will pitty and mourn for them as inspiration usually comes with compassion and sorrow for those even who we can clearly see are lesser beings, but likewise, we laugh and rejoyce too, as we know we would have always be under them and act patiently, while they rant and scream. WIthout that artists libertinism all these trolls, and atheists for that matter, would be devout christians. It is your life and mind. It would n't exist without these books. So for some ideas i present, maybe you will all become self indulgent arrogant pricks soon. I had twenty years of total fear to live in, being called insane, and actually being drugged against my will for those twenty years, which pills did n't amount to nothing then humiliation and fat, bad health and all kinds of side effects and detriments and intoxification finally. So maybe if you practive twenty years of fear, don't take it too far then, my considerations. DO something with it. Don't just fend it off or start running blindly with it. You have done that BEFORE?!
We argue that the solutions, for a ritualization of life lie in the Romantic and Symbolist ideals be it reversed to what they should be. To certify in a positive way any ritual, smallest or more grand and orchestrated. We applaud where all things in life become useless and free, where you buy a train ticket or a movie ticket for free and show it whereas it has no point, just the gesture counts. Money has no intrinsic value, it just passes, but the gesture with which you accept, the "thank you" and "if you please", the touch of hands, the touch of the money, to feel the fibre, the very depiction on the money, is all art, is all life, hence a society of futurism, in space or on other planets, can not or should not be this "bacterial growth of subjects within a nano technological and quantum dispenser of subjects. Art, has become, life, life has become, art. Then we will have come to a degree of sincerity and art for art. But we need to develop from the ridicule and intrinsic innovation hysteria and Kantian philosophy. Build it into something new, bound and dilluted in the classical pristine, away from relativity because it exists and defies the stars with a comprized material feat of momentary existence. Every piece of life is a stroke on a canvas. As all becomes useless, all becomes art! That does n't mean as society deems today, you have to value it LESS! as a matter of fact it becomes necessity, for education, throughout, art, mythology, religion, and metaphysics of and within reality, perception and the corridor of perception. In that sense vampires, angels, elves, might not have existed but if there is evolution he could and all of them could, should, and actually would come into existence soon. As the imagination is just a guide and hive for mankind. You just need to look for the keys and see what becomes, to tout victory for irony and stupidity has a very limited future and is not sustainable for a very long time, and with that "not very long" i do mean. Its is not sustainable for another year or even months from now.


"To criticize the economy is its greatest advert. We can only let go of it, take off like a balloon into space, and require an artisan and mythologic prowess and severity in our imagination. As any third of faith, apart from imagination or economy, or in other words, apart from the speculative, the story as it presents, as it is stone, or spaceflight, a progress that presented itself naturally out of the construction of the first road, a third reality is not present."

"We don't believe in an ecological foot print, nor do we believe in consumption. If everything is in a balance, there is no ecological foot print nor consumption. Mankind just swells to grow forests on other planets, for fifty years its been stacking more technology and biospheres on earth and growing like a bacteria. Because of this subjectivity. If you take responsability to COMPOSE?!! to realize nature is a balance between fashion, architecture, ecology. language, imagination, sewege and agreculture. TO say everything is subjective is deranged, and it should have been seen like that from the beginning. I mean Why did n't Kant read HESIOD"
We will learn from neoclassicism, and build grand decors of nature more beautiful then nature, we'll do coral reef transplants and regrow the forests of Europe now. And there shall be no debate or deterrant upon that. Fisherman will be hired to dive and regrow dead zones, and transplant coral, grow coral in aquariums, any way we can. We will replace all hotels on all coast lines with aquariums in art nouveau. To sustain the fish stocks, we will have supermarkets with gardens on the roof and in the cellars with towers with windmills to provide energy. IN ESTHETICS, not in scientific condom design.

We want ALL the ocean floors dead zones RESTORED, we want ALL the ten trillion fish BACK, we want the European forests restored and art deco and art nouveau high rise to replace the subjects houses and suburbs. FOR THAT, AND ANY DISCUSSION THAT IT IS NOT TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS, there will be WAR. If the subjects talk about THAT in stead of their cook books and saturation and lack of responsability. THEN maybe it will HAPPEN. For now we need as little of the Christian tale of the wonderous catch of fish, we need even less the capitalist tale of the man who learns to catch fish he will depend on himself, we need mankind as a commodity, which in any case needs allegories like a man who breeds out of several fish more fish and gives fish back. Which means he will dig holes in the ground to furbish enough trees and growth of crops for society etc. Which means he needs allegories to sustain his own culture rather then just dwell on the past and other cultures. Which seems to be tiresome in its own right and is part of a tired culture in its own right. If you have the ability to kill then you are a God over that, then it is also befit to be generous to a great deal of that. And to CREATE, in other terms mankind needs himself prophets and artists expertise and education.

For the restoration of artisan dignity in mankind, resisting the technological nothingness, and living with the means superior of space technology which was always space technology, we can do away with all skyscrapers, or we can do away with all antiques and beauty. But the artisan WAR to demolish a few artisan artifacts, is a small price to pay compared to the artisan marvels we will build in the future.

The subjects bacteriological growth of easy formulaic structures has left as a natural growth a hive without culture, cultures in the hive must be broken out and placed in an actual cultural structure, we deem the construction of the hive modernism and the growth of alternative cultures within a natural principle. To get those newer and younger and counter subject and amorph people out of it we also see as a natural evolution. The suits and modernists are herein the ones who now will listen to the intelligentsia constructing the newer culture.
Also by 2028 or sooner we will have a fully functional asteriod destruction shield for Earth AND Mars AND venus, as they will start to be inhabited by that time.

"what i'm saying is, if the intelligent had an aristocrat. They would go to him and advise him. But now, where you going to go? Who you going to advise? Who will do something? Everyone is posting their own subjective values; and the world is indeed going to die. So. Emmm. Just as a problem, you have one. Who is going to be IT!!






Tristithea to her publisher

To the publisher

Sir, Yourladyship.
I have here a manifest that will be read just as well by any citizen on this planet, It concerns the millions of artists who been dumped into the gutter by Immanuel Kant, and would like to decorate supermarkets now and to a higher plane of artistic merit, even so as to make it a tad more ecologic and as a whole new vision on the “structure” that today also reasonably looks like a “structure” why that is apparently no one knows, and no one has thought about it so far, because this reasonable joke goes at the expence of the masses and politicians and business people, even if the joke also is at the expence of Wittgenstein, Immanuel Kant and Schopenhauer and so many others, not in the least at the expence of psychiatry... the clarification of which is the intention of this manifest. That the masses and also u as a publisher with this stand before an accomplished fact is assumed. That I as a present day van Gogh have little respect or see little merit in investments in my work or see even the use of the payments to this book is so startling as sardonic, as much doubtfull this dramatic and certainly boisturous, angry berzerker mentality, this not in the least by the suffering done to me by this society -a society that you support. That it is now up to us is certain.
Gladly you will publish now my work in such a manner that classical minds can also make money again, and can pay their own programmers and artists. It was a very miserable time in the gutter but i assure you that this analysis or my work does n’t have to diminish in comparison to Immanuel Kant, one Schopenhauer, a Lautreamont, Sade or Huysmans,
There is also a reason while you already are saying and thinking “this person can better work in a factory” that is part of your religion. Most of you are just as religious as the high days of the inquisition. Where do you think your decoration of your cinema’s and skyscrapers has gone to? That i want to adress this is the object of this manifest. As much i stand on the fact that u consider this in its entirety, and see that it is undefiably the deficit of modern society and lays out the map to that deficit, whereby also is indicated your responsability to present this feature to the world.
.
Media is not solely for cook books and subjectivity teachings apropriate, one thinks we can offer alternatives.

That i guarantee the irreversable resurfacing of artists that are laying in the gutter today and indeed present the renaissence to you with this manifest is clear to everyone.


None the less is the international force and completed description on the ground of scientific and metaphysical theory in more or less simple and visually striking accusations relevant and without further adeu a nessecity on this end of 200 year thought. I end it here, i don’t think there is much to contend with.


Mind you. There are only three options, or this manifest is read by anyone, and then all underground movements are coming to play ball with the ehh “your” mainstream and your reasonably alien society, or the deep green resistence of this world and other sabotage “your” bacterial growth culture and development. In which case you go backward, and again look to go forward, in which case the bacteriological development without composition again proceeds to the decay, the ultimate decay. U can see that i always win? The solutions are not really proposed by myself, I have a few, but to setup the whole system, we will have to have some sorcery to us to bring about all kinds of new ingenious minds, that you would supress genius with me at the forefront just shove my head in the dirt and refuse to help us is reasonably scandalous.
Let it be you then to read this, I beg of you, and try to understand it somewhat, as for the intelligent reader this is a load more apparent then for you. Wich more understanding reader it will have to reach, REGARDLESS of the popularity of cook books and modern books.
This book is in advance a classical masterpiece, reasonably anachronristic none the less are there indeed readers of older books. That i am with that the avant garde and thus the frontline of all those intellectuals that are hidden in old books and are now storming your ivory tower, is a fact on which you may be accounted for. “Times they are a changing.” that i have no other choice, that most books that you publish won’t change a thing, or that i am in psychiatry labelled as a “genius” is not my fault, nor is it permitted to perpetually wave new thoughts away as too confronting to society. If i am to die, it will be because i lobotomized myself, something which i have been indeed close to accomplish, and a whole new Van Gogh was i then. Owh my he asked a woman a grain of rice for which he would ask ten billion dollars to build her a palace, owh my his inventions, owh my his new chess game with 200 pieces per player, etc etc, what remains of your planet, with 9 billion Hitlers is only a matter of debate. If i become prey to investors that buy my canvasses? I am afraid it will be pointless and will lead to absolutely nothing.

I leave you with the quotes at the beginning of this manifest.
"Again, the balance has moved too far. A cell phone or an Ipad could have been part of a Victorian or a Baroque or a renaissence world. THat it is n't possible IS the whole religion today!? To see that becomes an obliterating, startling paradox, and the only way you will see the present culture and with it, philosophy and science, for what it is. "


I therefore wish no more to receive a standard or officious letter.
I just want to hear
I admit, you are right, we are sorry for your inconvenience.
Or the short notion.
“We strongheadedly ignore you and will defy you in the utter angryness of our stupidity”
Authority exists.

For the Shortcomings in the past 200 years of philosophy i will by name of Immanuel Kant Schopenhauer and Sade apologize at another time and place. As much as it is an excuse to you, that i bereaved you from the beauty of esthetics and imagination, something of which i now want to correct. What in advance should give me as much eminence and relevance as first named, and rather not have me another thirty years in the gutter to balance on a bit, or even worse, as my actual present days are.

Society is at a point where it will crash in a complete fashion.

U can with that accept newer thoughts, that could direct it into a new movement, as much left as right, or you can keep your head in the sand, and count on it that i will get my manifest to so many people.

I count on the responsability and carefullness of your publishing business.

If these words no longer appear in your book files, let me with this reintroduce them, and then you have nothing to do but to act apropriatly.


My experience with publishers is, and meanwhile with the high tide, that i presume, that you will be pointed to the calling of your professional duty, and have to be reminded of that. If in the last time you have not experienced the real bother of your calling as a publisher, here is your chance. A responsability in this case of the most modern books being reasonably more perverted then at once thought. Everyone knows that, everyone knows how hollow the world is. Everyone buys hysterically, and laughs, i don’t participate at all. The unrest and artisan merit and artisanship of which i refuse to participate in this money society and advert society you will read below, and this not in the least all to contribute, to the decay of that very civilisation, and in turn then the resurfacing of mankind. We don't need to fix the decay, the decay is all fine with me. More room for a resurgance.
I am other then that not interested of what you think of this personally, or where your publication business is situated i treat of the very deficit of the structure, if everyone now thinks to twat at me personally like a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a household bat, an old granny, a working class labour frustrated or an employee, a politician etc, in that is this entire culture, if you think you can do that, i have a few very pleasent surprises for you that are only becoming more urgent. The question is if you are going to catch up with me. Hopefully then you will one day. It is as gravity then still. What is not the least bit a commercial writing, ridiculized i have been, violanetly surpressed yes, been there, done that. Of which you are apart by the way. It is now up to you to make it self evident.
With a lack of an answer, it is not so much a dissapointment or a determent, but a few serious blows of a hammer, more to sustain this absolute mess i am in. “Fuck with the devil, you only make him stronger.” forthcoming i am not so far off, as Black Metal said, we were not satanists, they forced us to become that.
It is outstanding that Jordan Peterson has to become famous by insulting someone, and that it gets a whole hysteria over there. I am not capable to offend anyone, and am just trying to see the compromises and problematics of modern right wing and left wing movements, and that which i am therefore proponent of my merit and not some kind of hysteria, -God forbid it would be some murder or fire, which psychiatry now proposes will be the end of my dear soul and in which it will culminate- that I should have ended up in this waffles, oil balls and chocolate land. Is your mission.
The murder and fire of the society, i see it coming if you keep going, and i am very provisional and have a great look on things, that i at that also insist that my very miserable person should be part of that society, no matter how much i dispise it, is the murder and fire that burns in my soul for this significant reason, and for some time, and that i have controlled it so far, CONSIDERING the circumstances of enduring humiliation, futile dialoges, medication and such likes more, and also considering the meaning of this manifest, i will be selling the empty packages of my medication they give me, to Sothebies and Christies. By highest bid. I will sign it Or not. it can be traced now otherwise, don’t even need to sign it. My own artisan work is a little too expencive, in close inspection it is individualistic, and therefore I will prohibit it for further lack of high regard and buy it back. With the proceeds of this book i can make a nice effort. I can also then find a lawyer, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and a psychiatry complaint officer, of which now are all free, and definatly worth that amount of money and are by the way not in the least bit scholared, professional or realizing what is going on.. How they do that, is just as absurd as not being published for twenty years. Whereby i also end up in psychiatry again and again. “The drama, the anguish, the despair, the melancholy. How terrible, that the world will soon tremble, at one individual soul, that not did conspire to the past 200 years. I may have built Neuschwanstein, yes, that of me can be said. Time for you to realize that. And let me build one. AGAIN.”

Manifest against a hysterical Democracy Led By the People
The problem of Subjectivity in Modernism
And how it projects into matter.

Tractatus Hystericae Democratiae A populo
Problematat Subjecttitatus Modernismus
Projectatet Materia quam

CURTSY
We can consider that the greatest misunderstanding in modernism, is that it was not the aristocrats who were more noble then the commoner, it was on the contrary the artist who had any commoner live a noble decorative life. In which any personality may use and abuse it as he deems fit. But aristocracy remains the standard of beauty and the meaning of a philosophy, the grace of a lyrics, the elegance over the excrement. Of who'm aristocrats were once babies too, they surely did n't get their taste for art and splendour and quality from stating to them that everything is an object to a subject. Or that through that problem there is no possibility for a prowess and elegance for imagination which is eventually metaphysics, if not one for all, which is basically all he could verify, then certainly all would be for each single one, on the contrary we made all irrelevant and diminished the very light of existence, equating all to the dirt of existence. In the analytic rather then the formal, modernism runs dead. In the restoration of the formal, and reevaluating perception, we must emancipate the civil, and find ourselves with all modernists their potential, and 200 years of art and philosophy that needs to be done all over again. Yes, rather, looking back from twohundred years time, as nothing done was truly accurate, and in the beauty of the academics and symbolists, who ventured ever more below in claustrophobia, we lost the audience and the purpose to our cause, to create a palace, civilisation, in a beautiful scenery, ecology, with the female central. As the decorative, vain, and decadent becomes prime, as the male, functional, and masculin, is now redundant. We are not in 2020 we could argue, we are at 1800, Nothing of what was done or conceived after it was entirely plausible. At least the artists carried on. but the thread of that is now leading to a certain despair as well.

TIME
"We have reached from a bottom dead point, the mainstream, to the top again, when we realize, science will make anything possible, the exponential scale has tipped from a horizontal rise into a vertical absolute point of possibility, and at this point it is necessary to understand, that time does not exist in culture nor in the universe. This is the cultural and esthetic shift in the world as much as Galileo placed the sun at the center of the solar system. We can say, where we said this is baroque, that is the middle ages, and put it all in plastic, we can say now, we are baroque, we are the middle ages, and get it all OUT of the plastic. Time does not exist as modernists claim, which also constitutes for the mainstream their concept of having to act "normal" elves or vampires can not exist "because you have to adapt to the positivism and "effectualization" of reality of the modern, you have to, consider Legolas skating on his shield was practically that sole modernist thing in the motion picture. And everything about is ridicule under that notion, and under which effect can exist no real esthetics" In fact, multiculturalism to mainstream people, if that means an arab or indian can come in Europe and US and open a nightstore, if that is the standard of what is deemed culture, then also for very much more radical and Western mythological fabrics and formal fabrics of culture are indeed culture and must also reemerge in the west, and they must rise to the surface. Which means we don't accept no sloppy mosque in a garage either, everthng must be properly considered, or discarded. As much as the ritual was so sacred, we can say the deity exists if the ritual is indeed sacred, to believe in something outside that is certainly possible but not the consensus and realization people contend with today, so it must be done otherwise. Not to be contested that finally we see that all is a web, an ether of electricity with reality merely as a skin draped on top of that.

METAPHYSICS
"A culture, a species, is like a deity, as an allegory in a very humane capacity, to which a thought or a phase of it, was another life lesson. Errors which were in its birth, that it will always repeat in newer form what it was in its essence. And this allegory is its notion, that it builds, on the circumstances in which it lives, and molds into its collective counscious and goal, of which now must be broken again into a new pile of dust. To fabricate the purest eshetics out of absolute decay"

"That in death there would be a perpetual not aware that you are not aware, etc, is so frightening. That we are therefore, stuck with a poison of intelligence and reason, in something entirely indifferent to intelligence and reason yes, that we are alone, and endlessly poor. That we are so alone and endlessly poor, that even the thought to exist leads us to the urgence of our suicide. Is a thought, rejected by a clear metaphyics of and in that very reason. And perception which is all we are, here may seaze to exist. What is noted as other but can never be at that side. Faith is here, bound in an organism, of which magnificent embodiment of the stars, we will never leave. Not even in death. To Schopenhauer he was n't entirely sure, that there is something as a mercyfull devil. An above and beyond, can be detracted from vast new scientific study and is dorment in this manifest, as a criticism of subjectivity and the positivist notion of time space and causality." "positivism was a stage of evolution, entirely dialectical in its own right, which we must now overcome its detrimental lack of esthetics in which ordinary people are entirely absorbed."

LANGUAGE
Language is a social construct, it would overlap, that there is a notion that I think therefore I am. Or that there is an object to a subject and we can not really know what is behind it. That it is not commonly understandable to establish a truth is hereby contested and invalidated, again, how on earth can subjectivity be subjective, how on earth can that you only know that you think be a matter of ultimate truth?! We have agreed for 200 years that everything is subjective, and realized our own distopia. which we incidentally had to write first. A world comes from a book. We can write any book. We can create any world. Metaphysics just requires a bit of good will. And especially the criticism of the past 200 year in philosophy requires a bit of scepticism in its own right. As it is not possible to be free without to see it. We come now to a realization of two entirely seperate colors, the color of the idea, concept, clean hygenic industrial realization. A notion that is often prescribed THROUGH adherence to subjectivity. And a color kitsh, nature, opulance, elves, vampires, anything deemed outside subjectivity, yes, religion, contrary to what is noted we can SEE it. This is the new order of things. You can not simply speak of individualism. Considering that that makes many people elude to a lack of opinion about these vital colors, of which are part of a sobriety, ecology, resistence to commercial advertising and its hyserical ironies. We see this, in the case of racism, this confusion. Where we can not tolerate that something becomes general, we can't tolerate that it is stated as a particular. Racism can not be tolerated in generality. For the state, so no one is allowed to state a racist remark. The state for that reason should have an overal generosity, or it would n't work, but this would n't allow people to say selfish things? Equally the state being generous and democratic can then not allow fascist opinions, whereas that is fascist, in a fascist state we can not allow democratic opinions, but the other way around? Would be pretty paradoxical. The same goes for Subjectivity. As soon as you consider giving people the notion that everything is subjective, we rephrain from having people actually resist the general notion with their own taste. We disarmed rather then armed them. And we made the culture in that frustrated where they were strong creative individuals with their own fundamental taste in culture. This applies to right and left, fascism and communism, in which currently remains a trivial, degenerated debate, which simply is growing more of the matrix, deu to the subjectified populace. What i claim here, is that subjectivity emancipated only the commercial and innovative, and totally abolished the ecological and artisan. To deny metaphysics, is to take a stance against metaphysics, and to realize it, hence Kant wrote the book of the twentieth century. We better start building him cathedrals then is my consideration. With the doubt on metaphysics the very notion of meaning was declared redundant. Any notion of Buddha or Christ was thrown behind reality. (whereas the proponence is still there, owh discard, just consume, enjoy, as if Buddha or Christ see that in this world as the valid course.) Any notion you may have is thrown in a solipsist prison. We should n't therefore emancipate subjectivity, we should actually emancipate just about everything ELSE.
You could argue that that is relatively futile and inconspicuous, to offer a criticism of subjectity. However it would be futile and inconspicuous then to come up with it, and which has led to this whole modern society. (In which you hear the hollow heads constantly cackle back to any real opinion that should educate or indicate something that "everything is subjective") And incapsulates any esthetics or imagination, in a world of irony whereas it concerns content matter, or a world of relativity where it conserns its esthetic prowess. So we just propose, with the reversal of that theory that we "open the floodgates" of culture to new possibilties, and review and relive the past 200 years. Which in turn, would entice us to look back at all history, as they were already very analytic canons. However with the subjectivity. We also ran into a rage, a hype, for analysis. We consider conceptualizing the past. We are the caretaker of this conceptualized past. What is indicated here is that that conceptualization with the death of subjectitity and analysis itself, and with the return of the inspiration and composition as highest value, that the concept of time within culture must entirely fall dead. Whats more instead of prying on the earth and culture, being effectively parasites on all, it would induce the masses and the human being to effectively be MOBILIZED for something.
When we therefore killed the majority and their present "everything is subjective" esthetics on a higher plane and a standard can be part of societal spheres. Artisan and old technologies can be valued, that have as yet been deemed unfunctional. People will need to take a position within an esthetics of a period of time way before this. And last but not least, we are not simply a composition of muscles deu for fitness on earth and in space, we are not subjects in cubicles. We can reevaluate and enhance, steampunk, gothic, art deco, art nouveau, romanticism, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, black metal, gothic, etc, as apart of the main composition. As our fixation on subjectitity falls away, and thereby the conceptualization of time fades away. To live in a castle by candle light, is entirely plausible. To be the Empress of a forest, is entirely plausible, yes, necessary. The main subject philosophy has us think we are bacteria, and indeed merely expand as bacteria, as we have done for 200 years now. It was basically a society running on an automatic pilot. Nobody considered a direction to it. People were looking to do it always within subjectivism. I myself too had throw away furniture, had grown up in the realization of a small organic farm, yet because of the subjectivity, you naturally deviate towards fiction and modern society. Little did i know i would fall into the dead end of it. It can effectively not last. The philosophy is a whole dead end street?!
Again, futile and inconspicuous it may seem, but through the words of immanuel Kant, it is that we are today even alive, in a very literal, physical sense. There would n't be Adolf Hitler, not communism. So basically every sperm cell was shifted into a new course, and he literally had so much influence with mere words, that we exist because of him. Which leaves the concept of everything just being "subjective" very paradoxical. In fact if he would be thinking of it today he would n't publish it as of course, that was HIS opinion entirely in its turn. It also would explain why authors would only warn for distopias, and effectively created them. Whereas any attempt to a Utopia was schewed and frowned upon, you won't find it anywhere. THen how would reality ever change exactly if we are but to discuss distopias? Here we consider that if it is left to the individual, he would also be needing that decor as part of the canons of which he is apart. And then the notion of modern architecture is worthless and surpassed. What would become, or what people who consider but subjectivity or a moderate notion of esthetics really are is unclear, perhaps it is natural indeed as mainlander and Hartman uttered that these people would go insane and commit suicide.
The notion that we have our own culture and do not have the authority then to, say, rebuild the acropolis, is also surpassed. We can do that. We are artisan too if we want. This would not be some kind of delusional opinion. It is effectively supported by this general theory which supercedes subjectivity by far. Not in the least it is a necessity to replace that comforting "subjectity" by the actual necessity to verified and artisan imagination and allegory. Of which now has been effaced from every movie theater, which here is argued, is merely the church of today. The temples of the imagination. We could then indeed conclude, that metaphysics, considering the consensus is now that everything is subjective, and a whole culture is built on it, that the notion of subjective became its own metaphysics. Or at least somewhere ran through, being within reason and perception no matter what you said. For which reality apparently is a whole corridor of mirrors, in which we can indeed say. If physics is all that it entails, one of the mirrors of physics through which we walk is broken. We have introduced something, that could n't actually exist. That this now is deemed as alien life, science, and consumption, advertising, tourism, business, politics, kapitalism etc is merely all part of visions derived from the subjectity prison.
With the collapse of subjectivity, we can also introduce such wild notions as the skin of reality, being its entirely new field of interest, "reality" as much criticized as a word by Schopenhauer, the notion actually exists, its not JUST a working process, -as far as it relates to truth its a pretty detrimental and plausable that it WORKS, and that it hence can not produce truth. Or that truth becomes manifest as soon as you doubted it.- the "corridor of perception" exist, and "illusions" are apart of reality. -This whole matrix today being one of them.- As much as the eminence of mythology and the new challenges of religion, and the sensory affectual notion of piety, which is more part of poets and the generous or entirely kind spiritualists, and again, confirmed as late by various peculiar theories, positivism should be frightened lately. To the positivist at least the skin of reality over science is completely mysterious, the societal structure, how it evolves is a complete dogma and a tool from scientific decuctions and this truth of the anti-artisan, that at least it must recognize. Gods and awaeness is itself an illusion. Inspiration is a truth which renders, again, the ones who live an inpentrable subjective modern reality apart from any esthetics or passed considerations must soon go insane for. Many commit suicide but i'm saying its the wrong people.There is a tearing at the fraily and the profound here?!


APPENDIX
"From the most miserable of ages, into the eternity of a new masterpiece"

Dream is the primal construct of everything, that would not be nudity sitting and eating berries in a forest, upon which a dream crystalizes into matter and is all culture.
It is the primal construct that where you are is irrelevant opposed to where you are going. You being the wave that you carry and touches upon other things.
You have Nietzsche and Schopenhauer but the problem is that the majority just stacks its bullshit on top of that. To deviate on them would be enough. Which i'm doing, but not quite then, i'm attacking all the systems the bullshit on top of us attempts to formulate. Its not an easy choir. And you grow terribly insane by the simplicity of the objection against some value. Which you hold dear as self evident. Indeed, when anything would be subjective, a value akin to something etherical as religion needed but be plucked for oneself, and it will need to be in emotion and perception. In art and esthetics, empathy and generosity, whatever the philosophers have said, this is prime, it needs not be denied, but this system is constructed rather entirely upon that! A logical construct leading to a matrix and subjects driving around in cars, having all insulated houses, is not at all what we wanted. At least if they want to be subjects let them dress and eat and live in a house like Imanuel Kant. Whatever the allegory was that they had against aristocracy, we are now with civil subjects, and we mean to grow aristocratic tastes. In the passing of time, this becomes only, and as it stands a final mission now to emancipate mythology and religion, spirituality and the occult. If a notion is what you believe, then that belief as a measure of sadistic opportunity can not be denounced, equally, if you just adhere to the notion that "all is subjective" there comes a time when you get quite stuck there, and it is more or less the initiative here to wipe them all away these subjects, of which would cling to a trivial concept of present society and recognize this as a worthy subjects structure. Or convert them to the actual opposite, in which they would fade in a sensory artistic reality, which at least would again be of some interest to anyone, if they would visit their house, they would stumble on amounts of artisan art. Yes, that an industrially fabricated leprachaun and lions on the car lane etc. That that all would be subjective remains of little doubt. Question if that needs to be the end all of things.

Of course several plucked the fruit of free individualism, but it was against the majority, here we must prick the balloon of the subjectivity being the final objective, and we irradicate with this the overlying mass and mainstream casual culture. As for a thinking, who is the builder of the cathedral of the future, to create all free roaming subjects and, incidentally, a lot of unemployed ones, or suicidal ones, and garbage consuming ones. It is not a very emancipatory chore to start from subjects, there have been now some distillants of the strength of will rooted in fascist uprisal against mass imbecility. Then there is the communists regarding the current establismhent equally as fascists. While the fascists are considering the establishment is a communist plot and conspiracy. We consider here that apart from formal, esthetic advantages and the urgance for revolt which is indeed necessary, their politics and basic stance does n't amount to much. Some nutrients to solidify ones own stance uprisal of any movement comes from the notion of mere esthetic quality. Where society built freedom and became monotone it is art knocking back on the door, saying, where have you left me?!
Religion had people build for mercy and salvation, go to war for arts sake and robed with culture. For a subject philosophy they say we are not worth anything so you are not worth anything so give me my social security and my retirement and my dental plan and my consumer goods. (Lock those in an eccentricity closer to metaphysics in lunatic asylums by that, call them sick and scoff them.) By any account the turn the other cheek by Christ has grown into the sardonic turn the other cheek of wise man and artists. Where are you now? And now i have to bow down to you to pick you up? To artists religion should be relative, to the populace it is all but relative, a notion where nothing can become a dogma and where the subjectivity a notion in itself to which everyone needs to be converted by empty and hollow minds of unfilled masses. The artists, walking among them, without the recognitions of it crystalizing in theatres and churches and city halls, now have to hear it everywhere. "everyone thinks something differently." of which the weight holds the culture of nothing, and the theaters of nothing, and the entertainment of nothing, the advertizing of nothing. The mere proceeds of eating and shitting for nothing, and the harnassing of more and more energy for every gadget, soothing nothing. And cutting down all the forests and ruining every composure of nature and arts, walking by nature and arts, and developing, without a medieval composition, without an ancient greek composition, without any lesson or artistic notion of the past. We need to have them understand, that mankind no longer mere employs growing, but needs to restrain and breed its own destinty, religion, and COMPOSITION. Out of, the nothing, which is apart of any creation, just another creation of man. So if it was treu, then it was also a humble faith as any other. As you will read, it became indeed another very humble faith.
We stand now atop 200 years of culture, for any sake of culture just saying you stand on top of it leaves us nowhere, to say one is twohundred years back and need to fix composition of sorts would be a better idea. And the need to consider the next 200 years is equally expancive, how exactly we can do that on earth, demands the intelligence somehow to take responsability. A mere bacterial growth putting containers to shop and skyscraper hives to live is not going to cut it..

There is not nothing because you are not thought anything. There is not nothing because you are not resisted. In lack of resistence comes responsability and the underlying fantasy and mythology, yes, allegoric of religion. In an age where nothing is treu, the innerly constructs and systems of nature and the skin of reality. green on trees, bleu skies, brown dirt. Those most essential to human understanding, become the primordial constructs from which to weave new allegoric systems. Modernism and its abstractions are a real Icarus, or even a new myth, where he is that dwelled to the sun, and found only darkness where he surpassed it. It is not treu that we know only time space and causality to begin with, if everything is an object to a subject then still some people have a numerous amount of Churches built for them, we don't simply efface that fact? Now if someone takes someone into this theory of the "subject" what do you get. And why on earth did it have to be a subject? Indeed it is contested in Black Metal and any movement that it has to be a subject. And now apparently it all has to go the anonymous, futile, unperceptual subjects ways. Anonymous building and stacking a matrix. Of which fiction can only create a nightmare to have lived there, indeed you will find few tales where it is stated as an ideal now. In The Mouth of Madness, Dark City, Pi, Wings Of Fame.

In that we can say family life is merely the womb of reality, art is the landscape of reality wherein the offspring enters.
We can rightly assume no society is other but created out of a dream. You create Churches or temple or Pyramid or bank societies out of a dream, Four options, and none is proven more then another. Especially not where esthetics is conserned the prior is preferred to the latter, and will be preffered always from now and to eterntiy. (A thing of which could not be doubted, and would be proven by now to Descartes) This society and its subject policy to provide the masses with an opinion that is not their own nor has any value, and the destruction thereof is deu, circle within, or bring without, there is no halfway venture out of here.

"-They don't want you to be superior, but they don't want you to lift them all up to aristocracy. -Then nothing exists but superior disgust untill they are all shoved into their palaces and esthetics and with it artists are recognized of purple blood beyond any possible impunity, ascribed in the Military fleets general quarters, and the schools and the banks and the hospitals. And if everything is just moronic and subjective, then THAT is truth and THEY can be subjective."

"We did n't come 40000 or 50000 years of ethics and beauty and self sacrifice at the very beginning of all possibilities to decide that mankind is a hunter gatherer ape and he can rot if he does n't work on the factory floor and make a living, where there is no other way then to shop for plastic wrapped bacon from industrial farms. Such a philosophy should be scrapped and its citizens reeducated."

From the decadence, the lightness of living. The lack of foundation upon the ergonomic principles of aristocracy, to the pragmatic view, which is inherently civil, and its architecture, and its novelties, the praciticality of living. Which then has to overcome the whole world, to the fact that it has no ideology but reduction to some kind of continuity of which bacteria have. Out of the mistaken concept of the subjectivity, that we can not agree, in which it agreed on nothing. And if you are an artist "you can go do that as a hobby somewhere, everything is subjective now we have the capitalist system, what a joke?! Whereas we now can clearly see we agree on allegory, as the subject is again a minimalist allegory. The nothing and the abstraction became the allegory on which modernism came to agree. Now a dead end, on which they agree. To have an ideal. Is now considered something, to pass by, indeed the statues, the bronzes, the classical of buildings and antiquity, they pass by, in what is very much a religion. A blind eye of the subject philosophy. How can we see a past that is a religion apart, cut off from our own. The modern dichotomies and polaraizations are the hysteria and the laste stage of subject philosophy, before the ideal again must build, where pragmatics wrecked it all. A usage simply for the sake of using a vision, is unfit, yes, classic, unless you consider modern and subject are religious dogma's in which a religious person ventured?! It is effectively impossible to get the classic back without assaulting those notions as religious?! Because they are?!

"It is not just so that modernism minimalism and modern architecture is ugly. It is part of a system concocted to tie people together to get along as everything would be "subjective" dispite any esthetic conviction, to see what they would do. And they fundamentally would defend and exterminate others and any beautiful species and contest it to the insanity of God and Lucifer both, just to tie together and have no merit, it is effectually an empty box; it only comes together because philosophers have debated the esthetic problem among eachother, have given up to live if there was no answer, and have found in their search nothing but rabble and idiots who actually could agree on nothing and built it into a religious system with its own cathedrals and its indifference they replaced with industry, their religion they replaced with advertising, rite and farming with watching a screen, games, sports, consuming itself. This deficit is then laurelled by some as the brilliant marvel of the modern world it is laurelled as our "aqcuired rights and values" yes i assume even "tastes"."
"miracles can actually exist if you consider that reality would really be a stone with a crack in it. What you see as the crack is where perception relates to the stone and where the stone relates to the crack." "Miracles throughout time, extraordinary poetic phenomenon or verifications of the "arch symbols" are of course parrallel you can't actually cause it. Its not catalytic as Jung Claimed. If you had no other option anymore then wait for that kind of a sign, then those ideals were planted and that sign confirms a beauty in providence opposed to the usual fart in providence that modernists believe and expect. Considering if we don't exist much longer, the vanity of a miracle consenting, or the spiritual, consenting to a man central, all of which are man central structures, is only refuted by that, other then that no principles of chaos are but allegories of chaos. "
If everything is subjective it leads to you as the subject to find its subjective. You can not get out of that spiral. If you have not anything, but with reason that you are dead and should be dead, that you are blind and the whole world exists only in you, and all others have different opinions? THen why would you need to agree on that? Why would you need to build a society on that?! Its everywhere? Why can I not disagree with that? Not only do i disagree, i find it utterly reprehensible you would then on the ground of theauthority of this common subject, to scoff people away as weirdo's into a forest somewhere having the moral high ground to indicate he is a little nuts and did n't belong in society?!

"If what a subject finds beautiful needs to be spouted into my face as "everything is subjective" about twenty times a day. Then what I find beautiful as Symbolist and nineteenth century academic and decorative art will be on all the commercial billboards of this earth. That is my right honour and privilige. Quid Pro Quo, I lived your world, now you live my world."

If the apocalyps is the sound of one fire, then i will see it beautiful and realized as the poets duty to respect and realize poems. And i will add to that apocalyps the majestic fumes of more thousands of fires.

its amazing how stupid a philosophy can seem if you would consider then rather "everything being subjective because i am a subject" basically that person would be wrong, as everthing is "objective and he is the object." in this world he presently had created. In the past everything seemed subjective but this is no longer treu. (You could offer different views on christianity or deviate from it, however you can hardly differ on the ongoing notions of minimalist art or the tendency to offer these childish, entirely sweet but entirely insufficient details on modern buildings, a detail to which the architect will point, entirely naive, yes, we should weep for him?! I have no intention of this being cynical, that is its beauty, in mankind being so gullable, in that lays its beauty, to commit atrocities but to still be a child, in that lies redemption and generosity to rule, which we SHOULD have found, but kept fighting, they did, naked, and rather oblivious to what would be drapes to adults, the intelligence, not in the least the course of mankind took the curtain that hid the stage away from mankind, and its play can be witness by everyone, if you want to sit in the tribune as I have.

I mean the subjective would be nice if there was a positivist reality.
But where does that positivist reality come from?
We have to assume it is based on the fact that people fart and there can not be eminence in religion, or genius in creation. We have to assume as Freud was a positivist, that the analysis of seeds and the all around wastefullness of seeds, as it was at that time started to be studied, meant that that was a random process. To deny anyone their destiny?! They deny destiny for there being atrocity. BUT that atrocity in any given case was partially the atrocity of industrial subject theory and subject hysteria itself. Much like the ongoing notion of chaos could be induced by computer bugs etc, a thing of which did n't exist in roman days.

I Preliminary manifesto and manifesto of a new artisan world

That everything is subjective is a little bit literal somehow. We all seen a kid and have generalities, like personal intersocial now archetypes, opposed to prophetic and imaginitive archetypes which you should be free of and use with inspiration which some lack, but anyway



Well i admit its not really the civil as it is the philosophy of general irony and "owh whatever" and more things the masses have now been educated into. Of which i was also once someone who suffered under it and thought what a worthless world. But to describe subjectivity as i do here is really to see the current state of defaitism and stupidity of the society itself, the system at its core. It should help to reevaluate, to keep an open mind and to have a new wave. And not be swept away in the main fallacy of the argument that is currently prevailing. When Kant gave the masses subjectivity it evolved into a mass system but we have to fight for our position here. As if not already considered that the whole system works against intellect and revolution, against pride, a notion entirely natural and also "the only notion i was bestowed that i was proud, to advance, to advance thinking" would n't have have to say that? And dignity "the only notion that i would, as yet dispite my faults, be considered to have an essence." Yet would n't christianity be of essential notion then and in that redeemable, rather then needs to be schewed for dogma or spiritual inclination, which spiritual people then pick up on the spiritual and not the positivist considerations within the classical spiritual considerations. And all that of classical sensations genocide to a level we have not seen before?! I mean consider this you go like "owh a boys band can be successfull, and not your intelligent manifest." then you go, well shit happens they once fought wars and died and you need to live up to something. But this does n't really go for this manifest????? Or rather. Is ANYONE willing to go to war and die on the beaches of D Day for THIS manifest? For a BOYS BAND? I mean i have no one to kill and i can't even be allowed, i have n't got a machine gun, they would lock me up in prison, and frankly i'm a bit squeemish myself to blow peoples brains out i don't like this blood squirting and despair??? Obviously if there was 'nt any tumult or if it was n't real and there was n't consequences and i would n't end up very alone I would be playing this computer game pretty easily. None the less i have walked out, I have been militant, You basically challange me to kill, "go on, go ahead, try it, then you can be one of us, one of the stars."
The civil are the weight, the joke that captivates arts, they fuckup any philosophy, they consider status rather then actual wealth to be primordial, they are the dialectics the philosopher and the artist always has to steer into another course. And then it will even denounce him while he does that. As far as walking through society, it is a DEAD weight, as far as it pays and builds it with its weight, it is the reason for the slow and injust proceeds with which the large boulder rolls on. Should we justify ourselves or be finally just? Not in the least. To them maybe. But there is n't reason to morals as much as there is n't a reason to justify woman or their rights, juxtaposed to the nobility of- and nobility of the compassion for- death and suffering. There is humility for people touting of their rights and being proponents of someones rights merely on the grounds someone GAVE YOU these rights, and they did n't come from you at all, you would have not been TOUGHT anything and they did n't come naturally. -Again, monarchs were any of the masses personalities. The masses as an indication would be the one to unscrupulously contribute to this society, and turn it into what it is, as the dead weight is key now, in stead of the arts the culture, the religion, religious leaders or monarchs building something or waging war, if one thought that in this time you could not speak of the masses i'm afraid on the contrary.
As they then frolic the careless minds, with new found vanity, the vanity without the notion of any grounds on which these rights can be contested, into the world, eager for sustenance, with the arrogance of a power now to choose who kisses them in a world where love nor commitment exist. -A consideration we consider without reserve, as opposed to the lack of esthetics of any male figure in this era, as it is not frail nor vain and only contests of competition conquest and boisturousness, convulsing in its energy and pride and agression, in a world that is not his, there is even something MORE beautiful then a modest and frail woman, a broken woman that simply wishes to die, that thinks this world is sick and rot of corruption, and does n't want any kind of relation at all. My an ESTHETIC, TRAGIC IDEAL, I must be a Christian after all?? Or a woman that starves herself, she would n't judge or cry out of indignation a single time, take an example to that.- So the rabbid modern youth with the mentality of an old aunt is to swallow them in that one modern myth, of dishes and laundry, strangling the relationship with their demands and standards, but with an equality now, be it known that that equality needs to have some standard of neatness and cleanliness. What beautiful serene victim once, what gorgous and holy slave and underserving suit for a sacred angel, as much as the emancipation of all that is wrecked, we find it natural to say it was more beautiful when it was wrecked, it was in that its beauty came out, and because this hideous loathsome whiny whore now, this holy relic of which apparently not even needs to have any laurels in artisan art, indeed the replacement of Christian truth with family life left family life bleak, unfit for deification into real art?! As much as Christianity is hardly even a family oriented cult. As such the victims exchange places with the corrupted, as much as the avant garde, keen fresh spirit, moves down a slope gathering more weight like a ball of snow and springs avelanche, modernism, before it comes to a halt, right now, and we see the devestation, this dialectical spirit, is only science, and as that which was once at the core of science is apart of vision, that what became civil, vision itself is the only dialectical solution to what becomes civil, and science will be no more. There is no justice, and he who in reason would find it would see it corrupted by the same dialectics of a dead weight, but a generosity that is only part of a few, and in only so much of his deeds, that is n't even a demand for us to state this or a demand to those who give humanity any new direction. If we do direct it, let us consider it would be corrupt and without morals. Merely formal, and inherently erotic and beautiful. Of that we can be sure, as no one today knows what that is, beauty, and alas, we can also be guaranteed it does no longer exist. So as far as its a mist of which is slipping through our fingers, we can also consider that if we knew what it was, we would bring it back from its elusive carcass in which it still exists, as a depression, a downturn, the symptoms of a degenerate world, cries to the heavens of despair, and it would n't be at all, mist, and this fog humanity has wondered into, of which is the carton board excreted of its lack of care. We are in the mist, so it does n't exist, is what they say, would they bother to not petrify it as they glance at it, and not petrify their glance and their very eye balls, but unify with it. And make its light comes to life, the daylight a clear sky. For that you do need to unify with it. Not "GO BACK" to it at all however. As the conservatives state. We do not say go back or just read the classics, we say unify and bring forth, in the first case of this I already found my unity, of course the second case scenario on offer, i don't know why any of most peoples argumenst would be valuable and why you would n't let an artist and philosopher on the stage?!
Then a scientist will say, in the jungle one out of ten superstition and to see things somewhere, saved him, nine times nothing happened. On the contrary, it is part of that need for a symmetry. A meaning we can give, that it was also given to us, as we started looking, we felt the need for something to look back. And that experiment, this amorous need can not, and has never been sacrificed, nor could it be sacrificed by science, as it looks only in one direction, where it is not, as apart of inspiration opposed to the scientific method, not then to the nine parts out of ten in reality where it does not exist, that artists make up only one out of ten? Where we contrary people would consider still we rather be in a world of deluding ourselves, but to the abundance of imagination that it oversimplifies with an entertaining notion, rather but a serenity and a warmth of, indeed, generous, forthcoming and deep "syllogistical" imagination, of which could be some kind of allegory. The one notion of which it moves us to deify, is the notion indeed that nature moves us as a child would move us, simple and sincere it offers us a treat of a naive beauty. And these scientists say 1 out of ten times it was amazing but we DO NOT COUNT THAT?! Its like saying to a child magick does n't exist. What i'm saying is first of all that adulthood surely is IMPOSSIBLE, a thing of which incidentally was fully revealed by some sign to pull me out, not pull me in anywhere, as nothing is capable to pull me in. It is only indicative of how simple the allegories were that enchained the Christians, such as this "epic" moment he would fall under his cross, not once not two times etc. And then we are concerned we have to keep it simple again for this lot that resides in the main alley of the church, and of which have now taken all the media, business and the polical sphere by storm. Which is contested here that the masses is the media, that it is the politicians, that it is the rich. Of which classics surely are n't masses, to the masses and to this world they are forgotten, and the consensus is, that you can IDENTIFY with them. And that creates a very bleak present. We could say this subjectivity, has opened the flood gates. If pop music will say, in this modern satanic stance, withered itself this satanism in this individualism, that you "do what you want" some will likely find themselves wanting to become politicians or businessman, but eventually nobody will really know what they are doing. Because we have forgotten the most we preach to is dead weight, the subjectivity and its 200 year development then is the WORST course to take. And we see that in the emptyness (the carton board and plastered up imagination) of doing what one wants. What this would then do is irradicate the modern subjectity nihilism and science and open discussion and not in the least the arts to an actual debate, we have only proven a point if we consider subjectitity builds the structure and is detrimental as it is today for esthetic standards. What those subjective standards can be can be DEBATED, but not in the least we can say it is SUBJECTIVE, because then nothing is debated and everything will be the same as it is now, it is now considerably superficial. Here we build the groundwork on what is conceptual, we will again try to have words attach to form (as in the modern debate they detached deu to the hysteria, in which they all became obsolete and driving us stark raving mad) and we have to consider in that, again as core to the system here, there is the conceptual, industrial, barren skeleton, there is the kitsh which is part of nature and myth. And the numerous interrelated qualities like false sealings, plaster, mockups, prelimenary, rudimentary, etc. If you reject this manifest being usefull where it makes architecture, sculpture, the formal as the course to take, in a world where this lack of solid equipment to describe a physics and metaphysics leads to this age of frustration, of tedious rabbid anger of just ranting ones individual emotions being wronged always. Solid equipment to describe Physics or Metaphysics leads to hysteria, left to fester under the advertising hypercivility speaking to the mediocre family value which somewhere still blooms. This lack of Physics, essence of truth in what is said then leads to irony, which is a word to describe a despair of all things rediculous and overtly detrimental to sensibility, black humor in reverse you could say. Ahhhh its JUST this value man, so its NOT this value, parrallel with something like, frivolous humor or, putting a bucket on the head of a man in a diaper and a mob in his hand, or indicative also to modern comics as far as they relate to mythology and religion, the age more likely, of irony, or the polar opposite to religion, as its democracy a polar opposite exactly of Ancient reigns. Not however in any way more functional or more valuable, not in any way less genocidal if we would ask the fish, for which i have no fear to go to any fish and be asked, and be moved by the truth of it. TO ask is art. TO KNOW is prophecy, if i can hear a fish, is your geuss, perpetually your GEUSS. Something, this irony, as the metaphysics opposed to the irony proves, and the religion which anything becomes which is essentially the last argument and the ultimate argument for the complete decay, and very dear to society and science at large.
Nihilisms eerie vacuum calls the emptyness of modern life and its guardians to the forefront of where eventually then beauties sentimentality must be defended against the ordinary, where also a virtuosity must be comprized that tackles the ordinaries belittling of their and others presumed passions so little and nervous, of whom are children to presume all are children and mock the most blatant or grotesque sentiments and experiences. You can say of us we are children, but in that mature, mature, in that children, there is no other way, but to be mature, but contesting of being poisoned, and poisoned, being mature, well there is no course for that, tell Descartes that for a fact. Which is the contestation i'm making he did n't know that yet. If you believe in nothing at all, and have the ordinary win. I will believe in demons with more fervor untill I am immersed in this anti civil evil. or the urge to construct something, in the pervading ideology and dogma of lifelessness. (If i consider how stuck i am in society i definatly believe in demons as i gladly admit.) As it is at the source of darkness you drink when you need to realize light needs to exist, and with so little light you need to drink of absolute darkness. There is an abundance of irony at the indulgence of sentimental beauty, so we have no reservation to have their world all resolved and obliterated. We can lift ourselves up with an argumented critique of anything, as we like to indulge in life, the tiresome discarding of all meaning, is a lack of indulgence in the awareness of life, and that is language and meaning. There is no greater meaning in life then to be constructive with it, there is no greater meaning in awareness then to be constructive with it. To build awareness on top of man, not to throw away the man under the awareness. Because if you throw him away, all the angels of heaven will fall into darkness. And must come back somehow somewhere marching from that dark, and likely now, we will have to bring the darkness with us. Likely then, a restoration of humanity will not come without many demons. more sculptures then for that.
And when those who have a tiresome religion of existential dread, that they did n't create nor bother to look for in older books, have but one goal finally but to drive you to suicide as you can't believe a word you are saying. To be at their expence, to be tired of them, yes take their weight, a load to carry and a use for us. Never the meaning of their burden. As it has none. As they are just tired. And trying to spread their ideology as the most basic life has no reservation no matter how decrepid and humble or inferior. And when the first demand, for there to be something constructive, is fulfilled, we can look at the second demand, the carefull nuanciation in which we construct. And then we have cast away a present civilisation, a normality in anguish over the absence of any other ideal. On which they clasp their last ounces of awareness and defend it against the grand and promising delusions of beauty.

Modern society is an inside out, microscopy, gyenecology, brain surgery. We are not interested in that, we are interested in the mere skin of reality where passions and emotions mean something and where they perpetually attach to. We have established truth only to ponder, we have heard established truths only to ponder our rebellion, as always, and we have been hearing more established truths when we have rebelled, over which we ponder, and finally, this age falls over like a stack of cards. My revolt was mere compressed against the breaches of ordinary reality, and held back by my duties, of which are artistic and philosophical alone. I am extremely passive, as yet i walked alone here, with a lot commonly agreed to celebrate mutual morals and values, and i have raised and axe, and killed no one, but over raising and ae, society is so justifiably appalled, it is entirely comical to me, and it is justifiable in that you have a social consensus, it is comical as you have no cleu how abberent your consensus really is.
This manifest conserns the paradox that today they are all bloating "owh in medieval days, the banks were controlled by the kings." yes well what would they rather be led by? Bankers so you get office buildings? Kings built castles yes. This modern bloating is subjectivism, essentially Matrix movies are also subjectivism, does n't say anything, it does not get out, it does not have a vision. It has only a critique on the past whereas it does n't provide an esthetic of living. Hence all the office buildings and minimalism. You let the digits create the state. In essence there are no more positive visionary manifests novels or myths. Which allows only for a subject state to be created, to see that and discover the paradox of that you must study it in depth here. But of course this subject world was inevitable as the main theory of Kant did n't have everyone to "think for themselves" no as a matter of fact they did no such thing they concentrated on the subject problem. This leaves the masses completely unaware going "owh you believe in God" "Owh you believe in satan." "Owh you believe in beauty" "Owh everything is subjective" this is all they can say without leading to the real problem that these arguments are just trodding down on what you create. Of course you believe in satan, what you going to believe in? Office buildings? Of course you believe in god. What you going to believe in? Office buildings? Of course you believe. Etc, their arguments only get the same world they have. nothing. That includes the, "do what thou wilt." We propose the only solutions here are the variation into such subject effacing details as what is imagination, beauty, and artisan quality. The only answers to this debate is to concider the esthetic principles of kitsh and concept. Therefore here we don't actually treat of the usual, religion bad, religion good etc. We recognize there IS religion, We asses here what that is. We then regard its a personal feeling, with a tragic quality. Whereas the faulty errors of religion were kept, the essence of masses being masses. Whereas modern imagination is subject imagination. Its terribly exciting for the masses, but it does have a lack of tragic quality or serenity of any kind. That it would n't be a religion is contested since it comes with its own kind of irony, life attitude and societal structure. We live, in the subject religion. It should be known that it does n't adress the visionary, heroic subject it treats always of the subject problem, the ironic, which is a concept about the "we are "just" here in stead of the "We are here." and the "We truly treasure existence, our nature and the nature we live in." This where it is embraced only for the base commercial and civil character of it, no deity which again, lives in the imagination as more profound considering its tragic. I consider this subject then makes change, ecological awareness and action, religion and esthetics impossible and it is also why it was embraced. Sadly. We can can see you can not get out anymore, you are ready for the delusions now. I mean if you then say. "I am a subject" they will then say "Yes but everything is subjective" etc etc. This system, that has been everyones system for 200 years can be completely discarded, it has come to its expiration date. Because from this whole thread and indeed if we analyze The distopia novels and movies, Adolf hitler and the modern authority of left wing ideas. And apply this system, we consider there is very little we can still do with it. And there is very little argument that thinks out of the box. What happens here is that this society in no way becomes anywhere close to the measure we would like to have for a society. Whereas today they think we only need to tinker with it. It leaves for a desperate gap of what is desirable. Likewise we can then consider "they are poor" well what is poor? I am reasonably poor but I do not or no one should mourn for not having twenty spatula's and two stoves two cars etc. We now believe that the essence, which is a third world country, should be enriched by slick fancy hospitals, neat cleaned corridors, we need to be forced insurances and blood tests and cancer tests, fancy office buildings, shopping malls and shelves stuffed with food. -The third world has more of that then they even realize, of garbage I mean.- And then they wonder why everyone is fat?? The fact of the matter is to be "poor" like this is the least of everyones concern. One can have artisan esthetics furbished to that life, which would make one a very classical and worthwhile civilisation. (And would make me perfectly happy if i had my kin, painting and sculpting is rewarding to my taste fine enough.) You could have a serene religion of some kind. Which could also comfort one. But one does n't need modernism. We can say Latex, Chokers and a little gadget or a screen that is interactive are the only worthwhile inventions, (apart from lesbians) it took a while. It put a large weight on the structure in all kinds of form and it was used in excess so that it seems an enormous leverage. But to our senses this really means very little. In previous papers and letters to the academy, where I started to get out of the crisis of the "subject" and started to move out of this pleb religion and dogmatism today I then started to theorize how the senses are infinatly bound to nature and artisan art, and the essence of technology was really a bubble around that, allowing us to one day, sculpt angels of clay and cast them in gold, IN SPACE, and build castles on the moon. However to do that and to change the elementary structure of society and the consensus on modern art and minimalism. You need to destroy the subjectivity. You need to consider it a religion that mainly dogmatizes in all modern arguments and imagination, as it IS advertising and as it IS modern entertainment. And then, since we have nothing left of these brilliant systems of the enlightenment if we do that and risk folding away into our own minds, we need to get OUT, and this will lead to ACTION and a thousandfold TONNAGE of progress. And actual wealth, of which billionaires today have very little, measured in the novel and luxurious as innovative arts truly is. We also conclude that the greatest good and solace in life is not to have money, but to compose with it. Is not to have renters, but to compose to a dignified aristocratic structure, of which we now see and will also treat here; "No king has ever had bleu personality" As a matter of fact. "They treated of every personality available in the plebs." However, they did have the responsability and dignity of kings. Decadence or failed kings is not the issue. They were kings. And they were personalities. if we ever mean to evolve it is not the cynical subject consideration but that, in a recognition of our esthetic sense, our decadence levels and our urge to sin and our sense of lust and our scent. We are kings. The enlightenment basically said, the king supresses us, let us all be civil. Whereas it should have been rather reversed, Let us try to be more NOBLE! The notion of the masses coming after the leader also is a strict subject feature of modern age. In fact and as has evolved to this very day, the leader means very little. Other then be a mekka or a urinal, the structural deficit is usually not the leader. As little as the Caesecu's could be blamed for deficits in the labour and agrecultural market. Hardly anyone even knew what the structure was doing, and even here is me saying it should n't have sufficed anyone at all. Why would a caescescu, apart from those actual crimes of his reign, not be considered a martyr. He was human? Why does he always needs to be a criminal? Why are the people who lynched him are never criminals? Why were his subordinates never criminals, its part of a deification of leaders, not of a reality about them, they are not even real? How can it in a truly subjective world be possible to have a leader? The rich today could be blamed for the spatula's depleting the earths resources, it is usually a question of FAITH. And it is here where the masses CAN be blamed, a genius would be open minded, and resolve problems in generosity. Whereas a pleb would troll and whine, and take for himself or see his own benefit. Whether this is the essence of human nature is not so sure. If most people are like that is not so sure. If martyrs exist they can be perfectly self sacrificial. They have done. I insist in the era of subjectivity dogma we have to be once more. And if we would consider that is treu. Why did medieval knights die on battle fields? Why did anyone ever take the lead in a fight? Why? Where the churches ever built? Why did those knights uncontestably rode to their glory, to their death? And why is it? That there are actually monks and nuns. Delusions? But of which this is also a delusion, the fact that you can't escape, and the detailing of what reality does have to offer, and what is worth dying for?! On the contrary now they even say, life renders all pleasures useless, in the past they would have said this purpose is worth dying for?! These causal. Evolutionary debasements of everything you will ever learn about mankind in school books are only half of what is presented in history. Then the very formal and conceptual of the language provides the bulk of the lack of identification. Immanuels notion that categories should imply behavior for all but its inherently selfish refutes millions of soldiers and knights actions, heroism, etc, of we now can only deem it trivial to our general concept of reality. A concept which in its turn is entirely trivial and made of every artisan artefact a mere scrummy icon in some merry go round planet. Because of what? A sun burst could burn us suddenly? I imagine you would need to get heroic then and find some solutions and get to other planets faster but just to sit there whining will not amount to much. It is not indicative, not is this age indicative, of greatness. We live in a debased age. And we, with subjecttivity and evolutionary perspective, have a tendency to debase life and history. Which makes it impossible to escape the advertising, entertainment and office building and bank and hive mentality. What we then often say is hey. "Napoleon saw a little red man he was crazy" what the subject does is then equate this to normal behavior and demeans any myth to that of a "subject" which is "diseased" on the contrary we can say this little red man is more of a modernist mythology then ever. We just say; "he is insane." and our answer we then state is. "Everything is subjective" and say then that. "therefore there can not be God, ghosts, or any "metaphysical" entity. We then would consider that it is mere redundant subjectivity, and selfishness, positivist arguments should prevail for. "A little red man, if you saw it, it would n't fall in line in what the "subject" finds treu, hence we contest that the subject formula contested with anything of that which EXISTS as religion and spirituality or mere illusions or delusions. In effect it created a culture. So how is that not absurd? Where i state that the imagination very much exists and has a "sway" into a coherence where it does become more meaningfull. Therefore we argue that whereas it is a esthetic vision to the future, it is deemed kitsh. And where it conserns distoptian nightmares we consider that (mostly literary) art. But that means it is only artistic to live in distopian nightmares because for now an actual world that we have to create on Mars or here on earth is actually on the horizon. Therefore the Utopia has to come back into literature. The ethics of esthetics must come back, rather then just always come back to the "subjective". We can safely assume, when we learn of what this "subjective" did to society. That nothing at all is subjective and there is a lot more to it. We tend to want to agree and choose to conversate on esthetics, this general consensus has with billions of sermons organized a dead end society, there is not just one culprit, surely Kant can be named, Mies Van Rohe can be named, and surely the very lack of notion of these and the free exploitation and invocation of modernity is who we would call masses, and the people who defend this society could be then seen as utterly misguided. When we believe in beauty or God there is an entirely different system of living organized. And when we believe in the "subjective" this is it. And all is perpetually lost with this that notion. Right now people even state "if napoleon had moved another step this way" then history would have been dramatically different. This goes for every word you speak, including the subjective theory of immanuel Kant one day that dramatically changed landscape and politics. Which means that the subjectivity. Does not actually exist. It is a black hole of philosophy. With which then the authorities or any vested interest will say, and indeed believes this namely that; "Yes but morals are inherently subjective." And this will then lead to the automated expansion of bank accounts as citizens and suburbs and garbage to suffice the masses etc. In effect we must learn to COMPOSE. A bank account is inherently detrimental if you had not COMPOSED with it, as it is a pencil to society. To say everything is subjective is to consider the world does n't exist and you stacked a lot of numbers on a bank account. In the same veign there is the Guiness book of world records, lotteries, and more averages and exceptionalities to account for the fact that something needs to be scientifically verifiable to be exeptional. But this only considers records of inferior light of which to compose entire cities, to COMPOSE must be in a more dignified and serious light. After all nature and reality as creators as God or Gods, are not actually as ironic nor inherently possess the quality of being ironic as people might think. Reality, a sun, a God, is very serious, and if you want to make a city, an artwork, an argument, you should not just consider "ahh everything is subjective, whatever" Subjects, of who'm are never heard of, may have that fortune. An intelligent person, or coming to think everyone today taking a slice of the ether, has influence, therefore the subjective of which is merely ironic today, and of which merely irony is left of it. Has to be discarded for the merit of the features of composition and the standards of it. Which also can be verified, not over the past hundred years, but explicitally over all of human history. We do no longer live in modernism. Where it is keen to conceputalize all of history. And create a little bubble; The vaults to the past and its myth and esthetics are again opened. Not in the least a renaissence and a Mars conquest will result of that, much like the renaissence of the past and the discovery of the Americas. Therefore in the notion to "compose" we have found the great mover of things, more then ever it will appear it is us and our very philosophy of which every word is important. And creates ripples throughout, the last notion you need then is to state. "everything is subjective" but also the last thing you need is to state for instance a comic or a boys band is all part of "subjective culture" well that depends on how many girls you want to drive into suicide as they can clearly get more pathetic with the vanity of them. They have been known to take fame much more lightly for a much longer time then you might expect. Fame is in essence a very female, make up and show ones behind virtue, whereas glory, to sacrfice and find no other recognition, is very much a mans virtue. Now it is not my notion that this is applicable to all, it is my notion that it is applicable to the average, and that we should strive to extreme nobility. Artists have, but needed not. Woman have been poetesse in leasure, but could have been fighters, some fighters could have been poetesse in leasure, and what of it should they be fighters to aqcuire the glory or the vanity of man, to be strong and to defy? The fact that everything today is "subjective" destroys the very value of which you would drag them off stage and let them practice a more serious job, say. Build a cathedral for a prophet. That we don't do that then is not simply because we have "evolved into a culture who considers everything individually." No, it is entirely something else. In fact individuality and personality especially, the "soul" also, and therefore factual subjectivity, goes away by stating it as a fact. And that does not mean "it is aliens" because i stated "it is something "else". Here in this manifest at least, you will know what to express once you have again lacked a conviction and not defeated the entire subject culture. The laissez faire will just build a "ding an sich" out of things. What I am saying is that throw away furniture constitutes as much a religion as a catholic church, and the current course is to consume the earth. If all has to be subjective. Now it can be stated that without the furniture all the trees would be cut already, and most be done in terribly bad taste, other then that to everyone NEEDING a closet is detrimental. Anyone who identifies with modern wealth, modern culture, has basically the Duchamp Urinal as his Mekka. Of which. What we now know, is NOT a more worthwhile or treu notion then Mekka or Christ. We verify religion and esthetics through the notion that, if we do not, we still do it, be it for pathetic effects. We verify essentially the variety of esthetics concepts in God and artisan beauty and decorative art definatly OVER subjective notions. If we don't do that, we build a ding and sich. Which is probably robots doing everything and everyone in a container fed coca cola intravenuously and every belief stuck in a psychiatry. And entirely unmotivated or abstractions left of religion. What is felt deeply. Is that certain arguments not taken seriously, will lead for the ongoing development of the stupification of culture. It is not treu that irony is a killer, Irony, indeed kills, BE CAREFULL, the joke may be on you. At one point you will need to build. And currently, the establishment built a big yellow duck as a society. AGAIN, do YOU want to be apart of it? Then we feel your laughter is very corrupt. When you celebrate society dying. It will be we who laugh loudest, not people with light hearts thinking this is just a mere random passage and absorbed that as an entire religion to the freedom of their whim to do what they want and not fight for something. These people with their feet on the salon table, thinking every commercial should make it more convenient are the treu problem in this world.

For now, as caesescu was taken out of his palace and lynched. This manifest simply treats of the ardent conviction, that the military and everyone capable. Will end this charade, and get some people to compose a serious society. Alternatives will be concidered and should grow on this site. A simple "fuckthissite" will not suffice. This would simply be a lost pleb thinking nothing serious ever needs to be considered and hysterical mass convictions like "we don't need to care, the democracy has got it" is an imbecilic statement. "the democracy has not got it, because no one cares" and the christian notion will contest "the majority needs to be mobilized by the minority. then we also know here and now that "the majority today renders the ardent and militant as obsolete" They seem to get it all right. Then we hear comedians say "why can't we just have a good laugh anymore" well without this you are indeed laughing in the wrong veign. You are laughing in the wrong direction. I laugh at modern society and i also spit at it and at my psychiatrists. Why that is Should already be clear to some extent. Why i should n't be corrupt or injust is not entirely clear, whereas it is only then proven that one found his right to exist?! In a prison cell. Equally it is not entirely clear how else i would prove to a psychiatrist his cages are the new Saint Pieters If i do not also paint his cages and get them removed, or threatened repercussions, i should paint them again so many times, that of which would be considered my DUTY yes!! There are duties then!! Of which artists have occasionally felt the brutality of them in their hearts, of which i mean to laurel them, not regard a second on idiotic pop stars their aqcuisition of a right as if the world world should spout confetti on their coronation day having beside that a whole planet which is ecologically and culturally rot; Not only are no ideas capable to be dilligent and to surface, other then grind against the global mockery and the millions of voices, also it is a question who will advocate loud and clear the radical demands, of which currently are but children. "The next generation" as the generations as apart of subjectivity all say. because of course, if everything is subjective it can't be you. As the beings furthest away from man are most good. So are the next generations, but then, you always throw them away once they become mature if their is no duty or a right for ecology or nature, a right for esthetics or esthetic culture. In effect, it revolves only around ONE SELF. To consider the notion that the outer beings are the GOOD would indicate one self as pure evil. To indicate That it is subjective, merely identified that we needed to know the object, of which most people, as they are limited, proclaimed we only needed to know the subject. And that would be ourselves. This is then still contested by the fact they consume. In many cases the cult of the self is a nurturing of consumption, a celbration as a celbration of the vacuosity of that philosophy, not because the world is essentialy vacuous, but then that would be rather a statement, not a question. A presumption which we should have, stated with the reservation exactly that it is corrupt, as the Marquis De Sade did, then proved himself he was not as corrupt, as he let people go from his trials without sending them to the guillotine, of which a despaired plebeian and the hysteria of today would not easily have contested. Most people are hypocrites, he was the opposite of that then. In stating the ultimate crime, creating the ultimate marvel of death and not doing it, you could absolve yourself from some things then. We assume merely on the ferocity of what you stated, and the frailty which you were contested of. A feat of which also requires patience and the least amount of corruption any moral touter will not be aware of to the least extent. He boldy finds out about all the shaming boys that Goethe and The monarch indulged in, and will not resent in making that fact into the new religion, these people have always done that, we can read about it.


The castle Neuschwanstein and the romantics and art nouveau already dealt with kitsh. It was n't developed properly and degraded into cosplay and role play, and the conceptual evolved over it and won. Both kitsh and concept run dead. To get perpetually more irony out and more beauty into society should be part of the ecologic and esthetic reality. To keep crafting and fighting our way out of the ultimate deficit which is modernism to be noted minimalism and conceptualism, and irony. In a world where there is no conviction, the material goods kitsh and concept become the only relevant object realities, the only things we can develop and debate on. For that you need to perceive the whole of the past 200 years and redevelop it.
With the irony that all that matters in life is really war and religious dogma, and there is no other point to it. We now need a pluralist conception of esthetics, living and composing in our own world, where it is "rediculous", we craft it, and grow more serious, where it is "conceptual", we can use decoration and allegory. And transform "abstract" notions into allegory, where they transformed classic notions into abstractions. In the mathematics of images feeling a deeper perspective of melancholy, hate, art, etc, we are provided our only meaning. It is this or insanity. We can build all minimalist cannisters and have simple posters in stead of paintings in it, stuff it with our own interests. "Drink beer and eat pizza!" Basically everything else would be considered kitsh. If you have this for everyone its the only meaning, and even THAT is ultimatly kitsh. As ergonomics or modern life is all just as useless, to state otherwise, and not be a vegetarian is completely fascistic. Hence someone needs his kitsh you might argue. So whereas you can laugh taking beauty seriously. You may laugh at pizza's and beer basics just as well. We are rediculous yes, we are living, we are not in physical torment or despair. Hence a rebuilding of esthetics and ritual under the whole libertine irony that all is useless is the only way out. Composing the useless is effectivaly esthetic and an act of pure counsciouss. To be alive without bereavement is an artistic state. To survive it without the need for polarization or nihilism is not easy or impossible without art. Schopenhauer said the solution was art, Camus said the only philosophical problem was suicide, they EVOLVED the problem and this led to modernism. But both life as suicide and contemplating it is art, as it is life. You can not develop modernism, You can only take a step back and develop the precursors to modernism, treat them in a different way. Not just plunge into the cliff of nihilism like they all did, and deconstruct the whole philosophy over and deeper again.

That religious dogma proves to be the only sensation of truth a person has is absurd, Kant said the ONLY thing we know is the object to a subject. But we basically now know of kitsh and concept. An allegoric meaning, or a minimal idea; synthesis and acceptence of both is key. Integration of technology and idea into a solid, not kitshy esthetics. Or at least a new course of kitsh, robed in more classical substance. To indeed apreciate the naive of what is faulty in a naive painting, or robe the naive rather more often in the correct artisan process. It could be that a man who paints is told "everything is subjective", but another ones (actual) opinion is that he should pick up mosaics as he would be wonderfull in that. If he is held by the prior he would be totally lost as a society could be lost in that. We emancipate all the subjects as we can talk about the forms now opposing eachother. Artisan reality opposed to the reality of machine made and simple idea.
That functionality and money and ergonomics is the only thing that matters, and suicide is the only philosophical problem left is simply not treu. In medieval times and any age before modernism about 40 percent of any city was decorative religious art. By means of faith you can build any society. There is no need to simply ignore the power of allegorical and mythical creation and build empty theaters with plays on our existential crisis. The crisis of dogma was explicitly created out of the crisis of being "just an individual in an indifferent and unfounded world not central to humanity" and the religious dogma had every philosopher from 200 years on repeat that? Now we are all left as individuals with only THAT philosophy. Which is kind of a paradox. We need to emancipate any individual taste as it is richess and decoratively makes plentyfull, in a world where there is only nature and faith in arts. And the female body among others, nature and animals ARE indeed central to composition. THE MIND as a female body, its IRRATIONALITY, where we emancipate or see anything emancipated we demand dignity and generosity. The whole theory of the enlightenment would basically say 'the sun does n't revolve around us so we are inferior to the other side of the universe, which is entirely empty dark and useless" even the "object to elude us, and the thing at itself being metaphysics, on which we can not communicate" seems to me to contradict the notion that. "Everything is then subjective" As it leaves no logical other outcome to begin with let alone a position at all to "think for yourself" which i assure people i can effectively do. I don't belong here?! As much it is considered "the king is not legitimate, so we are inferior as no one is the king." It even states "there was never any king" to weed out the disease, and we need to be inferior to it. But we weeded it out for sure. Now then we need to provide these inferior beings everywhere with plastic angels, which treats of an allegory for sure, with romantic couples on benches in Bavarian clothing. Or with a statue of Louis the fourteenth, irony to who can see it, perhaps its cynical on their part cause he was NOT the one who was decapitated. Rather unconstructive and naive to me still. Besides if you offer them a sculpture worth millions they can not see it. Or its sent back because plaster comes off. The ultimate solution is then that within consumption as customers we are kings, develop containers where we can all shove food in our faces because "that is kingship" We argue everyone is part of the aristocracy. We evolve and have plenty to look back at, and further our world and decorate our world with, we do not DEVOLVE. I mean to make matters worse Marx considered Suffice the masses with food and goods, no one is saying anything about allegoric meaning and art. Its not because there is religious dogma and every allegory always has to be "treu" that the story of deities has no allegoric worth?? We can FEEL a truth in it which is, and here Kant was right, perpetually our own choice. But is not as Kant tried to enforce a new religious dogma, perpetually unkown, as we would start to "believe" that, and clearly today "realize" that. Thus the only truth is faith. Faith is naturally the individuation of religion, thats where it comes down to YOU. Even suicide is just faith. It can be anything, it can be nothing, the question is, if you want that to be your merry society, or other things today considered, if you want that to be your merry society, you have a serious psychological problem?! And someone to have given you a dogma. But a dogma out of Kant leads to modernism. It is entirely lucid to consider this manifest solves that debate and that problem, and solves a momentary impasse the culture of Kant has suckered into. Gothic, Black Metal, Steampunk, Martial industrial and Dungeon Synth are at the forefront to establish an ideology considering, if this modern society to have unfounded esthetics, shitty cities, lack of esthetics is treu, then there can only be an esthetic world without it, it developed the negative of ideology, as much as it is the logical end of Kant, as much as surrealism, fascism and communism conceptualism and minimalism was. If a cup is a little kitshy, then surely it needs to be discarded but enhanced, no reason to throw out the child with the bathwater. Which is what conceptualists do.
Hamburgers and a infinate range of sugardrinks were as much the end Of kant besides, for there to be only "chickens, cows sheep and pigs" left of earth. The chickens known to be in dark obscured hangars the cows slaughtered industrially. Thus to leave meaning to the individual under a religious dogma of commerce is entirely faulty, not only is it demoralizing, it is itself a stagnation of an entirely faulty theory. Maybe it is a culturally self evident thing that thoughts need to be wrong, and considered wrong over time. And a natural process for us to have to go back at a certain time. kapitalism is basically the blood circuit in a body, its basically what every society consisted of, trade, but its not much use on itself. You need skin, (esthetics) a head, (leadership) eyes (a philosophy) ears (pluralism) bones (principles honour and glory.) Muscles (craftsman and labour) And for that manner a sword (militance to composition) and A VAGINA which would indicate you state OUTWARDS and for that matter INTO SPACE not the other way around. This whole "fucking" and "sperm" culture opposed to the composure and militance, besides that defecation can hardly be considered ethical based on its own validations. If you HAVE NO DIGNITY?! NO INSPIRATION?! LOOK FOR AN EXCUSE, INSPIRATION ART AND DIGNITY IS KEY, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, YOU DO NOT FIND NO REASON TO BE DIGNIFIED AND INSPIRED AND TO HAVE NO RESPECT OR SYMPATHY FOR THE ARTS. Not EVERYTHING is finally SUBJECTIVE AT ALL?! It would seem rather scientific that people are a closed cannister of care. They only have a certain amount available, which sort of explains why there is a lot of consumption, and very little words and vocabulary of the classics, as the first did n't have all that much and needed to care and write beautiful letters and such. Whereas today only consumption seems to be agreed upon, and it does tamper with the amount of care, and it does enhance the debate into cynicism somewhat. This manifest might therefore help to certify a more profound spirituality. it is only a manual on HOW to find it, it is not a matter of spirituality itself even if some center of architecture and arts is proposed as we can do that anywhere as there is basically none of it today. You CAN mythologize something, build a stronger myth out of something, which in turn would see to respect something more and create stories and esthetics, that is not entirely scientific, it is not very religious either, if not art was your highest and nothingness was your lowest denominators, but NOT immoral?! At least I would hope? As yet no one today wants to consider it or consider it a way out of modernism?! You DEmystify, DEconstruct everything untill you have a pile of bones and bacteria left. Something tells me science and all that for a philosophy is just the wrong ATTITUDE rather then a solid philosophical base of culture. This machine is to unite creative dreamers under ALL art projects that already gathered a lot of support in the underground. The seperation of these artists from the architecture of supermarkets, banks, cinema's, hotels, skyscrapers etc is the whole essence of modernism and needs to change to change this world. The establishment gets away with but modernism on a purely hyerarchical basis on people who are indoctrinated by the education system, many take another course and have nothing to do with building banks or a domesticated twat house with a double garage and a small civil garden. I mean lets not live like that for a thousand more years, lets not build these basic and idiotic key on the door drought mansions everywhere. The bureacracy seems to only allow for ruin and boredome. Underneath is a masses with 80 percent not agreeing with present day modern conceptual and minimalist architecture, the debate is clearly fixed and fraudulent. The current "progressives" hold a sealing over all that is beautiful and classic because you can't "talk about it". Probably if it gets in the paper indeed a lot of people will "talk about it" in the "modernist fashion" thats not what makes an object beautiful at all. Maybe you could learn to "talk" in another "fashion" when you read a letter of Byron, if you read De Goncourt, or Schopenhauer. But then again I would certainly build in a critique on them.
What i'm doing is by means of this "subjectivity" to establish modern psychology.of peoples culture and analyze their arts. Hence "entertainment" was never considered before the enlightenment because it is a "ironic" consideration upon the assumed "lack of objective" value. I'm saying THAT is a consensus, why would n't you take the romantics or for that matter religious or mythologic truths to be more earnestly respected in some? WHy would n't it be the duty of Hollywood then to respect and to give an eminance to Egyptian mythology? Why would n't Art Deco be an interesting value in culture? NO it HAS to be... "subjective" see what i'm saying now?
This notion developed basically as the subjective as a subtraction out of a random chaotic whole is based on shit and sex. Why the Occult and Sade and Nietzsche and Hitler for that matter are particularly nasty, including the atrocity into their philosophy as it has to be all or nothing. Christ did n't make that mistake. Kings of past times did n't NECESARILLY make that mistake. I'm sure even Ludwig the II be lynched by now if he lived today but i'm sure then also you can be so consequent to break down Neuschwanstein AND Disneyland?! Also in Christs philosophy there is room for the "miracle" which is the antidote to the "hellish terrors" Existence is a test. In that at least it made a polarization of good and evil. Modern society believes in shit and sex alone. There can be no dignity or anything of the sort as that would be part of hypocrisy and or fascism.
To modern man, a dove shits, but in all my argumentations against them, i never had someone say. "Its just beautiful."
Because modern mankind, is a very autistic indidivual, very much a Freudian creation, secluded in all its eagerness for a metaphyics it by some means of error had extinguished. The prophets here aqcuired a Lessaiz Faire and a scrutiny and started wondering "what am i" "what is this being exactly" to describe the paradox of that surely should end it in other ways then the nakedness we aqcuire by the assumption of ALL BUT ART?!
There can be only one way; the fact that I had a white dove at my window, makes me believe this is a spiritual sign, and for that i need to get this theory out, and consider i was roaming for ten years in total anxiety, reading the theory of relativity and did n't know what to do with it. I should apologize for all the atrocity. Which I was incapable of preventing. As i was IGNORED and DEVaLUED as somehow an insigificant but none the less freaky being which we should seriously worry about and inject with all kinds of abstract substances . But basically my loyalty lies with creating wars with the sword again, having few people actually killed, (people of who'm i will mourn and build lavish sculptures none the less) and definatly not children. THat that is a truth, which also comes out of this manifest as an argumentation, not in the least IDENTIFIED AND CERTIFIED by a white dove, that should n't really even matter.
Not even saying sex equates to shit as such.
Sex is more like the highest well, orgiastic, releaving oneself to some degree. But they consider it vile, or scoff people with the detriment of the vulgarity.
What i'm saying is its always reductionist. A templar necessarily has to be equated with a man wiping shit all over his body as his prostitute shat on him. It can't be anything in between, it has to be reduced, NEVER emancipated.
its JUST sex its JUST shit its JUST psychotic, its JUST paranoid.
So in the Schopenhauerian reality its like NO i did n't have normal all sexual emancipation its mine mine mine so you can't have it you can't have it either. The world is MY imagination and i feel very EMBOLDENED considering you are living a free ride and get more opportunities out of life.
As far as shit is concerned its usually the modern highly hygenic dogma, the little pot, which accidentally has to show the plumbing, if its decorated or made into a box or a vase people actually frown, then they double down and go WHUT? you have a tube in it. It needs to be SHOWN??
THis and their constitution, philosophy, and the way they look these toilets, is merely ABBERENT??
In every way the fact Duchamp used a rather modern urinal implied much. If he put the Marie Antoinette toilet on its side he would have indicated a whole other thing.
In any case where Spinoza said that if a rock would think, it would consider gravity his will, if a rock could think, it would also consider itself pretty valuable being stacked in a temple, if not for BUT gravity be its will, but WE WILL decide for the stone. Apparently as Kant proved, some people always decide somehow.
One should n't have yourself shelved as a "weirdo" as much either.
What do they have left?
We are artists we built the classical worlds?
And what do they have left??
They constantly say owh you want to be a baroque artist where arts was respected?
Well that COULD be so in which case my or our existence is still very melancholic
but probably we are just fighting all these people who want to shelve everything away because they can't think for themselves or have no real "time" for themselves and have to weed out like "classical" ideas.
If we who listen and sense to listen we need not consider what we sense of others to be subjective, it does not not have to hit as we learn to position ourselves and learn further degrees of our position. Likewise if we state something it should not necessarily be the most detrimental or superficial.


II MAIN IDEALS, LEARN TO SEE A BIGGER CONSPIRACY THEN THE REDICULOUS ONES.

Is the depletion of fish, the irradication of forests, the extinction of bee's and the internet today as a like and like a shared item, All subjectified commentaries and self indulgence two sides of the same coin? This goes deeper into the teaching of Immanuel Kant, the forming of the a-sensory subject, in fact he was an autist himself drawing the world into his own religion, from the all general awe of God to the specific subjectified subject. If we all said what was to us aesthetic, with fury, then we would still be thinking, but all aesthetics being subjective is mainly what happened. Has he not created the situation where 85 percent of cows in Europe do no longer leave the stables? Because we do not find a sensory reality of meadows and cows to be in there very important. Now concidering all that, where do you place the limit to perception? Has it not been surpassed already? What to start producing meat out of petri dishes? What is the sensory reality of our life? No poets will ever dare write again? Suicides are already higher, they are probably the poets. The classical poets that is. Psychiatry is drugging the senses, as a means of subjectified analysis they say it is "restoring the balance in nerve threads." Are they not in fact "drugging the senses out of you to the standard of the autist who invented the subject "problem". Do you find it important to conspire for a new urbanism that can no longer condone the clean neighbourhoods where the chickens are stored somewhere at the other side of the world in large hangars in the dark, then scientists see that the chickens don't have feathers, engineering chickens without feathers?? To save on air conditioning? How shall you stop this and the philosophy and the irony that it involves and how can we save our senses, our sensory and artistic worth? How will you turn to a 19th century ethics and feeling of worth of nature that the romantic artists had again? How can you rephrain yourself from hesitation of saying something more serious, since it matters, under a debilitating commercial advertising propaganda system? Is not the final equation of the universe the destruction we see here in society? What more of a definitive theory can be found that what we by means of poetry describe about what we see? The forming of reason is indeed poetic, it is action and it conditions as projects. Is a definitive positivist answer to the ways of the universe, not then only before hand subjective to the responsability we have, to intervene in the disaster of society? And everything else for a mathematics an illusion deemed somewhere outside that perception? Mathematics is clearly an Allegory much as God, no Genius who invented todays discourse ever should have said it was more then that. And observe its origin and all the quotes more carefully, that was all that was said, apart from Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein, and some others who formed a thread against Holderlin, William Blake and Sade and Nietzsche. But the avant gardists of the early Twentieth century, inspired mainly by Sade and Nietzsche besides that, their humour has also developed for the worst of the balance, it has created a disdained humour that renders the revolution they themselves started against the middle class relative. Propose a theory where there is no solipsism as today, but a reality starting from the front of your eye balls, and ending at the wall behind which you can not see, or the horizon perhaps. Or societies decay. What is before the wall behind which is the object, and what is before your eyes in which is the subject, the subject and the object DO NOT EXIST, and that is subjectivity reversed into perception. It is time you should understand that and wake from your sleep that was induced 200 years ago. Time for a perceptability, and what will you find, you are locked up among this modern cages system with a screen and a highway to a supermarket, welcome, i been living in this cage for 20 years, being aware of the entire philosophical system that renders everyone useless to react to it, people who are conditioned by Immanuel Kant through years of influence he had, if you would see the thread you would grow a serious venom opposed to this complacency. Its not easy. Abandone all modern subjectivity, drugging the senses, minimalist architecture, Fake bank notes, of who'm are hardly artisan classical, and ergonomy in bank providing lack of artisan quality in any goods. These goods industrial and poor quality not even being an issue when you want luxury?? Owh get me twenty sinks and I consider myself a rich person?? Meanwhile bank tellers and train stations are dissapearing, owh ergonomics, use a machine. Fashion is a religion, they used to all be into wealth of artisan art you know. To educate them to do otherwise is reasonably corrupt and unsatisfying to anyone and everyone. Urban architecture making luxury cages without there being organic artisan reality. Would this call possibly work everyone out of their backside??? Can it find its leaders and prophets to rekindle its ability to create? Can it recite all these wise that spoke of the death of the imagination and the sickness of having lost our language of form and elegance? Our language to play...! To make merely arts for profit or fame? What about dialects, philosophy, esthetics?! Nothing of that can be treu as its only just fame. Which also draws now not to the pejorative of fame, though poets used to talk about immortality and glory rather, but also through the mere quality and futile of fame in a democracy, and the lack, yes, in advance unreciprocated notion of avant garde, provocation, cult, substance, something which the surrealists still managed to resist, has some little outlayers, but other then that no one has time for to wait for, as there is really no time. I can't single handedly replace all modern garbage with artisan works? And even if i did everyone would still have their religion and understand nothing. They would say hahhh where is my cage and my coka cola and my pizza?! A society of certain grace once and now see this strain of cars coiling ever more inwards, slower, stagnation, the end...Everyone thinks this society is definitive, they can not see how the evolution of cars and skyscrapers rose, swollen, grew, expanded, bulged outwards. Not to a cosmic collaps, but in a traffic jam, or a lack of oil having them all rendered useless anyway, but do you work towards that future?? Do you make other plans but extend highways? No. Your politicians are amorph elements of an evolution of providing the masses. They speak of percentages of sales percentages of labour while they refuse to come up with two words to lead you out of this mess you are in. Why is n't any advert to suffice yourself more, why is n't any advert for leasure and cars and food illegal yet?! Churchill cried out and yelled at every factory for you to work harder. Here what do they do? Tell you to consume and make more consumer goods?! The subject problem created ever more relative people and offered them nothing but to go around in circles, consuming ever faster, buy a "new" toothpaste, run after a new mobile phone design, here is a new "sugar drink" and Marx is still actual you think?! And eventually the circle looped. Is it not treu the illusion of our equations finally come from Immanuel Kant then? As the structuralists said, our thread of thought is in the structure, Kant, Schelling, Einstein, just as freud came from Arthur Schopenhauer and Schopenhauer came from Kant, do you not feel we are living in an illusion? An ILL lusion yes. look at all the skyscrapers? Do they not represent the a-object, or the platonic idea even so. The subjectified void? Does the economy not, through Hegel, suffice the abstract needs, without leaders or imagination? Imagination grown entertainment? More subjectification! The depletion of content out of images creates yet another illusion of freedom through debilitating irony on commercial billboards and random entertainment where the profound allegory calling for beauty, principles, honour and passion is disturbed by a dull malign spirit to pascify, images spewed out rather then orderly arranged according to Ideals, and what of the propaganda then? THAT is not propaganda? There is some notion of this now, but there is no theory to support it, here is the theory, easily you can produce all the psychology of the main influences on society, the Hegel Psychology as the Nazi psychology, which was a hysterical reaction towards the fact that society would become unmanagable, that it would derail since every subject would walk a different direction. To state that that indeed has happened and change is impossible now is probably not an easy sounding notion for this great "democratic" sensitivity of this world today. How will it ever solve reality to have billions of commercial billboards on earth for everyone to consume their way out of this misery? Communism; suffice the proletariat and the dialectic process of thesis antithesis to synthesis will end. That is the prime goal of civilisation. This also has been creeping into society today, communism is somehow part of kapitalism, in the monotomy of car designs, the unity pulp of entertainment and products, the supression of ideas and avant garde in the media, and black metal as a militant movement oonly individualized, society is a combination of all past and surpassed ideas of the past 200 years under the triumphator kapitalism, and having stolen an irony of the avant garde. It uses the irony with which they wanted to liberate society to stifle beauty and the very venom of rebellion. Which without this argument of avant garde irony, you would be far more serious and you were far more conservative in acting before they came along. For too long modernists neglected the brilliance of the romantic era, it is THE era to wake us from our present sleep, THE era where we have started to sleep, where this liberty started to make all powerless subjects, incapable to dictate treu beauty! The sensory books of the symbolists, the overidealization of the senses, the sacredness of the senses and the trials for new rituals for art. The awe for nature, religion of nature and allegory, we need to evaluate once more these, organize them in the light they need. The "One can roam the stars and distant heavens and never aqcuire more, therefore there is a poetic genius" of WIlliam Blake... "The seek refuge into art" Then surely this goes for all and should not be a hobby to all while their regular work is in the petri dish hamburger factory. And now society is destined to die, by its own hands or by the hands of the idealists, how sad... All this was a Utopia once, and a Utopia will be formed again, if one says this world will destroy itself any solution is deemed an Utopia and it is an entirely related to the subjectivity, it is the very core of this problem of argumentation, and modernism has many problems of argumentation, "everything is about money" well, learn an art nouveau ideal or a romantic ideal in stead of THAT for an ideal. Nobody believes in money other then it be a religion and that nihilism is as a matter of fact, strengthening the religion... If there is NO utopia, you can organize your household as a Utopia, and indeed, thats all that within the scope of subjectivism should be stated. Subjectivism therefore IS a utopia, the utopia to insulate against the world in your ideal kitchen, ready to grow and sustain in peace, and breed, and then consumed entirely too much land for all those kitchens. Go organize your household; Well why would n't that incorporate more then just my own garden and kitchen my household? Modernists will have nothing left but their big souvenirs, we should make souvenirs of dead castles rather, as a curse to modern man. We should have a petition for his Neuschwanstein and Taj Mahal and Paris Eiffel tower to be demolished, how it is keen on its trivialized icons, and inconsiderate of every nuanciation of it. The subject can only understand the trivialized icons,... The details, the richess, the luxury of the era is neglected. Rise, mock the collapsed powers and seaze beauty again. The money is false, it features old buildings who are not built by this economic system, and it features a skyscraper that is meant to be invisable, it does not even exist, the artists corrupted the arts and destroyed it, there is no art in this world, if all the classical arts were destroyed what would you have left? Kitsh and Concept, nothing real. If you do what you do now the earth will die, you have to do something else. And the first thing you need to do, is get yourself a proper ideal with some determination in stead of all this hollow phrases of hope and change, hollow phrases of aliens, racism, gay rights and what more. You need to develop your language, you need to incorporate the senses to deter from the large economic structure. THIS is the machine to do it then, no more excuses!
Because you react, out of a subjecttheory, out of a joke you can find amusing or an inconvenience that bothers you, you should react from now on in a structural view, that everything you do relates to the state of the world as it is today. And that state is diar, desperate, and you are having a party on top of ruin.
And you say, collectively, some six billion or so voices are saying "I can't help it, its not my responsability" this is -in a democratic system- a very despaired and disfunctional thought?? Again, as we said before, the random masses concoct yet another verse "Yes but if everyone makes a small contribution." Not at all realizing the whole plot they are fulfilling with their "small contributions" and indeed that "cleaning their room" or "tidying their front lawn" all needs to pollute the earth all over again.
DO NOT, subjectify yourself further along with everyone else, analyse everything as a culture and find the principled engagement, join us and develop the ideas with the artists.
And say only now then. ALL?!... IS MY OWN AND ONLY RESPONSABILITY, it works BETTER that way!! ALL is my responsability. NOT i can't do anything about the greater whole i will do something small to sustain myself and my own sanctity, IN THIS WHOLE GRAVEYARD OF IDEALS?! We have NOTHING of a worth in 6 billion people who are saying i can't do anything, or i do a SMALL thing, and the few on top screwing everyone over with an item more to promise, a new ideal each day spouts out of the advertisement, for which then others are practically kept in enslavement.

V HENCE OUR IDEALS PRIMORDIAL
I'm not here to cure humans misery upon eachother or everyone bullying eachother, if it was within my power i would stop bullying and do it for an extra treat of dictatorial justice yes, but so far the ONLY concern i can see and the ONLY concern i am responsable for and which responsability demands me to be occupied in only that and to have no other quarrels with anyone else since you all get nowhere with it just as you are, is an AESTHETIC revolt, that revolt is very sure, it is in the Muse uprising song, it is everywhere, you just hesitated to formulate the solutions, it is the duty to preach this ideal, and so that all grand crimes of mankind towards beauty end. THose crimes are not necessary, they are not profitable, they are not befit not on a Mars-Moon-Earth Economy they are not befit of a universal economy they can not fit anywhere because you would end evolution if you carried on your crimes against beauty. Some of these very simple interventions partain trash, rubbish, souvenirs, tourism, sports, station buildings, roofs, bus stands, even door bells and all more enhanced such trash, trash does n't exist in nature, it should n't exist in an artisan reality. We can have an industrialized high technological reality with massive aesthetic neoclassic and art nouveau composures among which a new Capital for every major culture; Europe a few, US, Canada, etc. Arabia, Africa. And for a new march towards new cities and new employment, but for most problems we have now the main quality of them it is truly, that your democratic leaders refuse to lead you, because they would n't know how to do that. You have to realize one thing, banks are there to invest, because there is no leader, the core of a society is its architecture, in which you live and in which perception lives and in which life organizes itself, and its going WITHOUT leadership, WITHOUT theory, on an automatic pilot. It absorbs all the garbage because there is no beliefs. Romantics and symbolists they were eras where artists tried to develop beliefs for themselves, unfortunatly they have failed to find believes for masses. We have to redo them all, IN REVERSE. AGAIN. And if you looze your profits, we will create a bank to just deposit numbers on your bank account for more mansions owh my really you were the most amusing, the rich and their modern art and their modern investments. Wauw, i'm very impressed, suppose We were a Michaelangelo? And a Da Vinci? What do you think we would find so wild and rich about all those aqcuisitions? Thousands of years old beauty now rot and worn out, that you could never build today because it would just shine off it, and millions of minimal carton board fast pasted up decors. Now finally you let the real architects march in and have the earth and every building fitted and finished to a magnificent standard, we do apreciate you took so much energy and wasted so much concrete and chopped up the marble meanwhile for your futile sinks. I get your sense of humour. Once again, the sooner you understand all that, the better it is for yourself, artists will gladly die in this misery, in fact every word we write and not get aired worldwide has just few more commit suicide and spit in your face doing it. You don't have to listen to this, We are not here for your popular game, your entertainment game, your political game, or your quizz show, we are from way back. And you can leave us and this site alone if you will but blabber at a level that is opened as soon as i put on the internet regular or the tv or come outside, you already have a reality, you already have a television and quizz, don't make this into a mess in its turn. WE WILL POLICE YOU HERE, AND WE WILL SEE TO EVOLVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING HERE PUBLIC, YOUR VOTES YOUR BABBLE, EVERYTHING, NOW YOU CAN EITHER ACCEPT THERE IS ONE SITE INDEED INTERNATIONAL AND URGENT AND POLITICAL, OR GO CRAWL INTO THE CAVITY OF YOUR POLITICAL EMBARASSEMENT WHERE YOU FOUND YOURSELF BEFORE YOU READ THIS; Go... Away.


THE FIRST SACRED PAGAN ACTS AND THE SUPRA-ARTISAN SOCIETY
The three sacred pagan projects I the Anduin alliance (Anduinallians) to cross a highway with aproximatly five noble horses, ten maidens with art nouveau garments, two viking ladies with shields, three black metal soldiers and seven artists dressed in gothic attire to claim the right for if this is society of rubbish the poets have the right to cross highways. If trucks can block highways with notion of further luxury we artists and classics have been completely violated in our rights into your new religion!!
The three sacred pagan projects II the Bralda Him alliance (Bralda-HimAllians) To attack with some ten people some cars in antwerp, a small street amount in Total as a minimum amount but who knows how far we get. As a manifest that one city is claimed for the artists over all the rubbish and stupidity and nothing shall be done to hold the splendour of the crafts for ONE city on a world of crap back from this ONE city to happen!
The three sacred pagan projects III The Teviot Alliance (Teviotallians) To build one or more false commercial billboards and set them on fire. Later dressing them up with romantic paintings, to object to the worlds hysterical commercial irony and present the simplicity of a world with all etherical beauty without the constant stress and heathen immorality of consumption in a Total decay world.
These are three, perhaps or not the first acts, but there are thousands of those acts, they will be, without you will be able to do anything about it.
It will grow
It will be a supra artisan society that lives according to a few simple rules for beauty and nature.
They are worth more then your society, and your society, as a sake of evolution itself, will never be tolerated not near, not under, certainly not above these people and these initiatives, a new way of revolt, and much more serious then all underground bloated screams of war like indeed the teenagers that they are, youth is beautiful, but we have been put on a leash, and we are all too much cowards for war and we are incapable to war with axes most likely, or we would have done it a long time ago.
Maybe when the battle plan is clear and urgent to the ones who need to know about it. Then maybe you cut some peoples brains open, but then actually, it will no longer be necessary, because the artists will have united and rose to "fame" to reorganize society already.
So, it is indeed quite desperate to laugh at the romantic, the moving, the endearing, so as to choke our last bits of humanity into a grave and then, eat the Petri dish hamburger, drive to the supermarket on a highway, buy a toxic gleu composite closet and throw it away the next few months, only for our last remaining pleasure the supermarket redeem us once more. We can no longer laugh, not even cynical decadents, as most artists became after the French revolution. They, most, abandoned society, and see where society is now. We are compelled not to laugh anymore because it is... Terribly romantic, a species, so desolate, so remote from a peaceful meadow, having locked its cows in the stables, as 85 percent of some EUropean ancient medieval composure of land does no longer wish to see its cows on the meadows. We further industrialize, conceptualize, make our indifference known to the Hesiodian farmers. We can easily see what is the cause of this drama, virtually every philosophy since Immanuel Kant, the perception was no longer key, we became our own universe, and did not look out, everything was irony from then on, sweet ideals were irony from then on, aesthetics became bittered, aesthetics became dark, misanthropic, rancour...Then here we offer ideals everyone can understand, we state them, the problems and the answers, and of a hope to come from the depth, from winter, straight into spring, no fall or any somber reality is bound after spring. It is pure life, colors, blossoms, bright light returning, grass growing fresh again, that you can understand, this nihilism of entertainment without purpose, this computer game without it adhere or has to measure to the principle of not wasting ones time, soon we will all be drawing numbers at psychiatry, then we take some medication, in stead of some illuminated psychiatry, leading the cows in the stables to the meadows, i'm ready to volunteer to do this one time, and releave the farmer from his choirs. I am a sculptor after all, a classical sculptor, if he can no longer get cows to the meadows i can no longer sculpt classical angels, the whole system collapses if there is no aesthetics at the source. This society its construction, has been deleted and fragmented, now we will need to defragment it again, to create the beauty which is interlocked with ecology. We state the problems, traffic, localized culture, boredome, classical architecture and art, with skills and the pleasure of the language of form. The chickens in hangars, develop neighbourhoods with chicken runs, and highrise baroque palaces for all citizens, and meadows nearby, productive and used meadows, we need to establish the sound of the heathen ideas, and solve the problems of the modern outcome of industrialized society. We can no longer have an entire pagan underground producing "just about music music" which would be entertainment, when the whole world is decaying as a cause of neglect of pagan principles. Let those who can weep for beauty decayed join us, and people role playing before coming to actual manners and principles of some aristocracy, let them join us. Let those who can still be moved for what the theory of subjectivity did to mankind join us, read Holderlin, William Blake, and those who walked another path then modernism. Still believed in imagination over ergonomics, if at all we are talking of ergonomics, speaking only of percentages of economy, for the financial market to grow out of numbers numbers, and no one to lead, no one to see where the forests must grow again, no one to see where the orchards and the winter gardens must be, now they are all only one orchard somewhere, one laboratory growing chicken meats and beef by the time you read this, and all more trucks, perhaps on solar energy, driving on a giant ashpalt plain, to bring us this beef and chicken, and we drive to the supermarket to pick it up. bee's are extinct, flowers are dead, fish will be extinct, i mean those three, everything, the foundation of beauty is about to collapse, and it is not on any commercial billboard, so let us now abandone commerce and hijack the billboards for the actual important ideas to reclaim the earth. no romantic could have dreamed in his misanthropic megalomania to write the entire extinction of everything that grows beauty, but we almost wrote it. SO abandone society. THIS is society, state each of your farms, initiatives, projects, design your theatres, movie theatres, and post them here, create a world on top of this dying world, it is an advantage that it is dying, our lunacy to claim authority will not be so vain. It is not a crime to have leasure in despair, it IS dumb to denounce the Euphorea of a grand cause, medieval principles and artisan novelty, and pagan glory, in a time of absolute decay!!

A king is the ultimate democratic principle, he can be any character of the species, its not the ancestry its the individual, even if in the future a queen is more aesthetic, a young queen, full of desire for beauty, shiny, happy, not a bittered and hysterical aunt, and advised by artists. In the romantic era most princesses started at fifteen, their own world at least looked the least bit more splendourous. A single person to enact the policies is, modernism has proved it, the only way a society can have leadership. Capitalism does n't work for workers, the innovative mind, the true individual is few, and is hampered by the weight of the needs in society, besides no easy innovation is left to improve the world, except for restoring it. The worker needs work, here the right wing considers every person should just work his way up the ladder of success and if you are not, it is your own fault, due entirely to the theory of "evolution" which makes no sense. How does the cone shaped egg of birds who live besides cliffs become cone shaped, not because all the oval eggs fell off the cliff, and only the cone shapes stayed in the nests. Not all deer are killed by lions because they are weaker, its absurd to think there is a balance between a human and a mosquito to be sucking up the blood of humans or the humans to kill all the mosquito's. Its perverted and sick and leads to the society of the most frustrated and the most vile. If anything christianity was more treu, how could the weak frailest deer not be infinatly more beautiful then a fleeing pack of deer or even then the lion. Beauty itself relief on frailty. Metaphysics as stated was the highest, the frailest opposed to the gratuit shit, much like it was bound to have a finest taste or the most beautiful colors needed to be infinatly delicate, rare, and timid. There is as much balance and symbiosis in nature as there is stronger, there is the aid and the notion of reason in mankind, and there is such a reason in nature. If not all deer are killed by the lions, if that is a false equivalency? What on earth is you saying that if you are an artist, melancholic, or simply, blind, or incapable to hold a job, or insane, or unable to take care of yourself? What on earth has that to do with the survival of the fittest you see in nature? I see a lot of self absorbed arrogant successfull people, who have no merit in anything whatsoever. How are they lions? They don't have manes, they are bald ugly cats or likely dogs, deformed, they are monsters!!
Most rich who say others should be just as much capitalists and succeed thrive on the innovation of ancestors, their education has seen themselves more capability to understand and handle luxury, however EVERY person should have such an education and understanding, as the common offspring of innovators proves exactly that. Vulgarity is not hereditary, it is related to education, when the vulgar are educated to be aristocrats they are at least vulgar aristocrats, which in any case is preferably over vulgar plebeians. An aristocrat knows of his worth through something called the life of the mind, the spirit, the french "Esprit". today we are degenerated into the humour(less) lack of worth of all irony, merely to have to phrase the opposite and get the upper hand, concepualism, merely to state the pharce is art and it becomes art.
Therefore every person must have the education of art history and evolution of modern subjectivity and parrallel industrialization
Therefor the un-reason, the fuck off, the i am what i want, the individualism, the subjectivity, as if it needs no education nor reason is a false idea.
Everyone must learn the society structure and power structure since 1800, since the authority of kings was doubted the right wing supported the reestablishing of the king under opressive conciderations since, the classicists neoclassicists and later the nazi's somehow acknowledged the hereditary right of kings to be treu, a new idea evolved and more hysteria came about deu to the problems of leadership and the lack of alternatives, this saw the evolution of the neoclassic artists into the national socialist movement and so on, concidering popular culture or expression, non academic art "entartet" degenerated. To a certain extent, that is treu, the educational value of classic allegories on beauty and the allegoric notion of guardians of sea, forest and nature, the lack of serenity and proud in that, has ultimatly led to the destruction of our respect for nature. This can not as much be denied. The modern irony as a reaction to Hitler is a sheer debilitation into ecologic and cultural catastrophy. Which does n't mean i'm a fascist, i'm simply saying Hitler and modernism are verifiably more of the same. I am myself a pluralist in behavior and mythological and spiritual convictions, but I am clearly seeing something else entirely dominates modern society?! THIS IS NOT BUT AS APART OF ESTHETICS THE TOPIC OF THIS MANIFEST.
This evolution then of having no respect or being preoccupied with other interests then nature and artisan reality has developed by a number of coincidences and developments such as the absurd notion that an allegory needs to be treu or untreu, this caused by the notion of subjectivity by Immanuel Kant, in fact reality as art is within our perception so it is by definition treu, the allegorics of that view itself is hampered and can only be excused and defended concidering trivial or irrational arguments such as well, he is blind, thus to him colors and vision do not exist, hence colors and vision do not exist by definition, thus we concider, they don't exist, everything is subjective which means they don't exist. Its not so much that this is an argumentation, what i'm arguing that it creates matter in its own right. It created A LOT of it, it created a lot of side tracking formulas. Of which Wittgenstein and the theory of relativity are only a few, their moral highground is certainly the same, their considerations need to be revised simply.
This grew into the creation of the sect of modernists, who violantly oppose anything an artist or an educated artisan awareness would naturally apreciate, it makes him have no respect for himself, eat hamburgers, buy crap, etc
The modernist sect then for what the power structure is concerned will opress or grow enterprises more anonymous in the venture for more compiled cash, this is not wrong, in the light of the present ideology it is the ONLY thing people believe, because indeed you will hear everywhere, "they only believe in money', but in the past so many other things were believed, and actually created, existed, in behavior, in appreciation of beauty, hence the idea to say "they" only believe in money, it is not innocent, it is to conspire, it conciders that the subjectivity does not make a difference, hence nobody makes a difference, hence, nothing, indeed, happens... What a surprise with that attitude. With the subject the nuance was discarded and the mere idea of a thing remained. "Everyone believes in Christianity" What on earth does that imply or change matters? These people are effectively mute?!
The education of the values of aesthetics hence sensory bound life is self evident and is currently neglected, that is not a subjective opinion, that needs to be on the commercial billboards in fact, and does not need to compete with every day trivliaties, it is not a standard i came up with, it is a standard related to the structural limits of reality, our current reality is not modern except for being out of sensory bound, the notion that 85 percent of cows don't go the meadows is but one example of that, the chickens in hangars, in a very practical way, the notion that we watch tv and don't go to a theater no more to watch a tragedy, is equally a sensory bound problem. The pulpification then of the allegories comes with the neglect of, both the artisan sacredness of a bleu sky and pure water in rivers, as it is a cause of it, all factors subjectivity, a sensory bound inventions and mechanisation complemented eachother to construct a world that is so alien the ecology can not cope with it anymore, nor can the human mind, noting the depression, it would be most usefull to abolish all international industry and have people in every neighbourhood a cow to craft shoes out of and eat meat, to be conciderate of the shoes they have, the entire balance of earth and the overtransport of todays world, it would all be solved. This notion of subject has rendered someone doing a laundry in a washing machine is "wealthy" and the source or waterfall somewhere remote this person is "poor" So we can only presume that the notion of wealth changed from the gravitation of functionality and that that is all an a-sensory notion. At least to great extent this may be argued. To a gravity of 60 percent of society at least. The only thing that would crash is the present kitsh Las Vegas treadmill. Artificiality and pulpified pyramids carton board, THAT would all crash, and because of the depletion of resources, it WILL crash. Maybe you can crash in elegance before the world is dead. Before we have depleted all resources on earth driving in circles for throw away closets in stead of using some energy to venture to Mars and Moon to expand.
The common man, to aquire wealth, getting desperate in wealth, and aquire crap and become arrogant in aquiring crap, or the common man, clinging to his fortune, aqcuiring more money, without helping, without aiding to the romantic, to beauty, romantic being to see cows in the meadows, to see people have a job, working for bread and an occasional beer, is basically the same common man, there is no need to envy the rich as it is more educational to be poor, with being rich come upportunities who deem it for him to be just as responsable as there are the responsabilities for the working class, but we all needed to kick violantly about us. "There was no future." In effect its been said "The Wasteland" It was the only pluralist thing to say. Now find out if you want to realize that. In "we are going to kick as you are "just" the same as us" This is no philosophy worthy of leaders or worthy of philosophy? Its simply unsustainable as it would mean anyone needs to have as much STUFF as the next person. Why did n't you demand some aristocratic wealth? Of which you already have more ergonomic wealth then any passed king? You have bigger banquets now? But you need to keep kicking. And me as an avant gardist has to say what now? Well indeed the most pluralist book to write now is "Its over" or something like that.
In any case some areas are treasures as being tennated by some specific zoo creature perhaps. Which is the monkey the working class or the aristocrat is not always clear. But we'd likely be very snobbish to the working class if objecting to those meadows and prime esthetic landscapes be cut up for more suburbs and sports stadiums, football fields, conceptual arts, hotels, hysteria, squeeling and kicking citizens.
But in essence, a society is to accomplish shit. You pay in to build a school. If you have a house you contribute to build a house. There is nothing wrong with taxes, besides money is just printed for the love of God don't snibble all your dislike of your entire life in a factory and poor wages on the fact you pay taxes, taxes are for the expenditures of communical projects. It keeps money stacked for a purpose other then your own leasure, your own composure, its someone else of the communal project to decide what is the composure. You can NOT complain you pay taxes, if you play the lottery, massive bonus expected, lets invest, no investment in anything but myself? You can TELL the politicians to do something proper with them. Which would be to have an ecological state, an ESTHETIC state, but to complain you have to pay taxes while you are in essence richer then Louis Quatorze, have to practice nothing but indulgance, with all your OWN tastes in souvenirs and plastic crap, for which can be the only industrial sustenance as a theorem of society, is LUDICROUS? Money needs to circulate back to the large projects, the large projects demand then.
ECOLOGICAL BALANCE which does n't mean create industrial scale projects, there are plenty innovative ideas ready to be implemented in skyscrapers and residential areas. USE THEM.
ESTHETIC PROWESS Which does n't mean minimalism, There are plenty of artists unemployed to decorate shit. USE THEM.
CULTURAL RELEVANCE again which does n't mean minimalism or industrial only ergonomic architecture. there are plenty of artisan craftsman. Just wasting time pushing buttons in all your office buildings and factories. USE THEM.
The poor in essence have no responsabilities, if you provide then they have a responsability, if you live off the supermarket, which most today do, then you DO have a responsability, any other notion is hypocrisy. You do not suck dry the entire earth saying people are shit without deserving an execution rather then an income, even if you have a job, which sadly today catalogues a lot of people, sobbing about everything, having a job, going to a supermarket, and concider, equally so trough having been given no education and living in the modern subjectivity sect, that that is all they need to care for. You are provided for, therefore you are an idealist, idealism is in the practicality of living. Hitler at least died with his realm, the masses can be known to squeel and cry at the gallow right now. "If we would take from them their aqcuired values and tastes." Which practical reality will take from you anyway, for a worthless dump of a society. Sooner rather then later. The rappers in the Ghetto contest of these things too I imagine.
What we are saying is considering humans are "just shit" is equally an ideal. Not because it would n't be treu, simply because we analyze, no one would have come up with it before Kant. That there are so many of them. Is simply because they were educated in the wrong way. Myself frankly I am sick of it, I am trying to compose a new idea and notion of culture, the ones who got stuck in a derogatory nihilism out of monty Python and take it in their own intolerable nature and are tremendously frustrated can take it somewhere else. If they are on this site they will behave or stay on other social platforms. An entirely different notion then considering skin color important. Skin color is actually part of perception, much like an artwork, duhh. -Its not because someone develop the notion of a subject now that skin color should n't exist, that means i'm also doing away with any notion of either white supremacy or for that matter black trauma, which is the other part of the scale i imagine. I too have been traumatized, kicked and surpressed, hell the whole underground of more intelligent and artistic people is playing BLEUS, saying in songs we have to exist for the zombies, while the top is playing RAP, saying they thrive digging gold for theit ghetto kingdom?! I do not consider myself sheer rights based on any wrong doing, but the notion that you have to fight over the notion that you deserved anything at all? But i don't concider a simple gimmick of my vanity for dialogue is enough to win, we keep fighting with more esteem and vigour simply. If a black man marries a blonde, i don't consider that in any way corrupt, i don't consider them as a subject marrying a subject, and i certainly don't think all blondes should marry black men. Nor vice versa as probably is not considered much, as most blonde woman have the subject notion for them as a philosophy considering themselves subjects or even mere objects, and as exotic natures don't have the western subjectivity as a core to their ideals. it is parrallel to an artistic notion that you don't want to irradicate something that is unique. Something the West is doing to itself now, and of which influence is certainly building the ghetto's of Mies Van Rohe the world over. We don't consider race to be some kind of scientificly established notion, we deem it more of a poetic and artistic notion. Of which needs not necessarily be made an exact science, or a dogma, but handled with an amount of aristocratic prowess, generosity to avail arrogance and abberent supression, as much as that goes for virginity. A young girl is not a subject. A young boy is entirely frail as well sometimes considering my own experience. Its not ALWAYS about fucking, which could contest for many a platonic relation or platonic love I indeed had, rare, but not just "subjective" it is in effect and was always of a more religious experience, we do not consider a marriage can not in itself be a religious experience nor consider marriage should be abolished entirely. But some woman surely get very souer after having had some lovers, just as a measure of warning you. Their sense of having on and only is not disproprortionate to males, as in males it would be estimated the decadence of it all has attractions. If you do happen to meet a virgin by that, i have met a LOT who are quite generous and frail and have a very different kind of vanity then woman who had lovers. That counts as much for a general notion as the fact woman are naturally frail. The idea that we have some aqcuisition as a subject now and the classic parthenon notion of virginity should not be consired in general society, or be considered as a concept UNDER the general conceptualization as humans as subjects, down the garbage can with that. Frailty is simply as a infinatly subtle notion, of which can exist in society, and is usually corrupted in society, this means not that we should stop deifying it or hold that notion to more esteem then sheer pornography?! We do not consider opting for this philosophy over another, or identifying and developing personality as bullying, but the general theory is seriously faulty. Develop theories into ideals. Don't dillute more of the same notions, There is not even a way out without this manifest?! What where you going to do without getting out of the subject trap? Tell me? Its part of natural law to recall it.
The rich accumulate more and more wealth, and are protected by law, untill the accumulation, by cause of the protection by law, stirs a natural revolt, this revolt is deu, after which all the rich will be seazed their property. Or as can be predicted, their wealth simply evaporates. As the arts change course. Both the antique can be considered ruins and the modern considered depletion, self irradication. At some point the values get lost.
It is completely natural.
We could simply stop to consume, make our own products again, and pay the false money right back to the rich, pay it as taxes, nothing will change, well a lot will change, less crap and more artisan jobs???
And it is beneficial for the irradication of the modern sect and its ideology.
The same reason is that politicians are the best means to bring about a new revolt and a new beginning for beauty, because they have finally wrecked the place, it is because it is wrecked, we can start over, if there was all beauty today. We would n't have OPPORTUNITY.
A structure like this, can’t survive on Mars and MOon and can not develop all over the Universe, only a technology with within, artisan beauty can develop, or a technology to display the ideals and concept of the artisan world, which includes the female body. Naturally.
The male body is rediculous. Lesbians are naturally and in general more attractive to anyone. Most woman are experimenting in bisexuality anyway.
All things that are redundant, a surplus, must be made with care, that on contrary of overredundance, the importance is once again embedded by means of an artisan craft, the expression and care. This is why people need to learn about products and the elementary principle of products, if people buy everywhere all this crap and get it scrapped again they just NEED TO WORK A LOT MORE?! also this reason is why a personal income needs to be guaranteed, no work needs to be done if it is not necessary, stupid souvenirs are not necessary, how much percent of the world is made out of crap? and we all HAVE to work for keeping that world "in balance?" Again, meanwhile the artists need to get a job?! Then they go "in the nineteenth century to hold slaves were legal, or to be working class was to live in deplorable situations and live on a slice of bread. Right. So ethics is conflated with Esthetics, the ritual of life is conflated with the nature of its political system and its atrocities? There were people entirely against the notion of slavery in the nineteenth century, and i don't understand what exactly a repetition of Baroque, renaissence, Romantic, Art Deco Arts has to do with slavery or atrocities, or scarcities of food, or the lack of someone to throw an apple out on the street and have it for himself. Right I have to live modernisms esthetics and morals and "values" whatever they may be considered as clearly they are apparent, because some people in the past were "selfish" and had this audacity to comply to a consensus to have slaves? So now i must comply to the consensus that there is a lot of garbage? What we can say to this society is then simply that "everyone believes in money" and that "all is done for cheap thats just normal" should i make art of that? Should i engrave you money with that on there??? These atrocities are not mentioned herein but i'm sure you can come up with a war between Mars and Earth some time. I'm sure. I'm going to provide you with fire spewing axes and swords for weapons and electronbubble shields, not many people would be killed, i have not in the slighest interests in people being killed or surpressed in any way. i have merely the responsability to explain, that atheism as a standard, which is merely parasitical, and the western subjectvity, is hysterical, and in its moral highground becomes parasitical and entirely despaired. That nothing of the classics is disproven, nor of religion, and that releaves even a lot of the despair and hysteria of other cultures abberations in reaction to the West, as they don't want to be involved in a sort of total prostitution spree we are having, much less become this culture themselves or by that, also considering a serious revival of classical esthetic, and their own renaissence of discovery of pagan culture in the Grotto of modernism. As much as myself I had to learn from the Grotto of the internet, as my art teacher was hardly "objective" in his choices and lecture, well he found himself "objectivity" indeed, the presumptions of which are nowhere revealed but here and are entirely hidden in a code he does n't even understand himself?! That modernism as much as fascism is the philosophers fuckups is my responsability, I admit that. I fucked up. Now i mean to restore it.

Preliminary philosophy
We deduced from Schopenhauer that a refuge into art is desirable, as it is today also the only common ground we still have left. Art is not subjective, beauty comes in many forms and beauty is also a standard for ecology. Hence art, as a composition of beauty, or a moral facet of it, a thought pattern on beauty, is the means to restore the earth. BEAUTY is, still is, yes, the other kind of art some are already indignated or smirking that it could not possibly bind us is an old provocation that is now degraded into an analysis of a degenerate time (which you all agree on, concidering cars, streets, buildings, etc. not concidering our marvelous achievements like multiculturalism and gay rights. Even if they are just words and a lot of hypocrisy and vanity.) That the entire world is a provocation only counts for the ultimate avant gardists who are, indeed, glad that it ruined the earth, but WHEN does the ruin get boring and we start something else, at some point any avant gardist is tired of the current game.
We deduce from Sade that all crime and stupidity is allowed, extinction is also allowed, a mass frenzy, a Total massacre of crime, but counsciouss should be that crime, as the artist who writes it. one can sit out a refuge on a mountain, or even die on that mountain, having acquired peace, the deletion of the will to live, the deletion of moral value, they are both equal. If they can be reasoned, if you can gather a momentum on it of sprawling awareness. Usually not, the world is base, base crimes, trivial wars, if you had a castle as the Medici to defend, you might gain my sympathy, if you have a suburbian modernist villa to defend, you seriously have me doubt any intellect or possiblitiy you can even BE gratified or have eyes to comprehend gratification.
Hence we are sadists in what we want to acquire, we acquire it we presume, because we love life, and above all, we love the drama of life. The only success to saving the planet is not to concentrate on the morality, morality indeed is mankinds doom, it will always be there, we craft stories of it, we are artists, this is not the problem, beauty and ecology is. It will end crime and art and beauty and most life on earth will be eaten by you rodents before its finished off finally, and life on earth is majestic, art and beauty created by mankind is even more majestic, along with the drama of mankind if it is truly dramatic is majestic above animal cruelty among themselves. This is a fact, you do make a social struggles bubbles doubles spruttles it sprays like diarrhea all over this fucking planet of every drama, in such ways drama almost gets lost today. To greater calamity and ardency of the drama involved even. A cult of personality has been part of any awareness, even still most is corrupt and now there is the standards of family life. A consideration already defied by all the stances who actually created the age.
Again, the artists are called for,… again i state, they would be underneath, hiding, untill a worthy economy of thirty percent comes along again, an economy as the classic economy, filled with luxurious artisan goods, scarce and carefull products, scarce and carefull books. How can they be part of a world like this, or how should those books not run raging and raving like lunatics other then to be gently absorbed and sinking again in this culture, the storms of success above, tearing it down to where its topics are no longer concidered, and futile to gasp for air above… untill it is unmaintainable to last, that is why we would redraw no? Redraw but not retreat. The thirty percent is here, soon the people who just stair at things and paintings in museums and will always be stairing need to accept our lead. The ones the seventy percent and their quizz shows will never lead anything that is why there is only quizz shows and nothing actually leads anywhere. Part of the dumbfounded civil analysis. We don't need to belittle them much, but surely the despair of many is that nothing is found above or below as an alternative, yes the very notion of quizz shows creates the despair of the earth, there is always a hyerarchy, if you consider a soap series or a quizz show, its not going to amount to much credibility or consideration for esthetics at all, again, merely a product of subjectity.
The artists would have such influences, they draw back to earlier writing, as today we can see nothing but folklore figures left only capable to talk after the merry vices we need to respect today, as apart of this grand and omnipotent treasure we have aqcuired, if only for some more values and dogma, it would all come together and we could live in peace. Too much cynicism would not match the commercial break. Again, we need to have such abundance of cynicism, that the commercial break simply becomes so utterly and undeniably hypocritical to all. We need to be so honoust, that all the hysteria and treu venom of a lucidity to have simple short interuptions of people smiling so nauseating smiles becomes impossible. The classic writing is simply an education standard that was abandoned. Still they have nothing but shows to humiliate people, or to show them of their most humble and deeply familiar side. In the past all was written to distuingish one self, how can one distuingish oneself if one has all these people offered lottery tickets to trivial pleasures, or stacking dollars on little lids hoping some of them remain after so many sessions of vaults opening up, or perhaps on a Music channel people are still looking for coins at the bottom of a bowl of porridge. I don’t know if they still do that. The “consumer” is properly educated to be humble. Hopefully it will overcome all these lessons, and as i describe them we should describe more, we become counsciouss, and realize we have torn ourselves to drown deep underneath. We torn ourselves away from it all. Lets forget about all this in our deep sea. Sade also thought us, dispite the excrements, there is still possibility to myth and aristocratic style. So lets rebuild myth and aristocratic style, nothing has been lost today, so why is so much utterly lost today. Why is there no courage left? The old myths indeed never lost their brilliance, it is art that needs awarding, so we can use the name of the Gods as images of splendour, and if not, use their splendour for new images. Not to have broken them apart, “disbelieved them” whatever that may be, and therefore having given up the splendour. If anything the s of the GodS was discarded in religion. A thorough analysis why on earth one for the many was deemed necessary. The subject posits any God would and should do, any allegory could be aproached as art, and in art religious, not as dogma, freedom or religious feelings never needed to be a dogma for everyone else, but why the archeology of subjectity? Why the irony of entertainment to be truly free. Not to take anything seriously would then be the new dogma. Of which any to share a consensus other then irony must be totally repulsed and become fundamental, not because he is, but because the other side is also fundamental.
The Gods had a fury, a thundering fury, this also was given up, you need to relive and refind your fury, definatly.
Untill we find proper editors and a lot of the manifests below are cut short and selected what is usefull and rewritten what is poor. This will be all we have to shed some light on the background, that is so important, as, again, none we see or hear today is willing to tell us more about some background, some intellectuality, some allegory of their craft. It is all lost. It is the only era where war and fascism is concidered by aestheticians, and by any person of wisdom. Be it that if one was wise, fascism would be more gracefull and less hysterical, it would be a kingdom, or indeed, a Queendom, in light of leadership being now a responsability to aesthetics, a queendom would be preferable. Presiding over the streets, the organisation and dividing of the land, etc. Each individually, we left these kings behind us, well excuse me, but who cut up the land and built seven billion Berlin walls now in order to have earth unmaintainable, learn to distinct the modern troubles in light of the modern ideals. Don’t attribute the modern problems to newer problems you are as yet just imagining and spouting as more issues on the table for more evolution of decay, they are usually part of the ideals of this age, having cancelled out a few deciders and geniuses, their authority is not so important, we are all individuals now, we take to the heroism, scoff all the vile and putrid, all humanity needs to rever innocent heroes, and needs to be smeared in shit if he is n't one, and that is individualism, wauw.

"we can see if the morals vanished from the reasonable field of discourse, all that remains is ambitions and results, and more importantly, if those ambitions and those results are in any way pleasurable to us. All other debate or ownership dissapears, it would seem if we witness the streets today, the poor moral debate that is left, leaves us with little desirable, ambitious or luxurureous of results. Hence we must prepare for a revolution of the arts and the artisan life of pure beauty of each product, pure primitive beauty of a concept to develop something, not as a product, but as an art object. No longer will we produce as peasents, we will see peasents to become artists and produce at a metaphysical level, a leviating of consumption itself to a religious state. Where the ergonomic, the positivist feature of to consume, dwindles for a replacement of a world of carefull concideration and carefull taste. No longer do we shovel everything on a heap of consumption, we are mandatory to concider each of our tastes individually again, this does not need everyone to be educated, it just needs rich people look out for themselves, build themselves some wealth again, only few artists can do it, the proletariat are back relying on themselves. And again we can write a book of a greater length, our literature for some time was burdened by the aperceptual, the deletion of the prime objective of the classical sense, a sense of also having stench and chickens around as these manifests will prove. A world without it would leave but an industrial cleanliness and a drought of existence, and more cynical even, would leave in dark industrial hangars all the chickens as the artists as the sensitive soul, three of which all chickens artists and sensitive souls, are more or less akin.


1 We are Egypt
The world is not lost, history is not passed us, we are the Egyptian serene majesty, we are the greek purity and clean beauty, we are the Medieval craftsmanship and ourselves such craftsman, we are the romantic sturm und drang. We are the punk collective purpose revolution, we are the black underground prime essence and beginning of individuality drenched in mythological archetypes.

The world is not lost.
What i mean to say is, people seem to think we have lost all credibility to all historical background. (That there is candy, entertainment, many ironic clips of people, as much as a revery for the past we do not have to condone its crimes, we do not have to judge nature by the irony and lack of myth in modern life) That everyone lurks around to find solutions for the future but forms none, is the issue, why is there no one recomposing? Is everyone waiting for answers? There is not one single answer or solution proposed anywhere, politicians are not actually talking content outside hollow phrases like hope and change for a long time all over the world. New and fresh is key media terms for processed old plastic or processed food. Its progress revolution climax, new, new, new. But nothing of what was passed is without vitality, or without relevance in any way, up for a return, to aid restoration of the earth. Kant nor Schopenhauer needed grammerly or commercial agents, their work stands beyond effectuality or instrumentality. What really is implied, if any artist sets out a program to rebuild the earth, then the politicians and the businessman can just fall off their stage. Its a beautiful stage, but why is everyone looking at them, whilst playing the song uprisal by the band Muse? There is something brewing, everyone can see, this is the only site devoted to it. This does n’t seem to make much sense otherwise, do something about it, here it is, file your project, gather support, restore your own neighbourhood. Its wasted to the autoperverted obsessive minute soup factory secretaries. Have a tomato on your room, if everyone does this you ruin industry, but not before that. Of course, First, this idea does n’t come without the artistic manifest, and then, the nihilism of you today does n’t come with having lost metaphysics in the year 1770 about. You prey on multinationals, does n’t seem likely that the “Multi” in national means that the opposite is to do it locally? Of course you need to organize that, we are here to help. But then you go, clean before your own doorstep, but this is used only for the hypocrisy that your doorstep is clean and you don’t affect things further on? Where are all the chickens who once ran over your doorstep? You cleaned them? They are better now in their cage sending your their eggs through the supermarkets? Stop complaining about multinationals. Start building your own world, Multinationals rely on the communist system to provide the proletariat, with whatever means possible, that is indeed capitalism for that part, but now they do provide, and you are against them?? The only reason they provide you with chickens or they have mass cruelty and ergonomics is because you did n't want a chicken farm around. You were such an aristocrat you thought a few chickens would sort of debase your land value, i mean you wanted it to become a lonely symbolistic esthetic marvel. "The civil have their palace" the peasent was booted.
You can’t be against them its the basest organism on the planet it is dumber then a one rock of coral. And that it is taxing the ecology is not because they pollute in se, it is because such force is deu to operate with counsciouss, created out of counsciouss it needs to think to intervene, and it can’t, because it is too big, and you are just leaching on it. You leach on it untill you can divide resources among locals and supply locally, transport will be largely lessened, crap as well. You can take pride in a locale venue or a Construction, or have yourself stand at the other side of the world looking at some ruin without a culture of your own, its gone to be the masterpiece of this era, the highways and runways of the transportation system, we will have it calculated as soon as possible, how much square miles it is by now, and also be calculated, how much products it actually supplies that could have easily been provided locally.
Its a long story.
But if you Carry on looking for the cure, and do not look back where the problems began, you have a serious attitude problem and we can presume the sky above you and your personal heaven is a supermarket sealing, and your biggest want is societies old tit.
All our existence of social community loiterers and tweeters about world peace and inferior gossip is provided to us by the supermarket. Without the supermarket there is no tweets but hard work every day. If that supermarket along with the bank who do not but support an economy of all averages, garbage or cheap processed Foods alike, if they are about to crash, you BETTER believe you are in luck you found us since then the artisan economy will need to restart, that includes when the oil is out, you only prepare by revitalizing, rerealizing your economies, the plastic slob that is left of the economy now is futile and that economy will be soon bankrupt. (Indeed what will be left of culture is a huge plastic lasagna, as written even in 2002. Many more solutions were presented in 2002, for which publishers can be held personally accountable, how many more years untill they break?)
IF all is not lost then, and you come to terms with this, then the solution to build a world that saves us from extinction exists, it lies behind commerce, not behind capitalism, the romans had capitalism, Greeks, any society that trades is capitalist. Commerce is the junk, the averages everyone started to reason with, to smuggle into the statistics alll the junk that corrupts the earth, replace it with education and quality, no need for anyone to looze, simply invest elsewhere, well, basically, redo the whole thing. Of course, this is no resistance to industry, industry is the very self digging Grave we are desperatly waiting for, go industry, we will change deu to despair in ruin, or we shall not realize shit, because we are all people locked in the same bullshit we spout every day with all the others. Industry as it is it is the death that leviates us, everyone knows it, only the proper man will be able to act as all others stand defenseless, then it is our day. Nobody loves the demise of the world more then we do, they fear the coming death more then we do. They are more afraid for collaps, the ecologic collaps, but we love it?! That is why we will win, not just an impressive win, but the most comical relief tyranny anyone could ever conceive, we dance out of black humour books long thought obsolete. Now we are back. And better then ever!
What is also more comical then anything, concidering the present discourse, is not that socialism and communism are, well, communistic, actually, commerce is communistic, it relies on the saturation of the proletariat, as we said, to the point where it is easiest, most soothing, to suffice it, after which the next step of civilization could be taken, nobody knew what that was, some, coming from Schopenhauer, -the opposite of Hegels Dialectics and his thread towards communism- even stated, “give them what they want, then they will not want it no more, and this will see the ending of the will to life. And the resvolvement of human suffering trough global suicide. One other even said we should purposefully realize it. Too little is know from these people, probably because in them also looms avant garde and the sardonic, a thing of which the civil absolutely detest.
Of course things turned out otherwise, give them what they want, they will say, yes the streets are empty and the cars ruin everything, everything is full of garbage (that was not bought longer then a week before) and well, all children will die. And they smirk. If you can actually say under this present world and course, all the children will die, and smirk, you have no sense of repsonsability. You probably are NOT considering to be responsable for anything. There are plenty of counter industrial movements ready to sabotage that society of amorph philosophy just growing like a bacterial puddle. They are ready. If you DONT think it would happen, you have even less take on reality. The radical movements will eventually succeed in shutting the whole system down. If not for this manifest. Then the whole system will again be rebooted. And needs to find its way regardless, if the whole system is shut down, it needs ever more energy to get to the same point and nothing is gained.
They can’t act. I seen it. They stand idle. All of them, large or small. Its up to us.
We must describe the established order, how it comes short, and be the avant garde in the revolution against these shortcomings. And in that we shall gather all those rotting underneath this system.
You will find below and above then, a series of manifests that is unworthy of publication. Dispite of a whole other unworth then unworth of the mainstream. –What i write now is not necessarily more actual then what I wrote First, because of a loss of original quotes and adrenaline, an adrenaline that now is lost also deu to significant forced medications thanks to the governments of this worlds conservative majorities installing no doubt one of the most cynical laws, to take peoples souls, most cynical also in choosing its moment. Besides in Dutch I might actually make a significant difference, here –in English- I’m just rambling.

Nevertheless it should point out this site is about establishing an active frontline of artists opposing men’s modern stupidity.
Find anything or file to our encyclopedia anything with the buttons year, era/style, court (for artists and courtisans,) empire (for objects), army (for military objects and armies, movements, militia’s) medium (character and tone and color), you notice the classical build of this site, now for classical manners i hope comes with that too, a site not just to rant, but to commemorate all of the below.
The composition of the site is simply the most organic summary of life, it operates as a flower, artisan farmers as well as artists and construction workers form the crown, the empire is the stem, the army is the root.
It is so that modernism somehow left this organic fibre out of the circuit and fails to function properly. It does n’t work with either one missing, and especially the flower petals are seriously misplaced in our modern gardens. There could be an option for artisan farming or nature or wildlife but for some reason it was best summarized this way. We would do best by putting Artisan Farming and craftsman in the Empire section anyway. Most factory workers, craftsman and farmers can understand things that are written here, does n't take a philosophy abstract license, i been talking to people fine about this, unlike most people, everyone seems to agree with me, where they can not agree among eachother even.

With that encyclopedea comes hopefull an entire bunch of surrealists, conceptualists or academics, symbolists and romantics, everything is there today, some are probably working on byzantine sculptures in Argentinia, we want to find them all. We think it is perverted leprachauns and garden sculptures of industrial produce, souvenirs or sugar drinks for that matter, get priority and in all this sugar drink craze you can not find anything else on the world wide web, very poor. Any proficient notion like symbolism or anarchy, misanthropy etc, has to be some kind of game, genius has to be some kind of processor or what may, roman army has to be some kind of market. SERIOUSLY?? Symbolism is some traffic sign inventory, anarchism and many more search criteria are all games now, this is absurd.

We say it simply, poets like Rilke, holderlin, people like Hans Christian Anderson, read about them, they can’t handle this “get lost with your art” or the “publish it there and we see what happens” attitude. They would be perpetually devestated, for this world, the spirit of the advertising alone would kill them. Let alone the cynical reality, you can not even write about that world, other then tragedies people will deem too sentimental, too broken, or a rage too provocative and surprising to many. We would at least make a site for them. To salvage their world, modern art is also not very much a “welcome to my sentimental brush strokes and pathetic cries” it is a testosterone, quick idea art, a dry concept that does not allow a feeling of woe, that this age does n’t take into account, it all needs to compromize that idea of woe, or it can not come to attention of any who are indignated. We are not indignated, Rilke, Holderlin, Hans Christian Anderson, they are not indignated.
We are apalled. We still mutter about, still swinging fists, but severely gurgetating black blood of our sickness, drowning in the frozen, bitter pungent particles biting into our eye lids.
But post all your art here now in the name of revolution again, and revolution will it be again.
-Surely to post your art elsewhere they don’t mean it to be revolution. They don't mean it to be other then stuffing for the subject, a fat Turkey on christmass to be disposed of and fitted entirely into the toilet as they had some cheap lasagna they had more interest in. They mean it to be entertainment, big difference, big mistake.
Live among the idealists woe again, those working in an ivory tower.
And perhaps they can even again in their turn share the compassions for the working class.
Maybe the decadents even, unfortunatly in this age we must, also from time to time beg the middle class to understand any of meticulous demands, any ivory supremes, and provoc… no, not provocations, how dare we provoke, maybe the decadents should just produce classical art again and shut up. Maybe we have to key down on that touch of misery or deprevation, ahh well, i geuss we can’t become Total populists. See if we survive. I geuss we are never going to handle the middle class, this is treu. The authority of having aqcuired, namely a house a closet and a business, is probably something too detrimental to many people to have a soul that is opened on the inside somewhere to pour some poetry in it, somehow they have n’t caught the generosity too much for artists to attempt it, maybe this is their ideal symbiosis. The comparison of the concept of death with the city of Bruge still did n’t see Rodenbach the author of Bruges la Morte his sculpture in that city. Perhaps what is an ancient old obsession of artists is no longer relevant to the middle class. Its rephrained from horrors. But we should also be aware of that, few authors today are still occupied in those interests, which convinces us, that they are staff from the bakery or the coffee shop blowing their snouts all over the countries and illuminate or fascinate no one now. Iconic drivle for iconic scum gutted from the sparkle of the ancient icons and the brilliance and sparkling of lively authors. That laborers regard themselves as poets and poets regard themselves as laborers, yes but so that it complements both positively. Many laborers today BECOME poets. And their venom is few. Their changes are nihil. Their decadence not apart of a provocation to the establishment, then its just flatulance. Many artists today ARE labour, tired of a working day, grumpy, complaining about the taxes, caring for a leasure or a vacation, nothing more.
ALso…
As a matter of curtsy and because this site is patronaged by lesbians who bite it off, we shall not have any depiction of the male genitals, even “real” art it needs to be obscured. The male torso is a feature of many classical panel but please if members could use their imagination, this is steampunk Jules Vernes style search machine we don’t want to have male torso’s pop up in every window of our little submarine. If you want to challenge Herbert Drapers fallen angel you will have to be pretty good, and why not some militia obscure war breast, we do have our doubts over Danzigs hairy nipples also. We do hope to actually get the proper audience because we do definatly aim for one proper audience so don’t make us feel very very afraid.
We are avant gardists, so we always see an exeption to every rule, we are not a school board, I wish the world did n’t look like a school gone out of control today, things would be easyer for such a project such as this one.
Happiness exists as you drown, you need horror, violance and starvation. Then you take a breath of fresh air, and you are happy. Sleazyness, depression, nihilism, in times of peace and prosperity, without art, there is nothing and when there is nothing. Only art, and the artistic method of managing suffering, sleaze, and depression, as the melancholy, sketches fantastic horrors of long past times. But this dreadfull mockery of such endeavors, into artificial sentiments, passions, instill a way of living in a world not worth living. Hate and disgust become more key to creativity, as banal words pour over the sensibilties of the classical arts, and when you heard the triviality and see the archeology. What was once was worth, what is now is unworth, or needs to be artificial, it needs to be seen as artificial. And if it is not clearly boasting artificiality. It is kitsh. Or they have no words for it. We craft simply. To sustain our mind, the world has nothing to gain from what we craft, we are already surpassed. We are lost in what is surpassed, we crack and scream under this, hysteria of modern, that is at a constant war with the classic. It can not exist, one can not tolerate the other. Indeed the sentiments exclude eachother, we should efface all that is modern, or we should make archeology of all that is classic. And stifle it, maybe in some paintings, or compositions, the classic, or romantic and symbolist, which is now all sucked into the name classic, can be an interesting contrast. To teach one to live with it. Still we need to conceptualize the modern era more. Maybe if unbecoming people and trash on a beach exist. It does not mean we can no longer compose. It does not mean every affect has to equate the excrement status. What is excrement is perpetually excrement opposed to beauty. And modernism is perpetually excrement opposed to the romantic era, or any classic era, but of which polar opposites certainly are keen to observe.
If you want to file your name on the ayris academy you ask personally and we will mention you, you are required to have a lot of skill in the classic department, any skill really, but some inventions, master lay out skills and renderings, vast collection of paintings or sculptures, something like that would be nice, its just so people can browse all art for any given name. Eventually there will be many.
The problem is all information is connected, and people are keen then to find problems in the next link, where there are just as much answers. Besides, the contradictions of the operation of this society, which splits us and diminishes everything we value, including quality and ecology, it does n’t adress the problems in its Construction of reason. Older people drive and take airplanes, because they are the highest taxation on the planet, especially planes, however, if younger people would rise up to the challange, they might cause a lot of problems making flying unafordable. This is just a strain of reason, a lot is faulty here, (maybe) but its about bearing the real disasters, and bear them completely and without compromize. (maybe its not airplanes, but at least its this way with the voting process, yes we are judgmental and adore youth and place youth before old age, its also a classical habit.) We have not only the hypocritical establishment to think about, the First user i ever heard of in the First version of the machine already used the nickname “fuckthissite” only the mainframe was up?! It did n’t even work yet. Where do they come from? The frustration of having to think in his own box, of not getting any worldwide featuring, also the comments are coming from the laborers that REFUSE to think themselves as poets we presume, the simply, modestly saturated, this is new –for people who do not actually live today. There used to be a time when the commentary only came from the artists and the hypocrits. -I surely read the contempt of various artists and the laconic attitude over their punishment, in various other ways then the modern indignity, if that were not a nobility to observe?! Many people don’t have responsabilities, no one even has any responsability, its always the public, the politicians, industry, then individuals blame it on groups, groups blame it on individuals. And there is some truth in that too, but a serious problem we need to escape. The early avant gardist did n’t comply or excuse himself to anyone, he stated the oblivious truths.

The Etherith Mythology is simply a patronage, it is an organic fibre written as a manifest against this age, it is a caricature of beauty, with Goddess angels and muse, in an exeptional story. One needs content. The author would wish for these stories be part of a revival of classical imagery, that in every supermarket may be the Goddess of artisan farming for instance, it helps to respect the earth, or hear the grotesque qualities of reality in daily life, rather hen just work on it trough numbers. We needed a new, up to date mythology depicting lifes most essential truths, this mythology is not the end all be all, it is simply a new beginning and a nice start for a new classic culture. Ayris is the Goddess of perception, born from a painting, she was cast behind the wall of perception to be known each point you are looking at, and holds the wall of perception from caving in and prohibit you to see you fall into a open hole of madness. She does this by travelling for each blink of your eye across the world and that for every living thing that has eyes. That means a lot of strolling at a gentle pace to catch each and everyone of you. One would really respect a gesture like that if she would exist, and, as we have read the symbolists and WILliam Blake, that or that she not exist does not matter does it? Good that you are with us on that. It was the mistake that got us from God into an industrial hysteria, debilitation of art and everything else in the first place.
Allegory is the key to free thought, in that it explores a relation, in mythology one between nature and psychology, and a contradiction, mostly in that it is tragic, a contradiction we in society are unabated to induldge to become the supreme triumph of freedom, the surreal avant garde anarchist. Jetting the most improbable out of lifes ordinarities to imagine and possibly instill a constant lack of satisfaction in society wherever it is possible. We already know this, deu to Jung the reason to indulge, and to indulge in the reason to debate with allegory other allegory, to connect symbols, makes us all symbolists, that this should be an undercurrent is not very sane.
If you want to start a talk show or a radio station that is akin to our angle on the world, contact me. If you have a suggestion for the search categories or if you are an artist or a project developer, programmer, especially if you want to cooperate, or if you need anything at all in relation to the classical world or you simply want to talk you may always contact the director of the machine A. E. De Ellendeh, also suicide related issues, it is a high art to this age to commit suicide since fun fun fun is n’t all this fun fun fun at all, and that is why we are proud to have our suicide channel, if commercial advertising is normal then bear the consequences, to have such a bagatelizing policy, such an owh no policy on suicide is a Gross hypocrisy, First you make the world futile, “then you say owh no why” We can not accept this and that is why we feel strongly to broadcast any suicide and also help those who are on the verge of one. If we can find a suicide we will have to counter culture with the despair. I did a very comical one once, i took an artisan old jar of seroquel pills i dilluted into soup to be given to my psychiatrists on their spoons or on door hinges of the psychiatry and injected in the fruit or dumped into their coffee and such like, anyway after some time i just took it myself, and i yelled out “a la morteille!” to death! Like a toast, And i lay down, changed my mind and messed with my computers but the poison was too much, i could n’t even write anymore, my fingers cramped up, i caved in back on the bed with visions of me being haunted by woman cutting me open at the belly, or experimenting with me having bugs eat my chest out, then saw an infinatly bright white light of which i concidered it would pulse at enormous pace for an infinity of time and i would be trapped in it forever, it hurt my eye balls and my heart so much it was pounding. Then i woke up having broken my computers and not a scratch on me. I later painted my suicide on the sealing laying there with a beam shooting out of my brain, and some angels with swords heaving off the beam, cutting it trough and bringing me back to life, ALLEGORY WORKS! Its in all a very humourous, funny moment in my life. It does light up when you find all is lost, we better go to war or, lets just not exist, but lets do try to go to war with any means we still got left.

A E De Ellendeh will have a lot of reservations before the persons who flutter his inbox with a radical intent to impress and no intent to debate on equal terms. He is even better at annoying people and is so tired of the venom to my person, spare your venom for society i am not worthy and its immoral to spout at me while i have so many of the proper thoughts, i made two barricades against society in my life i expect of others the same thing, goodbye treat others the way you want to be treated yourself i had it with such granny remarks.
Of course a lot of you will just barge into my door asking, what planet are you from.
Remember that this site still is in the complete whole a manifest, with every letter a manifest, including spelling, which does not refer to intelligence by any means, including the annoying “renaissence” in stead of rennaissence, one would pronounce a short e so whats with leaving out the n? I can debate you if i so desire on just about anything untill your eyes and your ears and your ass will bleed, it happens when you think all night smoking cigarettes then your ass starts to bleed. Join me, i invite you gladly, there is a serious amount of diarrhea involved, always, here too, bare it, and don’t dare to fuck off.
That we have female emo is only too obvious, since Tokio Hotel and The Black Veil Brides we are well aware of male emo, if at all it can presuppose the male noun in this context. Now. We would be looking for female emo and take a look at that, find out where it is right? That we do NOT mention male emo then after all this is only apparant if you concider male emo states about as much sense as revolution as the federal reserve does finance, so get over yourself, that will include the male emo’s, including even the last two albums of SAtyricon which start to sound like male emo, dispite some and the authors personally even like some songs of those, even of the black Veil Brides, but they are artists. They WILL get over themselves, i can even talk to them and talk sense into them i am quite sure, if you can get one idea come across that is not the next of a few billion tweets easily dismissed i invite you to chat all bunch and get some actual project started. So don’t tout your expertise on anything, many more absurd categories to enhance any kind of searching pleasure will be added, if for all you can be is ranting i invite you to search yourself a programmer. It can be done, but if you just spout aloud i am in great doubt if you can actually find someone to build the machine, -let alone find someone to talk to- what matters here most is a cooperation to indulge in more variety and uncompromizing spirit, and finding the unique underneath the corporate lie. By any means possible, and also featuring the more brazen loits.

Sorry to be so crude, but if you actually observe and have it sink in some of this Lines and the entire idea of this machine, it will appear most of those tweets are already long outdated, we are all walking on earth yes, in different directions, and tweeting, this does not restore or contribute to anything that is called future or beauty. We are sucking on societies old nipple. If we lived in the 1700’s prime nature sceneries and no ecologic Apocalyps was at hand we’d gladly be the one selling you all an Iphone, as of today that is no longer our or your priority. More our and your priority is for one artist to have a giant Iphone, and for every one in hundred also have one, and he tell you what to do. The other hundred of each groups don’t need Iphones he will contact you trough them. If you have a suggestion for him just mention it. Try not to get into serious warfare among eachother to gather the Iphones for your new shooting all and everyone up game is all we can ask for. :/ What a planet.










CHAPTER MANIFESTO ELVISH

rebirth, reawaken. elvish Enontiè

For reference we can all agree that these words and this manifest was inspired on a white dove that came to my window, the theory of relativity i read before that did n’t inspire me at all, actually i could n't understand it, i’m much more of a black hole myself. And besides. I could n’t figure a way out of this depth and subjectivity even before i read it. So the main things that got me out where Waterhouse, Leighton, Draper, Bougeureaux. EXPLICIT beauty. That is now miraculously forgotten, or even dispised as we realize, because everything, above all; HAS to be subjective, there is apparently no room, nor any consideration of anything else. Nietzsche perhaps tried, but his concept which was practiced nor his general mass popularity could not solve in the least extent the problem, popularizing Nietzsche will not solve a thing today. Popularizing Sade will not solve a thing either; we need a NEW insight on the whole thing!!
It would seem that a NEW insight is likely not understood, check, it was at this moment not yet understood, it would seem, as new insights go, that this goes for everyone and will achieve significent popularity some time. And it seems. THAT an APPEAL from SOMEONE INTELLIGENT would somehow come, suddenly, and still be heard, loudly, without compromize to the masses usual entertained and debilitating stances.

and here the crows came in flocks
there an omen, eyes looking from branches curled like hollow death.
kneels in front of tree

YOU, tree, you who just grow there and are therefore wise, make sure they understand this deplorable wisdom i'm about to share with vermint obscene grown from hysteria.
Some are like this growth out of the ground that wants to strangle you.
But they are not going to strangle every tree and every religion and every esthetic concept and every esthetic building in their deranged lack of satisfactions and their deranged contempt for anything trying to find a solution or new esthetic ideas.
THey just rant and spit.
Wear them off for me now how do i call you ahem "mr tree" well entirely mistaken, i'm sorry i need to adapt to my elvish nature and the evolution of my elvish constituion, of course you should be given a name. A name as apart of myth as there is no civil tree, then Evghevghyeiiwhen you will be called. I will then have to furbish a classical painting on an artisan stone wall with me kneeling before you and your name so people passing could see it, deities given and sprankled by an artist?!
Or give me some strength.
I mean talking to you and to your friends walls for so long has been fruitfull but at some point i would also like to get some results and culture going.

BEFORE BANNERS OF ART NOUVEAU

You are building this, cubes, hive, a cannister of opportunity.
We are here to demand a few things of this world.

First PLURALISM you will allow opportunity to exist.
If we say we are faeries, elves, vampires, gothics, angels, emo's, lesbians or bloody homosexuals for crying out loud.
let us exist.
They are opportunities.
Not everything needs to be part of your subjective reality based on a structure and the beliefs of the structure.
We are not just bactaria you know.
Some of us would like to use esthetics, ancient symbols, ancient or newer ways of ritual.
Thats the first thing we demand.

The second thing. RECOGNITION Allow us to exist is to recognize us for our names and esthetic concepts.
If a transgender can be allowed to exist so can an elve or an angel or a vampire.
Just opportunities arising right now.
And we are aware some people are frustrated because the world means shit.
Does n't allow you to piss on others for trying to be something other then just the mind hive and the mind of the hive, or for that matter use the hive decrepancy as the answering for your cynicism, think of where that would and has led you?!
You have a serious problem with that.

Third STOP TROLLING AND DISLIKE
Now as a part of that game you go on, ranting and spewing spit all over the place.
Its not because we are all different and develop different esthetic concepts you have to spit on all that is esthetic.
On the ayris machine we mean to insulate ourselves as best we can, so we are rid of you people.
At least if you mean to be deconstructive or just a general asshole, stay away before you sicken the atmosphere there too. Try to see delusions for what they are, very interesting I might consider. There were 2000 years of churches built for delusions. Likely we have to find ourselves a new delusion to get something descent for esthetics worked out for us to live.

Which leads us to the fourth demand.
Architecture.
You can not just build the hive mind worth of sloppy cages.
Some of us really like a reality.
For that you will allow the bulk of underground movements their proper architecture.
And we have loads of designs already.
Again you can not just build a maze of empty walls and corridors and trains and planes and automobiles without the slighest amount of decoration, beauty, or artisan symbolist and merit in it.
If we have our architecture we will probably like to DRESS how we want and hang the PAINTING that we want and have some of the SCULPTURES that we want we don't really need your recognition at all. I hope this soothes you and helps you and gives you peace, we are not claiming the whole world, just a lavish decorative palace away from the ranting slobs.
We are not against you or for you. We simply do not care, consider we do not exist, consider you do not exist to us, as if we love you we would be hippies or christians, if we hated you we would be fascists or snobs.
last but not least, and the most intrusive probably.
ECOLOGY.
Now you will never get out of your debates
as currently proposed by something of which could be considered a leader. We are developing some ecological ideas.
We will establish with a board of artists how the world HAS to look for our survival, and how Mars and venus and beyond HAS to look for our survival, as we are sort of a bacterial growth waiting to pop out somehow. WITH the technology to do it. Now this people don't belong on Mars and we can have robots do the work really belong to stone age people. And we are done with it. Our mission is to sow the gardens of the earth on all the deserts of the Universe and we have no other mission.

Now for the spirituality.
I did roam around for 10 years trying to figure, how on earth to solve this.
I did have a white dove at my window after reading the theory of relativity in the very same room.
That is, as much beautiful as poetic.
BUT IT IS THE ONLY sign beyond physics you are going to get.
THAT is IT
ITS ENOUGH.
Now i have palaces composed meanwhile.
And they need to be POPULATED.
Now i know there is a lot of woman in the shit.
So it would n't be that hard a claim for some in US and RUssia and worldwide bible belts to appeal to them. To come already come on step closer as my personal spiritual army.
Well have a nice future and also be spared death and old age. Just diseases that will be resolved.
Now come along. Live in a classical fortress. ANGELS; of ANGH, ELVIN come on, claim your street, and we'll build you a senate. The world needs, the SUPERB esthetics, and you can do it. The world is there for the taking. Divide and conquer. They are divided, we need not even conquer.

Now for the ones in the dark, there is actually a natural explanation for this. Its called evolution. It was a long and mysterious plot, but a hand beyond mere subjects and objects does exist.
That is without a doubt. THe movies WIngs Of Fame, the Night Porter, Dark City, In the mouth of Madness and many others treat of some symbolics, that our minds are tied to symbolics is inevitable. That was going to be a solution for the severe problems we thought ourselves into actually CONSIDERING the doubt of metaphysics and beauty and all that is human and worthwhile. THE ANSWER is now given. If you want to be a part of that. THen join us. If you don't. Please try enjoy your snacks and your movies without actually being frustrated for nothing much otherwise having a reason for it.
I was frustrated too.
I can give you light.
Which is the philosophical ratification, a logical conclusion to a defunct system of thought and culture.
But some do not want the light. A light that was given in literature and philosophy all along. And just needed the proof for a dominance, or at least the chance in a world of some five or six dead movements, to revitalize.
And it comes indeed with proof of spiritual signs and all that rubbish.
It comes with mythology and esthetic theory.
Now what more do you want from me?
LEARN
to DISTANCE YOURSELF from me.
if you have nothing to offer to me.
I am here, for a clear and magnificent cause.
I have to fight for that.
And i WILL fight this whole world
for finding a few people in the dark underneath.
Who would be comforted and convinced by it.
To more a degree then your lack of reservation.
Against a time without beauty or splendour or religion or virtue or anything grotesque.
Just building cages. Living corpsefying the past.
You are IT.
Nothing will ever come of the future billions of years of humanity.
If it is NOT you to conveive and build it.
So the few thousand years we had.
Are just the stones we stacked in our own backyard, with our own hands.
There needs to be no scientific arrest to any decay.
Or a conceptualized notion that what was once is not now.
YOU YOURSELF built the pyramids and the acropolis and the Eiffel tower and the Taj Mahal.
You watched it.
now you can make your own culture from scratch and a synthesis of all cultures.
But do not dwell on the vanity hollow shell of multiculturalism please.
Not night stores and pitta bars along with an international Mcdonalds. And belgium being the chocolate and waffle factory. If YOU do want to look deeper. We will provide you with a news channel to GET deeper, and if you want to mean anything or be at all significant in the world wide media spheres, YOU WILL detail a nuance, a compromize between LEFT AND RIGHT.
And as far as left and right is conserned.
We are EXTREMELY keen on each to have his or her or its own will. We are EXTREMELY keen on everyone doing what they want, in mutual consent.
That is much LEFT as can be.
BUT we are EXTREMELY keen on a right wing stance on arts and symbols.
if we want to use decorative and artistic symbols banners and architecture.
Then we are not fascists.
ARTISTS are NEVER fascists.
We sometimes get despaired over our more sophisticated and innovative and avant garde background. To see things that should be generally known but simply are n't.
And then how amusing do you think our subjective life is among all subjects?
Mhmm?
Now some of us don't actually want to be part of this media circus and this world, or even this life. BUT NEED TO BE. It is with no reservation I am here telling you. I HAVE FRAIL AND BEAUTIFUL SOULS TO TAKE CARE OF. WHAT OF THAT YOU DONT AGREE WITH OR DO NOW CREDIT ME FOR. Is BEYOND ME. You are into a serious philosophical mistake of a society. I'm just here to help you figure it out as you really can't.
As for disliking so many clips. I am hereby officially declaring and stand on the fact, that every dislike will be cleared, except for modern news channels and politics, i DONT actually like to see all these rabbid and despaired anonymous voices disliking and debasing and trollinG. So your voice will be anonymous, your contribution will be forgotten, and you and what you mean will be thrown entirely into the bargage dump. The dislikes for modern politics, well everything would be naive and has artistic value, if it were not for the modernist desks, let them craft elvish desks if they are so Goddamn holyer then thou. I simply produce usually dark and demonesque fashions and decors as i deem myself, unredeemable exactly, and not generally part of the indisriminate i have to be part of "my holyer then thou flock" i have no part of that flock in any way.

We are all politicians now, we all have to sort it out. So if you are not going to listen to the arguments the other is proposing as a solution, and if you are not going to propose these arguments with more nuanciation and consideration for the other parties concerns then we are not going to get out alive. Many of the meeting grounds for what troubles both left and right are in my manifests. Read it and get to work.

FIRST DEMAND IN ARCHITECTURE
You stacked the whole world full of hidious villas and mansions who were apparently entirely fucntional, all skyscrapers, and outdated as soon as its built, and i'm sure with all those skyscrapers, in three years nobody knows what on earth they would serve a purpose for. AT LEAST the palace of justice in Brussels was indeed beautyiful. And when YOUR age ends and our age begins again. We will indeed build an entirely new and even bigger wing to that building.


CHAPTER MANIFESTO EXPLOSION OF THE FUTURE

THE ABSTRACTION UNDERLYING CULTURE.
Potential energy of the next 100 years of society.
There is a potential of kilotons wasted today. Space technology wasted on train stations that could be biospheres on Mars just to have consumers on earth protected lest they should be dying from a bit of rain after their shopping spree. Even scientists are going "owh we did it for kings once, we do it for economy today." Wait a minute??? That is a paradox?? Wasting of spaceflight technology controls and consoles for launching and manouvres of space ships in computer games and too many pc's and tablets and smartphones. Wasting of more engineering and construction on amusement parks, among other things.
Meanwhile the idealism is stagnating among billions of voices going this direction.. We should mention Samaels cover art, Or Satyricon Supersonic Journey. Some people are still somehow working on a code of idealism somehow, but deu to the irony and the subjectivity, and not in the least the futility in which is regarded the imagination itself today. Far from a idealist cry for beauty glory and conquest. Main ideals are squandered among billions of voices, somewhere the ones who want to make way to a new society are somehow in themselves a little strangled.
Meanwhile science analyzes, but is incapable of devising compelling iniative in this paralysis of analysis.
It has all saw to halt progress. In the next era we will build imagination cathedrals for more weighty subjects in imagination. Maybe a light fantasy could always be welcomed. But seriously. Work on some tragedy, drama, ideal, simple convictions are not immoral, if we can be convinced of gay rights, surely to be convinced of academic beauty and ecology is not some kind of fascism? Decadence is of any age, to think there were no homosexuals, feminin males or male females or female rulers whatever in the past is entirely ludicrous. The very futile emancipation of the masses and females then where it did exist was entirely a hysteria and based on the wrong assumptions. "Owh I am also a subject so I am entitled to a male genital too." Give me a break. What is of this philosophy? There are males and females, also poets and philosophers, there are no subjects and there is certainly no consideration at all treu that we are all subjects so we would be "equal" which is contested in the merit of generalistic opposed to particular ideas, say you can invent an elevator or a new theory or write a powerfull work or simply invent a new dish or a new cook book or a story on a 200 year old culture or write a epic work entirely breaking the previous culture, these things do matter. You have highlights over the course of any culture. We do know what they are in the nineteenth century. And we will make a solid overview what they are in todays culture. Music underground certainly has massive legions of brilliance, books not so much, most of it is mainstream pulp and the books underground don't get around easily. Music spreads faster and is more easily accessible.
Not everyone is "the same" and that would include that it is not treu that "everyone is different" both these notions must also come from a lack of consicive understanding of Kant. You hear it so often. Everyone is the same, just behave, stay within "normal" confines you have no credulance to be "unique" then you have the "everyone is different" which is more of the same thing, everyone has some brilliance, some uniqueness, but don't ACT upon it, as it need n't mean much in its own right once again. ALWAYS relativity, no matter what they say. And one is stuck among those. Never meeting other aristocrats any longer.

Meanwhile it was said in an academy in 2004 already. "Kant has built the structure." Now that would ring a bell among thousands of scholars who actually understand the influence of philosophers on culture. If even a development of some kind in philosophy is responsable and no one person could be determined the real culprit for this hypnosis, then at least as an allegory we can say, Kant made culture into an autistic experiment -on one hand- and a hysterical chaos -on the other hand.
Opinions are related to minimalism and solipsism in art and architecture.
Avant Garde art runs over into becoming itself a decorative art, an art to convince people of the esthetics of industry and ideas, it is not fundamentally disruptive art, it does n't want to disrupt as the initial core of the avant garde. Rather it conspires now with the meanstream. Or aligns with its hysteria over what is art, where the indignated reader of the newspaper can admire another disaster, in this, art becomes like the traffic accident. A drama. How can this be? Rather then educate, about this ecology and about some counsciouss composition, not have banks suffice some kind of global housing project, and to have a reality. To be the deities of ecology and all the deserts of the universe, that much we have become already, when shall we DO something. We need to teach people to compose, in stead of delve money out of every opportunity, and make the world a barren place due to ergomomics. In essence money without belief, without faith, without faith in art will render the world a barren, cold wasteland yes. That is the problem now, that the wasteland, a distopia can actually be built if not for ideals. Once we built cathedrals, we can say, this world today is no less religious, ONCE we observe what it builds. It does n't believe in spirituality but what does it believe in? But that we are, means to convince people of esthetics is ever lost, we can stay stuck in modernism, or we can see, there are hives and every historical culture is alive again. We can go thousands of years back now, as some already do. We can assimilate any or many cultures, as vast amount of people do. Hence we need another decor. And another philosophy.
These main threads is what this manifest is about. It is not simply a push for a new direction, it explains you how you got caught through 200 years of pessimism and hysteria, debilitation, being lost in a thought. And of which the most accurate description of this place we have arrived, is In the movies Wings Of fame, In The Mouth Of Madness, Dark City, Equilibrium, Indeed, the Matrix, and many others. That that would be entertainment is hardly permissable to say. They are the real allegories of the tragedy of the psychology of a modern era, where the reservation for all authors to write a Utopia of any kind, leads to circles, madness, claustrophobia, schizophrenia, rage, hate. And yes, this manifest actually claims, that. Not in a philosophical way, but in a new evaluation of perception, ALL movements can be considered modernist somehow, and somehow also, failing to understand, the potential of esthetic, idealistic culture. Esthetic and idealistic culture as a use to a wholesome or fundamental prospect to save ecology, and to see the potential energy of the coming 200 years is not wasted on all amusement and fiction sequals and rebuilding every skyscraper a thousand fold. We have other priorities. And as the era of cathedrals is perhaps a thousand kilotons in what? 300 years?, the era of Skyscrapers is about five thousand kiltons in 50 years, this very thing can be calculated easily. WHAT do you think and how long do you think before Mars is colonized and a new culture is built and meanders all through modernism and destroys it? Maybe it is time to unleash as well as gather artists and intelligence to COMPOSE what that looks like. A random crap heap here and another crap heap not far from there will be futile. WE MEAN TO FINISH THE ARTWORK THAT IS THE EARTH, no compromizes to the last futile 50 years of garbage creation!! We don't hàve to live here. in this subject paradise, We did n't build it, this subject paradise, we never agreed to these thoughts, these subject thoughts, and if we did. WE CAN CONVERT!!
People need some bread and cheese, vegetables, some meats. People need some shelter from bugs and insects. Other then that this supreme value, this natural and essential mathematics of economy is utterly useless, and to sustain subjects is utterly useless and detrimental considering only that. Composition is key. if people are not a means to and end, arts, composition, they merely become the end themselves and complain they have no use, and life is just something to waste??



CHAPTER MANIFESTO MAIN CHANT

FIRST CHANTS TO RENAISSENCE

WE APPEAL TO THE ROMANTICS, THE SYMBOLISTS, THE SURREALISTS, THE THINKERS OF THE PRESENT GODFORSAKEN AGE!!
TIME IN CULTURE DOES NOT EXIST
RITUAL OF CURTSY OR CURTSY OF RITUAL WILL BE THE LAST STAGE OF HUMAN LIFE.
WHEN ALL IS AUTOMATED, WE ARE LEFT TO LIVE WITH ARTISAN RITUALISTIC ESTHETICS AGAIN.
WE MEAN AT THE AYRIS MACHINE, TO FINISH THE ARTWORK OF THE EARTH AND DEVELOP PLANS BEYOND THE EARTH;
SOW THE GARDENS OF THE EARTH ON ALL THE DESERTS OF THE UNIVERSE!!
WE ARE THE GREEK IDEALISM OF NATURAL DEITIES AND NATURAL BEAUTY, WE ARE THE MEDIEVAL BRILLIANT CRAFTSMANSHIP, WE ARE THE RENAISSENCE PROWESS OF INDIVIDUALITY, WE ARE THE ROCOCO MONARCHS AND MEGALOMANIA, (considering everyone has a Louis Quatorze sculpture done by the factory) WE ARE THE SYMBOLIST TASTE FOR RITUAL AND DECADENCE, and so on...
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS THE GOLDEN AGE, WE PROCLAIM IT, OR WE WILL NOT HAVE IT
WE PROCLAIM TO REASSERT ALL TIES WITH CLASSIC GENIUS, OR WE WILL NOT HAVE IT.
WE REJECT THE DISDAIN FOR INSPIRATION, THE DISDAIN FOR RECOGNITION, WE REJECT THE WASTELAND, THE CHAPEL OF NOTHING, THE NOTHING HERE REMAINS, AND THE ALL IS LOST TO STUPIDITY, THIS IS NO EDUCATION, WE WILL JUST BREED MORE DUMBWIT CIVILIANS, WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IDEALS IS ALL THEY UNDERSTAND, WE NEED TO CREATE, AS TIMELESS BEINGS, THERE IS NO TIME, FOR END OF TIME NIHILISM, WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF ESTHETICS AND FEMALE CENTRAL TO ART, THERE IS NO OTHER PURPOSE OR GOAL TO BE FORMULATED THAT WILL ACTIVATE A REBIRTH, IF YOU SAY ITS ALL WRECKED, YOU CREATE A WRECKED WORLD. AND THAT TOO WAS A LONG TIME RELIGION OF BRILLIANT MINDS BEING WASTED AND WHO HAD CREATED TODAYS WORLD.
A WORD OR MEANING IS ONLY GOOD AND RELEVANT IF IT CREATED ANYTHING, OR WHEN IT APPEARS WHAT IT CREATES, THAT INCLUDES SCIENCE, WHICH HAS FAILED ESTHETICS AND LIFES ESTHETICS, AND RELIGION, WHICH WAS DISCARDED FOR THE WRONG REASONS, AS IMAGINATION CERTAINLY EXISTS, AND RELIGIOUS FEELINGS ARE ALL THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO ONE SELF AS IT IS ONE SELF. SCIENCE IS MEANS, NOT AN END, MANKIND IS THE END, INSPIRATION THE SOURCE OF WHICH ALL THINGS COME, EVEN ANALYSIS, IF WE DO NOT ACCEPT THAT SCIENCE WILL CONSUME US! STAGNATION IN SPACETRAVEL AS HAPPENS, PSYCHIATRIC SECTS DEVALUING ALL HUMAN EMOTION AND ZOMBIIFICATION OF ALL EXTRAORDINARY THOUGHT OR EMOTION, AND DRUGGING THE ARTISTIC RAGE AGAINST THE MAINSTREAM STATUS QUO.
SCIENCE IS A CIVIL SCIENCE.
AND KAPITALISM IS A CIVIL KAPITALISM
TO SUFFICE THE BASICS, AND DEFUND ANYTHING EXEPTIONAL OR ESTHETIC
WE MEAN TO UNLEASH THE EXEPTIONAL AND MAGNIFICENT UNDERGROUND!!
WE REFUSE TO BE EMBEDDED IN ONE OF YOUR CAGES, OR WORK ON MAGNIFICENT BEAUTY IN OUR GARAGE OR IN A SHED. YOU SAY ARTISTS, GET A JOB, WHILE I CAN CLEARLY SEE, YOU REFUSE TO PAY ARTISTS AS PART OF THE SCENERY TODAY?? WE REFUSE TO BE ONE OF YOUR SUBCULTURES, WHEREAS YOU REFUSE TO INCORPORATE ANY INTELLIGENCE OF PAST MEDIA, ANY DIGNITY OF PAST SERENITY AND PROWESS OR DISTINGUISHED QUALITY OF PASSED DISCOURSE??
ART IS NOT SO MUCH AN OBJECT TO SAVOR, IT IS AN IDEOLOGY -AGAINST THE NOTHING- THAT ACTUALLY NOTHING AS THAT ART THAT EXISTS.
WE ARE TIRED OF THE POSITION OF HISTORY, AND THUS WITHIN A CLEAN MUSEUM SHELVE, HISTORY DOES NOT EVEN JUST BELONG TO US, WE ARE HISTORY!

Summery of Ideals of the Manifest
-Let us not forget, present analytics fail to sketch the world as is, they deconstruct the past, by situating it, saying you can not live there, or confide in some of their esthetics. Whereas today, unlike most deconstructive and analytic considerations, they will just say at academies "we can not talk about that" or "talk of an ever ongoing progress." the reason this manifest is written is to find a restraint, again a moment of peace, to confirm the bridge of what we perceive and what is seen.

Modern philosophy has ended us at the end of a dead end street. Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, as they are studied and their philosophy fulfilled it is clear we manouvred the masses into a solipsist despair and a hysteria for the new. Hence we mean to recertify the imagination, perception, and man or female central to composition. One must be bold enough to counter culture and bold enough to set imaginitive ideals. This is the duty of any artist. With the Wasteland by TS Eliot, the Waiting for Godot by Samael Becket, with the consequent popular culture of "nothing here remains, no future and no past" by Slayer. The Chapel of Nothing De Cordier. The Cloaca Machine by Delvoix, This entire culture of nihilism and passive deconstruction, nihilist or even "objective" criticism, has, we conclude, simply eliminated an idealist artisan culture. For the sake of composition and ecology against the industrial machine however we must develop a solid theory of beauty. Not in the least to withhold our own mind from shrivelling away under the stupidity of modern social media and individualism and individual superficial self gratification. We need to go to the great theories again and, what is more, REVERSE THEM, put them in such a way that constructive and artistic artisan merit is once again possible. None of the thinkers would have approved this time. And their passive discourse, their depression into some kind of presumed logic of perceptional relativity has us now standing at the edge, having to rebuild a language of form. From having nihilism, and a debilitated item, a gimmick of form, we can surely analyse what is form at last in between the classical and the age where a concrete symbol is the highlight of decoration, or perhaps a number on a house is somehow accentuated. I mean they consider an icon even, a running icon symbol, or emoticons i imagine, part of decorative items in architecture and then tell an artist he better look for a job. Go tell Da Vinci to look for a job society does n't want him no more?! This whole functionality opposed to kitsh, needs to have a sufficient answer, or mankind will be lost with the kitsh, eaten by Artificial Intelligence and left without purpose, or the glory indeed of an artisan it once had. It is clear that there is wide support for such a resurfacing of the artisan arts, however the media and the academic dogma's have sealed anything off from innovation, it is exactly the prowess of the artisan art that can't be debated in media. Therefore everyone wants it, nobody can build that media back from scratch, they have n't got the theory for that. Yes, the relativity and subjectivity have become a new religion. Culture however is a wide open playing field now, cosplay and lack of dogmatic restrictions have seen everyone embrace not one but all classical cultures. We are indeed all cultures of the past. (On halloween or the cosplay fair so far, but the notion that every day is Halloween or every day is cosplay is not just gothic or nerdy to support then.) Time for a great synthetisis in artisan arts architecture and decorative art. Everyone had enough, there is indeed a delusion going. An abyss. This modernist thought broke down a lot. Meat spouting from factories, the destruction of artisan slaughterhouses and artisan steel, porcelain (even the kings of Europe are probably eating from industrial plates, while artists can't find a job- again, just mentioning the camp guards logic here.) etc. We need to regain this world, and practice arts as the culmination of the senses, a limit beyond which there is no salvation. We honously think it will one day be possible to sculpt and paint in space and on other planets. To fight the discourse of "futurism" and the hysteria of the new, and the stale minimalism enforced by the cheap and practical is the purpose of this manifest. To develop a language against modern language. A language that is as yet identifiable in the needs of every human being. And yet is not anything like we have seen philosophers talk about in the past 200 years, exactly because we reverse everything. Michel Foucault too was working in his last days on the theory of "regression" "one thought". We need to learn to speak again. Later movements such as folk, dungeon synth, black metal and martial industrial have indeed adopted again a more serious stance of culture. A cry against modern factory and objectity culture. People are not subjects, nor can they express themselves in a new way without an explicit reformulation of all 200 year philosophies and literature. We are loozing the meaning of our words, the streets become anonymous highways. Jewelry and products are composed and sold as quality goods while they have no need to solicit a merit or value in culture. If we do not resist, and indeed don't express ourselves, we will solidify the creation of more souvenirs and other cheap imports. The past is frozen, and we conceptualize our lives, we may as well conceptualize the past again, so it becomes alive again. (We conceptualize it now to freeze it, why can't we PERFORM the past our entire lives?? Again, time in culture does not exist. We are at the end, and this notion is the only way to start over, to certify all arts once again.) Whereas we can say "everything is subjective so we provide an industrial base to society." we can now say. "Perception is to each the same therefore we can provide an artisan base to all, and an industry to suffice basic needs, if needed, NOT the other way around. We don't actually need industry it has no use. We already lived, we just have built a large spaceship on top of classical reality. In which we apparently started to believe and sacrificed the validity of primitive European as ExtraEuropean cultures." We can compose artisan farms as art, here and in space, imagination cathedrals for more serene and meaningfull stories, Meanwhile we can only see the meager lack of allegory in imagination for entertainment sake, we can see the crisis in space travel in these discussions getting stuck as in "why would people go to Mars" we can see the solipsism in conceptual art and the lack of the decorative nude in modern sculpture. Kant, built the structure, time to tear this monstrocity down, when we wake up! It is natural when you come from the Wasteland and the Waiting for Godot, we go to the "nothing here remains" and eventually "All is lost to stupidity", we can't continue this thread any longer and eventually just need to construct anything and accept the others imaginative convictions whatever they may be. But we are not quite going to go to mars and plant trees for the cult of Adidas or the cult of Nike. Though Nike of course, is a pagan deity but that is probably something the anti fascists missed. Time to furnish people with some different styles. rather then the basic astronaut gear and moon shoes everyone is wearing. We propose there are TWO realities. TWO "colors" Concept AND kitsh. You can't survive without the second, they are bounderies of your senses and human existence. Where you have no longer any sense of esthetics or imagination prowess and proud. You going to always want something "new" hence modernism. A caricature of the new. You don't even think anymore when you press the light switch and you already want a new unlimited source of energy. DONT take modernism for granted and maybe you won't love it so much anymore. Religious feelings also got transferred into dancing around Duchamps urinal so its quite absurd. Duchamp institutionalized is possibly very anti Duchamp, hence you could argeu, is it now then not time where it is no longer art? Its absurd, it was, considerably interesting. But when its institutionalized it becomes, considerably more absurd, maybe even more interesting, but also fairly hypocritical and also less interesting. Understand that. Enterainment, where every diety or hero is just a clown for your amusement, in the next age things will get a bit more serious. That does not mean its fascistic. If I sculpt a classical statue of Nike that does not mean i am a fascist, just have more melancholic and troubled tastes. You should try them. Because egalitarianism and just building everyone a cage and the same drink and burger is not, can not be the end. Maybe the fish burgers should be spouting out of factories so you don't need to deplete the ocean, the esthetician and second level ecologist in me, a level of human artisan art which is farming, says to BREED fish in your pools is a little more dignified. Now excuse me if we might have made some rediculous choices and presumptions to you but we had to reboot the entire culture. Democratic principles (unfortunatly) state that you have to find others. Hence we worked with what there is to be found in promising esthetic new ideas. LUCKILY then for cosplay and Black Metal to offer SOME innovation. Now as far as trolls and opinions go. You can write any eloquent and self indulgent manifest HERE. Usually people who have an opinion just subjectify everything, they are not open to constructivism or innovation. Its all just a dazzling vomiting of their frustration and subject religion. Its very confusing and to a philosopher you always need to think of it again and be reminded when you sat there, in your cold cage. "This is what I am, nothing touches me or cares for me or can be cared for. Nothing is aristocratic but my fallic ego" And the insanity of that. Is indeed unbearable. Because sometimes, its just not treu and you just need to have a little fun playing with religion and higher values. And sometimes, that notion becomes a religion in itself. And i want to blow it the fuck out of a human heart. And then, maybe even your sins become more gratious and malevolent in stead of all having to be twarted by an in itself obscene civil indignation and superficial hysteria. READ A BOOK. So as far as this goes we would appeal to stop the babbling. The extinction of the counsciouss of mankind to SEE and CONTEMPLATE the universe and the notion we may be the only intelligent life form about to extinct actually WORRIES ME. The HIGHEST philosophy is untill further notice the deserts are not the most emancipated and interesting things. For there to be forests on it would seem like an interesting concept, and the forests are not complete without the animals, untill further notice the animals are not complete without the artistic marvels of mankind. YOU CAN NOT disagree with that???? THE VERY ART of wanting to sacrifice yourself or mankind for nature is noble, but indeed humane and not apart of animal instinct, the notion you would die for the imagination or beauty is therefore the highest value. The CENTRAL mankind is thus that IF it becomes so eloquent and GENEROUS to care for absolute natural NONSESICALITY, and encouragous it. We get that from Schopenhauer; and If it is actually possible is another matter and most people are probably saying it just to propose subject and relativity morals or say it to desparatly say something interesting while they don't have to be very intelligent and still say something provocative in the general sense. In all fairness what we are trying to say and what is implied is that today "we don't know what art is" and "everything is subjective" and "everything is relative" but however you just CREATE a very "objective" art. A very "relative" art. While in romantics they knew very well what art was and also what beauty was and nothing was subjective back then. Hence the absurdity and the notion that your system is flawed and you actually indoctrinate others with subtleties noted in all you art history, in all your school books etc. This then pretty much denounces individuality and does n't emancipate the notion of a "hobby" to an actual individual and artisan personal culture. That that then also accounts for a nation and a regional culture does n't mean that there should be war or opression in any way but you can't develop IKEA up to a certain point, you can't develop highways untill some large asphalt plane is developed and left of the earth. At some point there is no relativity and subjectivity and you need a WHOLE sense of composition. It is therefore not undeu that this manifest proposes a TRULY objective hence UNRESTRAINED advocacy of all cultures rather then just the in itself intertwined modernist culture of which certainly does not have as much diversity as may be presumed and of which is definatly not art nouveau, hence, it is a paradox.
Or otherwise said...

We can try to captivate what is through modern media an infinite and chaotic landscape, we can try captivate what is through layers of fame and limitations of that media clogged which leads to an abyss of a jumble of words and a jumble of opinions, and the lack of what would be a fascist or at least ancient kind of propaganda, to focus on some key points, scale up the symphony to blur out the nuances that would lead to the masses running amok and running in circles with an unpolarized dogma leading to various smaller ever smaller growing circles …

and people would be LOST?!

I think, after time passed, it is safe to say romantics died with its aftermath, art nouveau and its death in art deco along with the suicide of Hitler.

Pointillism and impressionism weren’t modernist to begin with. They were a passage from romantic and academic, into the solipsist expressionism and minimalism of modern. And its genocide on everything classical as if an atom bomb was used, not in the least unwittingly helped along by avant garde humour.

While poor Jean Delville had to live up until the fifties to see most of the classical, if not destroyed, then mocked, gradually, even if he didn’t see the worst stages of that. At least the surrealists valued the classics again after the impasse of early avant garde in total rejection.

Further nuanciation was lost by the time Black Metal projected its ultimate provocation against the loss of any sensibility in the eighties. The sentimental synth songs replaced by a cold blooded nihilism and amorph production as heard today on all channels.

Modern then basically built the matrix of which we now see the conclusion. With movies like The Neverending Story (1984), In The Mouth Of Madness (1995), Dark City (1998), The Matrix (1999), Wings Of Fame (1990), all now a delusion theorem projected on the amorph masses in their cages, the question of what reality and culture is frequently arises.

To be trapped in a prison or to be barred of by the limitations of the masses to understand madness or brilliance, or projecting further, is deemed forever impossible by the substrates of thought ‘all is subjective” and ‘all is relative” or ‘all is an opinion’ whatever splendour it may lead to to think otherwise.

What we need to work on is project and craft each others different opinions rather then delving into the absolutist dross of philosophy itself. In the perceptual, the personal is truth, and can consider and suffice in its own allegorical truths!!

And apart from this, foremost challenge, to defeat the average mainstream that has not or sees no history, and has no notion of or sees no future. We need the cosplay and the goths to become the new world fashion order, and for these marvelous worlds we need to have both esthetic architecture and perhaps some ironic or witty architecture projects, BOTH academic according to everlasting sentimental as serious archetypes, as well as new comic and new iconic art.

But mainly intelligentsia today, no longer as Marx said, should not think of the world, but change the world, a good and better method then this polarization in left and right would be, not to change the world, but art itself, to tell people where to build the walls. To tell people not to mock splendour in art architecture or clothing. To build movie cathedrals – perhaps leading the way to more allegory in fiction – which would make the entertainment in fiction more classical and hopeful instead of nihilist?! Noting that a general humour or as it is referred to here -even worse- an "irony" in just about every depiction of mythology is not contrary to nihilism. Nihilism can only exist within modern language and dialects, it could n't exist in Sanskrit, Hebrew or Latin. Its impossible. The validity of these languages and their prowess in mythology is therefore above our own culture. Which is indeed degenerate to great degree. (duhh)

The all is relative and I’m not a star and I’m going to dress in shirt and jogging pants, to, all is relative and i am a parasite that will glow like a star. Not only in clothing but in thoughts. So often the relative absorbs the light. Projected the small upon the intrinsic female elegance of the human body in general, hairless for sure … Or making the academic and our female elegance, in mind or ingenuity smaller opposed to the stars.

The physiological essence, what is seen, rather then what is projected, always has less to say then the projections from above or from within, bacteria or stars alike. But it is what we see that is art of which Jean Delville said “Shines from the spiritual plane” into art where it “condenses into matter.”

And that, as well, goes for the CONTENT, of the esthetics, where Blake once found that “One could never aqcuire more” “Therefore a universal spiritual genius exists.”

Modernists lost so much in the lack of nuanciation of these in the underground of early as late romantics. And more than individualism, it bound individualism in threads to support or affiliate in some way with ergonomics, junk, rubbish, commercial nihilism and consumer apathy.

SOLIPSISM DOUBLED
The definitive antimodernist manifest of the right under the arts and the left under a principle.


What is a modern painting, or what is indeed the modern world if we painted it?
You could say it us more a solipstistic anti-painting then a painting.
A modern conceptual artwork in any case relies on the cultural value over the isolation of the artist as a renegade of society.
Consequently in media there is then a hysteria over the artwork, or a shocked audience assembled, to which is given rumour, to which extent the conceptual art has a similar outcome and statuture as the LGBT community, crime, pensions, retirement, health care, immigration. -All of which will be contested here are individual not structural matters, and are highly contestable in the nineteenth century literature. Even if one would make constant progression dispite the papers may consider. The whole thing is a superficial debate, and one that does not involve, what we will see here, is the complete hysteria of this debate deu to a lack of culture.
In effect if there is no principle or sound theory, and as the solipsism of the lone recluse artist becomes the culture, as it goes for the so called opinion, also a predication of this culture alike the Van Gogh individualist, then the masses don’t need to educate themselves or read a book, or grow nuanciation and basically, feed their own opinions with an actual sensory statement. In reality the masses feed their own stupidity to the media and back to themselves.
Why now would this not be an enlightened world?

Well basically because it is a mockery of art and society, in every way, very practically created by passed thoughts.
What is a bank we can say in this respect? It is merely and grew merely to provide anything subjective to the masses, because the politicians nor philosophers can idealize because of the individualism and opinionation. Media can only provide the masses with their snippets of information. Calculated to be a short and “high velocity” effect.

Banks grew massively larger then cathedrals and modern cities are -and grew into what they are- not because of some random evolutionary course of which we should be so proud and of which everyone would be today so very aware. The whole system relies on the passivity of the sensory artisan individual and in that on the passivity and docility of the masses.

If as we can see now very clearly the individuality of the reclusive becomes the patronage of the mass movement we have not actual individuals but are back to mass behavior.
They key to analyse the world lies in the code that was written in the nineteenth century.
Now the only worth of art and the revolution against a void hollowed out and trivial commercial circuit is and can only be a theory of friction, where expression is in accordance to the sensory environment pesented in modest, local, and qualitative goods.

That this very notion is not only misunderstood and will always as a theory be discarded by "this is only your opinion" but also that this poses a very absolute and definitive and destructive threat to the whole modern institution of banking, commerce, advertisment and consumption, tourism politics and art; is not only not my concern.

I sincerely applaud the wreckage of and collapse of all the same voices and ideas within this hysterical circus called a "pop" culture which overall was never a culture to begin with. Its debilitating adverts, its complete lack of principles in every way. Let us further explore this main notion in how it will crash, and how it is further detailed in every nuance and every layer of what people say, do think, and consume...

The very hysteria of commercial billboards screaming into our heads, -A notion for which many times you will be considered insane if you put it that way. - is a solitude and wondering around in a desert, it is a despair, that would be fit to explain many suicides or acts or outbursts of nihilism.

Yes indeed todays psychiatries and in peoples homes, of everyone consumping antidepressants and neuroleptics and other addictions. They have no cleu for a reason to live other then a chemical pill commerce will gladly provide.Given you pay for it, or if you government -which again is forbidden to idealize- will gladly pay for you. Funding commerce, banks, and the sterile all desert in which you grow just a little more depressed each day, and because of it. Your will was taken away from you. After the will to power of some dictators, a reversal into the void and the theft of your right or even opionion and the will of anything. Is it not so you can not agree with someone, but you have to state in your turn. "Yes, everyone has an opinion." You can not say he is RIGHT can you? Because that is industry. That is politics, that is the BANKS consern, to slush money to whereever you find comfort.

In this sense the left political spectrum generally denigrate pride, honour and glory, or offer a complete dismissal for principlese or classical culture, and it is not entirely understandable if ever they wanted to be anti capitalist. The entire principle of the irony and ridicule of modern products, modern advertising and modern art relies on the absence of culture, the artisan, a classical BOOK! A sensory agreement between smaller groups, to the detriment of the one large sterile whole today. And its billions of screams.

The left and the antifa would for instance then, in their entirely irrational fashion, state, that Ludwig II from Bavaria was a fascist, simply i would argeu he was a faerytale artists king, who built, among other things, a castle that was only now permitted in children form, for the "childish" masses! -This further will be explained how they can grow up into kings or forever be silent and beaten down the cavity under the staircase for very obnoxious children.

The left, in their again, irrational delusion, would say WInckelmann was a fascist, when in fact he was an avant gardist who lifted the era out of the decadent Rococo into Neo-Classicism, who saw a wildest amount of those most admired buildings in the US. TO FORM AN ENTIRE SECTION OF FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OF CULTURE??

And he was a fascist, according to the Rococo, no he had an opinion of course. Right?
We will see, have seen, and i will repeat this, into more nuances of this system and manifest, that opinion paralyzes, and the opinion and media in which the truth like stated here and in older books is shunned, for the benefit of hysteria and solipsism, minimalism and nothing other then that alone, a opinion that allows no room for anything else not in perhaps 99 percent of peoples minds.

This is then where the right gets their only and entirely mutual irrationality, that they should preserve some power. But in this age? To what end? They provide exactly the masses with their garbage?!
It was always a select few who composed, but the function of the rich is basically obsolete.
It is merely the structure that is not building, anything but occasional mansions with 20 flatscreens (without a frame) and 45 IKEA bathrooms.

Even the Monarchs living in arrested decay probably had to give up on any esthetic quality of their table wear and are buying IKEA too. "Hey, even they have to go with the time right?!"

Maybe not, maybe the time is shit, maybe it is time for the civil to get the duties, and shove the artists luxurious and artisan goods down their throat now too, after this manifest, you will find everyone will get it, while no one actually deserves it, basically this very manifest proves, that you WILL have it, because it WILL crash, and you WILL change into another culture, but what you see now, once you see all, is that people are completely hollow and fundamentalist, to the extent that if you tell them to develop themselves, all they will do is say, you develop yourself now, and everywhere you will hear it as only ideal.

Time now for the cynic to become idealistic then. And give you your deu Just for the whim of it, BUT AT LONG LAST STILL, the PROPER course of a culture, "whatever that may be. sigh."

If the civil desire to be the one king then at long last, so eager as to claim it with their votes, let them then maybe pick up the pieces of dignity.
Its seriously broken today.

The new then, here mainly in the arts, being hailed by the left again, never was the "new". It was merely fortunatly coinciding with the hysteria of science, ideas, new materials, and commerce eager to have a next sell. A quick produce. Apart from the hysteria and fame exploited with a lack of in depth recognition, now it was up to the "celebrity" and he could award art that, if in a gallery, they said at the academy, and you explain it, then it is art. Of course they forget that if i just dispose of my trash in the street, or dispose of this art in the street. "IS IT STILL ART??"
No. It is complete hysteria and celbrity status. Much like there are no more recognized people, there are only hits and likes.

Entirely nothing can be new except when it has form. Otherwise it is simply the mechanical idea.
Hence the "new" or "Modern" as they consider it the name of an era, is already deplreted after literally 50 or 60 years, they can't make another cell phone 600 th type and they can't make another Matrix 600 sequal, it has to end sometime. Maybe at 300? Maybe at a 1800. sigh.

Whereas form still proceeds underground, to this day, and could, it applied once again to history, with newer theory supply 50 000 more years of civilisation, inside the whole solar system,... The "new" then, this abject solipsistic idea, would be only no longer new according to the dogmatists, if it lasted as long as classical culture. Some 5000 7000 years more we will get. Cheap rudimentary ideas, IKEA, people playing computer games and have some thousands of spaceships wasted and scattered on an earth like planet, including all the biospheres we have as domes on top of already existing classical train stations, or more poles and lamp posts, we have to keep the economy going. (On earth? You think? Sometimes we wonder if at all this all DOES BELONG ON EARTH? WE COULD HAVE, with all this waste and dump and train stations; HAVE BUILT A CIVILISATION OF SOME BILLION PEOPLE ON MARS ALREADY THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WHEN THIS MANIFEST HAS PUSHED BELOW AND KEPT SILENT???? HOOOOW LOOOOOOONG WILLLLLL YOUOUOUOU LAST????

5000 more years and then their precious "new" will have outspent the entire "classical" "beautiful" "decorative" or "perceptable" art period, and then they can call it new no more.
Well i geuss they won and we won't survive it, then they will understand their precious new.
...

This simply was the hysteria and notion of idea abstraction and patents.
One could fit the classical arts on a wall, and see how this "new" takes to a world where the mere minimal abstract idea of culture is left.

It was never "New" -Technology is another notion of the new, entirely explained further.

How easily this entire thing will come crashing down is really if you would look at it in a reactionary Utopistic way. (As a mere thought experiment perhaps, if you will.)
IF the poor would want their middle class, and artisan and mom and pop stores back, they would be better off to just pay taxes to the rich and restore aristocracy. This way they might actually slaughter in small slaughter houses again, they would make their own wooden tools again, they would be able to COMPETE???

This is how absurd it is, and how big the inevitable collapse is. THIS shows you how dogmatic people are, not just into churches, but capable of any fictuous and absurd theory to complete into a civilisation. NOTHING of this civilisation makes any sense whatsoever, and it is how BIG the inevitable collapse is, how ENORMOUS the change is coming within hours, minutes; and how FURIOUS the renaissence will be, complete with the colonisation of the entire surface of Mars within mere years, and all this because you were streching it, strangling it, keeping everyone in psychiatries, destitute, drugged, under pressure, a serious cork will leap into the air at some point when you take the pressure off. And it is even funny that without these very lines, you can not even escape your humble and miserable world???? It was JUST an opinion of course.

Equally here what is of actual worth, one couldrather trade on actual artisan things, then modern money, expression, artisan expression, like the old payment of a talley stick, actually would mean something, someone crafted it, so its worth something, and NOT easily to reproduce, apart from the industrial methods of today, which are VERY easy to produce, there is no scratch of effort or life found on it. Modern money is fairly industrial hence there can be produced an infinate amount.

And what buildings would they put on it this modern money? All minimalist hives? Or classical "Beauty" which is no longer applicable?

It seems all this culture wants to do is deceive itself, and it hàs miraculously kept this deceit going for a very long time, but as this is a perceptual theory, people will be freed by just LOOKING at things. And making up their own mind. And the entire culture will melt, as snow under a collosall sun.

These theories and the main thread of these theories peers through in everything people usually do and think today, an in itself strangling of just a few defunct thoughts. Think of the sexualisation in which no frail sentimental thought or communication is possible, not between couples, let alone between same genders, Chamfort and De Goncourts brothers are perfect examples how men behaved in aristocratic fashion, this has nothing to do with being more intelligent, it has to do with culture. Now its a "bromance" laugh laugh wink wink. Not in the least because homosexuality, somehow has to have the upper hand in the media or any debate, and must be part of the general ironic discouse, again, as will be stated here later, we must ALL be homosexuals or it can't actually be TOLERATED?!
This is the black and white, entirely particular to the lack of depth and classical phrases that modern people are left with.

Last but not least is the imbecilization of youth, also caused by Freudian theories. It is, and not in the least concidering its lack of voting privilages, the last and final emancipation movement to which is left by the religious and ALWAYS religious adults, -even when it involves pluralism they are religious as we can see- a defunct, broken, fragmented, pulverized and pupled up planet. Entirely broken ecologically and societally, then they are ready for the success of the pharmaceutical commercial giants and the growing psychiatric wards. (don't bother with wall paper and hey, a candle is forbidden here. Both quite perceptually relevent to some.)

Nothing at all proohibits a six year from being given any kind of idea and being given the right to vote for it.

PART III

The moral High ground which polarizes so many today, is included in this very system. As ancient aristocrats vary in every conceivable character today in the whole of mankind, as artists and authors part of this aristocracy who distinguished themselevs and educated the masses (the aristocracy at first, and all of them aristocratic masses then later)
So does today vary the masses in character, and can all be thought, THE MINIMUM OF CURTSY?! As an artist would have that as his ONLY opinion. (some will fail definatly but i don't care much about that. (BUT THE WHOLE THING MIGHT BENEFIT SOME ACTUAL NINETEENTH CENTURY BOOK FOR SURE??? IM NOT GOING TO TEACH YOU PERSONALLY HOW TO WIPE YOUR ASS NO?!)


The masses are dramaticly undereducated on matters absolutely adament for the vital functioning of modern society itself. First of all they don't know Kant so they don't know where their opinions come from. They don't know myth so they don't know what ideals are and how they can be conceived in every detail of life, which SHOULD at long last confort and move someone outside having to travel to fifteen places at the other equator and lay on a beach or marvel at some work of art. They used to build it, they did n't need to see it, these days artists are the only ones who can't see it, because nobody is paying them to build it, they are all laying on a beach in Spain or eating the same soup in a luxury resort that we get in psychiatries.

The education through luxury renders all people today aristocrats be it some could use more profound notions of classical oration (note 1) rather then the opinional analysis, (note 2) Read classical art reviews. (note 1 especially newsreaders the most ridicule posture in that. Modern Comedy has long outdated those and it is no wonder, because they actually are, brighter, and formulate the opinion the media does n't WANT you to think. It would be catastrophic.) (note 2 or commerical or Harry Potter irony which kills all understanding and deep insight in the actual culture today, for understaning it you going to have to hold laughter for a few seconds, and then perhaps laugh in a very different tone of voice, i at least find this very amusing.)

The very notion of a lack of sensory respect not in the least is the cause of either despair, in the more intelligent, or peasent brawls, with consideration to the lesser intelligent. (of Which were also a number of aristocrats in past times incapable to outgrow the peasent brawl but at least some can be saved. Not commercially viable this attempt then. Nevertheless something of it should ring through and definatly needs to ring through to the intellectuals or what will you call them sooN, Maybe they are too threatening for you and you should kill them off. Or give them more medication.)

THis very lack of sensory respect is the catalyst for the opinion and the very source of commerce and hence, the indecisive left right paradigm, entirely hinging on the media bombarding the next hysterical argument trough a celbrity system.

In essence the center has no ideas, and offers no ideology to get out of this impasse. Only the extreme right and extreme left have interesting ideas, -But God forbid the center would say, do we need to change anything so dramatic, we should ever dare to push society into a radical new world.?

Left and RIght then. Either ideas of classical culture (which occasionally does concole or saves a scarce virgin through its theories) Or ideas of social revolution. (which the right then sees as ow so dramatic, incapable of reconciling their own philosophy with the general notion that such a perspective is individual today.) (this manifest by that, does not try to impose? WHere is my army? WHat is in here is perhaps a little anti modern, but the auther and affiliates would claim their mutual recognition supercedes the total baboonery of the top. THere is something in here no one can deny. Probably armies who create dogma's come from manifests as this yes. There will be no other way forward then, that is entirely your own CHOICE.


Paradoxically the communists want more capitalism. They have no claim to an authority or a lecture of culture for the masses, sometimes we think they want to keep it to themselves. And see how the "OPIUMS" of the masses become an entire minimalist scream of Munch in their turn. Even such a stupifying show as TYT has the nerve to call nazi's funny. "with their strange little symbols or whatever" You should really look at the TYT logo i don't think this artists is as "respected" if you don't mind me use the word monsieur left. But all that is basically valuable to that which has no value in recognition is fame and momentary amuse. All which matters to the left is games then, pulp, entertainment. This, if no recognition or respect within imagination is possible, is the very SUBSTRATE of myth and religion. It is only differential in that it is IRONIC. It is ONLY NOT in that religious where it IS IRONIC????

It renders, and very well for science to see. All reason as completely fictituous, as modernism is one entire death cult. The entire past 50 years is that, a death cult, an obscene, fame hungry, narcisistic cult of hysteria and devouring without any measure or dignity. Or come on. THe industry would shoot you if you dare to say differently. But the industry also can not keep to produce this, it claims its time has not come yet, no no. As much as the produce is already at the Matrix 20, the STORY of the Matrix is clear, the WORLD that we see says it very clear, and the fact there is always the same SEQUAL makes it very clear, but the supression of this information not in the least the running and screaming will be humongous.

As much as the person of christ in the past can be a person of opinion today. (everyone has one)
we see that fictions of everyday people can become caricatures.
TO a point the psychiatrist will say "I am sorry you don't think I am a very good psychiatrist" merely to discharge himself from actually having to understand the patient. ONly this discours exactly, can try to again explain it, polarization is futile. But the last laugh will definatly be on the psychiatric patients.

What psychiatrist today understands his patient, if he does n't see this reality?
Does he really believe all these people are insane when we have to describe them antidepressants or antipsychotics in a world of IKEA, deep frozen meals, and commercial "irony" and irony entirely yes. Its the modern world, Frued at least still said it was DEU to society. But you CAN exagerate; IN Psychiatry books it was still said if you don't take a stance AGAINST society you are essentially FOR society. This was when a relativity on advertising was still possible, alas, no more, we have been eaten whole. These ideas, would be part of a possibility for a deeper, insightfull debate, but this debate, modern and on top of everyone now. Is very insightfull too.

The ideology of Wrecking man.

In this sense providing people with ever new psychologists psychiatrists and nurses the effect is that of a short newsflash in the media in which nothing is said, -to the patient or to the masses- nor understood by these, and the consolation of deep insight is interchanged with the hysteria of an unknown noise in the jungle at night when you have no shelter or security there. You are also completely naked, but there keep every day, every month, out of every book that is published today, resounding more feeble screams, the masses and everyone is getting very afraid somehow. :)

It must come some time. Understanding. (though it could be said, in my won experience, the ardent, stubborn
and entirely insulated main philosophy is hard to crack, as if it is some kind of joke at this manifest or the worlds expence. Alas, probably this manifest will be equally hard to crack in 200 years. As was this hard to crack after 200 years, one mental breakdown, and twenty years trying to talk to a "psychiatrist" (if you get stuck on the action, being carried by a hopeless self confirmation, then you can analyze yourself going in circles indefinatly i might add.)


The sensory limitation before hand should not lead to the polraization of the moral high ground.
CUrrently the Moral high ground presents the discussion of ever more prograssing opinions.
WHat is an opinion say esthetics, needs to be for all worldwide or it needs to be an opinion. (as was stated before)
This is the detrimental and culture and nuance destroying force.
Then what you have now is the bare OPINION winning???
People that just gave up believing in anything. (or making themselves empty to get this one?)
And the ones who say, today, the future is this or that, are usually the ones with the most absurd causes, they get the most airtime.

It is very unfortunate that through generalization and might I add sensory replacement, abstrahation of senses (see the sensory ride in a chariot through the European forest on a dusty road opposed to a self driving, electric car on a highway.)

The old groups of culture became one sterile debate of which offers no prospect, not a single plan, probably any proper plan is found in a psychiatry, and in psychiatries all over the planet.
Sterile debates make people look for escapism, more mass produced commerce, tourism, and confiscating space technology. It is as if the Spanish fleet and the English Armada were hoisted atop large beams, to swing the masses back and forth. Yes then too they could have built a playground, this is entirely worthy of consideration back then too. IT IS AN OPINION. And one that today goes at the expence of anything serious an artist, it also goes against ergonomics,t o build so called ergonomic structures on top of structures that are already there, sometimes you really think modern people believe a classical artisan crafted roof is not a roof. So they actually build giant space biospheres on top. It is beyond any reason an artist or ergonomics, of which artists know a thing or two as well, would consider for himself or for society.
So if anything to say to this modern society. PREACH? and state your wildest visions, rather then submit to the one billion most hysterical, at which the five billion sober ones are now looking and gently smirk, and the few thousand deep thinkers who could have spotted me twenty years ago already are somewhere fragmented underneath.


The Essence no one has ever gained anything. Suppose you have Greek mythology, some very basic cutlery and dishes, you walk or drive a horse through a meadow, and you have your Nepenthe. Which is Milk and huney. Now what have you gained? And this may surprise you how little that is if you follow this argument thoroughly and the source of the hysteria.
With your highways and Ipods, you have not in the least built a modern world, you have basically become aristocratic, you have become Gods, and, or but, in what you believe you gained, novelty so called, you have aqcuired it IN THE HYSTERIA BY GIVING UP CULTURE???
Thats why you have gained NOTHING.
And lost EVERYTHING!

But in realizing the despair through Kant created both fascism, Nazism, and minimalism, the two ends and basically the Baroque and the communism of modern formal culture.
The story of how someone who wanted to retreat into genius music and art, how HE created the concentration camps by simply NOT writing them but simply writing a way out, is also a very paradoxical story, but entirely befit to hear for people who take everything the wrong way. THOSE THAT COME AFTER WHAT YOU HEAR!! BECAUSE THEY LISTEN TOO MUCH, ALSO TO FAME AND IDIOCY.

Humanity this entire time, was addicted to technology. Through the disparatiy of the senses caused by Kant. Or rather, entirely since 1790 about, Kant and the others built the structure. Once again it needs to come back somehow, to move forward.

Now basically one can say well I chose this house, and bathroom and kitchen, looking like an industrial slaughterhouse. And i do fine, and can laugh and smile, "it does n't effect me". And individually as it goes indeed there is some truth to that, man is rigid and has been known to laugh and smile in the most barren of conditions, it even looks sometimes as if humans, deu to this as stated entirely fictuous reason, a delusinoal entity which we can see, "i am right" can tolerate more torment then rats in sewers or even a bear in a trap who simply have no way into stupidity (reason) to cope with so much.

But as a culture now, you would be dead wrong, and as a culture, there is in its turn not only individuals, but also in this time, NOT ONE PERSON LEFT BUT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THIS MANIFEST??! Much like, there is no more goods but products, and no more wise there are, "intellectuals" or what will you call them in the sequal of your debilitation age? Maybe you should just execute them. THen we are both very happy. You would look stunning being alive and without intelligence, but we bore that a while, it does n't last, i can picture your future without it fine from here. Matrix 5 billion episode, with one giant sphere on top of the earth, people playing games in sensory deprivation. Not a single man on Mars, because hey, who needs space technology for that purpose? You have been talking about it for exactly 40 years in EVERY Science magazine EVERY month, but you can't do it, the masses simply won't stand up for their own kin setting foot on it. It does n't go at all fast ideals in modernism. MAYBE ITS THE STYLE OF WRITING??? EVER THOUGHT OF THAT?
IN effect, there is more spirituality and occultism, (and occultims and spirituality is there somehow in society now as we can see when we pick up the pieces.) In one band called SAmael, it tells a very straight tale, PASSAGE, EXODUS, ETERNAL, if you read that in the images, it is entirely very clear, it is EVERYWHERE said, it is EVERYWHERE UNDERGROUND BY THE MASSES EVALUATED, THEY WANT TO GO YOU KNOW?! But no, its all an opinion, spirituality is not treu, beauty is not treu, thats all kitsh. And space travel? Who needs a female central to the universe, which i believe was some kind of icon, of, beauty. She was sentimental and frail. You can believe i have to explain you that fact? The ancient artists actually had theories about it. You have. A newsflash, what will the next hour bring i wonder.
Ayris Machine
Finally a game to develop the World, rather then a game depraved the World of living.
Much like artisan craft is now a HOBBY, much like pagan myth is now PULP FANTASY, much like everything that has to do with the senses is no longer a modest need but CONSUMPTION, so much are arguments now OPINIONS. and ALL the better it is for it be opinions, because then other sound arguments can just be bullshit, you can smother it with your bullshit, and you can be HAPPY??! The war of us, who are called symbolists and romantics, surrealists and avant garde, is a war that is coming to an end, only fresh ideas can save humanity, and since the surrealists and the dubious rancor malign of poets at the dawn of liberty, we do not concider this age a victory and rather a total collaps, a final extinction, a desperate event. Victory over this age is key, and in extinction or when fresh ideas of real artists resurface we will find solace of our satisfaction of a long course of history. We are at the idea vacuum, when the superficiality of most people has risen to the political spectrum, where all the ideas of the industrial revolution are climaxing and also are degenerating to a final conclusion, that we are to embark, now, we are not in a stationary field, remember how the streets swell up with cars, this is a massive evolution, and soon it will all come to a standstill.
We know with every fibre of our bodies, there is the tidy citizen, ready to deny anything, we also know, to provoke and stir, to seek havoc turmoil and cry as a baby at the sight of riots. How will we ever bid our ideas to chaos, that they would, as Schelling stated, “be only chaos when they grow a newer form of society”. Ideals are the most soul devestating things in this era, if you are so unlucky to think them and preach them, you suddenly are haunted by all the worlds rabbid barking dogs and their voices you hear everywhere, you have nothing to back you but old books no one knows. You have to fight your way out of a swamp, you have to endeavor sentimentalities no one believes or bids respect, you have to rant and sheer disgust the fraudulent ethics and the mass production of convenience and tidyness.
Main browsers can not find what we are looking for, we need a selection and specification for arts and sound philosophy, we need to find the underground with actual avant garde thinking and not encyclopedic, thus non engaged information apart from being also information which needs citations, of which sources then need to be mainstream. We need to find real people and not the First gossip sites or the most popular sweet talk and commercial pages, or thousands of those pages and artists already giving up to get anywhere on “google”, drifting among the supermarkets and civil tidy neighbourhoods. We are left today without courts to flock to, with the fragmented weight of the entire democracy upon new artists rising up, we need a passed, a culture for few people to be accepted again and have a court, a place for salons, a place recognized and to assemble, all those who could never relate to the meak structure of babble… a culture underneath those meak artists and meak people who have no actual dominence, character, prozaic, poetic metaphores on the basic structure of life, nor a real intellectually constructed and philosophically rooted discourse, at all. Here, if you have no opinion on quizz shows, if you have no opinion on ordinary people, you will not be taken seriously. Sorry, a place for everyone, this is the place for the most fundamental artists, because this is such an appalling time, it objects to the very fundamental notions of art, and how it changes, or should be prevelant upon any society. Or how it shines a light for newer directions or destroys past hypocrisies. This is a site for the Voltaires, the Rousseau’s, the Cellini’s, the Sade’s, the Schopenhauers and Nietzsches, Byrons and Rilkes, Waterhouses, Drapers and Leightons, who all might survive this day and not commit suicide, i say might, but surely of who’m are hopelessly lost. It may be a surprise to you that such people exist today, it may also be a surprise they like to talk more in depth about various novelties and novel paradoxes of the actual life today, relating it trough newer allegories, a point is rarely made but to lead to profound manifests and a scrutiny for the World in general, not taking sides or unconstructive rantings agains left or right, soon abandoned and left aside only to pop up elsewhere and be repeated, what a fruitless endeavor. The constructive thought is the thought of the essay, where a topic will be rejected on the grounds of philosophy, leaving it to its philosophy, but finding a newer and better one, today’s billions of sites and comments with ill constructed commentary has no place on this site, if it does it needs to drown here, under manifests and vast collections of Works of proof of Beauty that you can never reject, and that is far exceeding in importance over your current fashions, this is a site where the artists convey to have Waterhouses and Leightons hung against commercial billboards, this is a site with a whole indignation of the offence to nature and beauty that modern society is, and we deem that is an indignation general enough to still welcome all open minded and profound spirits of past and present, we deem also this is a philosophy that you can easily see most modern lack of constructive unions is an offense and a disgrace. The lack of future, or lack of a resistance against this sugar coated depression, is offensive. We are not a site dedicated to the past, we are a site to have all passed artists join this site as a legion AGAINST this age, spare us your futile quotations.
Therefor, sir, please use the word Sir on this sit, or lady, it would n’t hurt ideals and the future one bit if people started some classic engaging in forms rathert hen squeeling up eachothers butthole constantly. Try to asses what left and right really is. Your living on a starving dialogue in any case. So its your call. You will give up on it some time, and learn to read maybe some old book on the french moralists to see what people actually were able to talk about.
That is why we created the Ayris beauty Machine, were beauty is luxury of craftsmanship and sustainable quality opposing the hysteria of the new toothpaste and cell Phone and razor blade and hair dryer every day, of who’m also are designed to break down, in which case you need the extention into a new wave of those, unlike the sphinx mystérieux, who still is and always will be, we do have reservations to mention this sculpture in this time, maybe he should have made it so it fall apart somehow after a while. The idea to craft lasting and beautfiul products is something not apart of lack of commerce it is apart of a lost self respect and respect. That the language of the essential artisan beauty of life and with that the World is lost into transport, new gimmicks in art and advertising is crucial and hysteria is everywhere is our accusation against it. Or no, we are not against it, do proceed, what exactly are you gaining? You laugh now in delirious contempt for my words? So that is what you gained? In a World of fashion and commerce, this is a place for quality to be featured whatever culture it comes from, and for artists to convey in a protected environment for constructive thinking, no youtube nonsense no irony or hate spewing will be tolerated here, but sound insightfull arguments, you can debate with fire, with cynicism, with all the worlds rhetoric venom, but pardon me, never in this new hive of reality do i want to see these, arrogant, but mainly burdoned, hedonist shreeks and cries… no political babble is necessary here, artists propose their ideas, you simply vote for it, here also your vote is know to all. If you sabotage our very important ideas, we will confront you with it, and prosecute you with our own judicial system. This is not some advertisement on tooth paste you can easily mock. This is not a World here where the cynisicm of having tooth paste propaganda in the World allows you to also be cynical disregarding beauty, on the contrary, we mean to burn those commercials for the sake of our sincere melancholy and admiration to beauty, one day they will be effaced and we will again be free. It will burn deu to our long weeping, our growing madness, and madness is growing in this World, it is bred, it is our madness, it is our future. And politics, Utopian politics is again soon dominant on the agenda, over the hope and change words just words in contempt for the worlds artists. Prevelant over subjective opinions who did not touch on Utopianism in the First place, arguments that it is Utopic, only to preserve the excretopia, the utopia to exist of nothing but men’s excrements, beautiful, white polished bright shining excrements.This is about the sake of the oceans, the sake of the rivers, the sake of the sky, the lasting, ideal arts, the concideration of sewage, agreculture, in a very practical, local, and artisan way, in a real way, in an artistic way, and the possibility for anywhere artists and sound thinking actually liberate the people with the ideas they been looking for. This is an appeal for all the artists to resurface, Van Gogh, Cellini, André Breton, Villiers De l’Isle Adam, Renoir, Bernini, Thorvaldsen, Canova, Rubens, Duchamp, Dali, Da Vinci, their thoughts and mainly those artists of the past 200 years, would all have not concidered the past 20 years, since at that time it was established or beginning to be established, we are living in a sewer, where we found the citizens of france are dying of illnesses. Its not stinking too bad yet for the monarchs, which we all are, but the stench is coming we do know that, question is if any planning goes into mankind to embrace a few tiny solutions for its modern decay when a terminal collaps is witnessed. Chances are it will never witness anything, and this whole methodology of art remains, anonymous. But there is a friction, there is steam and compassion as much as fires as soon as these words are uttered, may you be devoured as well.
It is testified in all fairness, as well as they are moments of desilusion, of delusional rages, that many, and many more are looking for these thoughts,… Psychiatries and entire industries of pure crap, -with anyone offering a novelty now- are built, in neglect of these thoughts, therefore it is even mandatory that you spread it, read it, memorize it, and give it to people who are artists, who are suicidal, who are sensitive, spare us the mainstream addicted to irony, they will change last. If you ever come across the main Construction of ideas we will propose here, and do propose here, bind them, print them, paste them on a newspaper, and have yesterdays news serve for a very different propaganda, send it only to the artists, the kind people, the open minded, the rest will change and mean anything at all to us, last, when the stormtroops have long found the plans and battle tactics for the new empire. Have children paste all our designs in newspapers, and have all the newspapers now strangled their bullocks in bleach, added some colors over it, forget your politicians and businessman, please do stop complaining, here you can finally start for yourself, you have no excuse, produce it, label it, sell it, yourself.
The site is simple, you file your project, house, artwork, your person.
Then you can gather armies, land, gather artists
Then you project and propose projects, much like are proposed here, more simple setups to salvage art, ecology and your sound mind will follow.
Once you have made more sense then politicians, the Construction and industry can pick up on it and realize your projects to greater benefit then most things that are done today, we don’t concider a job today to benefit mankind, on the contrary, most jobs today do not benefit anything.
We are hearing everywhere is stated, -even if we mean to an uprise with solid military wings- “shit happens”, let it be, the stupidity will always win they say. Well… I heard enough of those inconspicuous philosophers, what use has it to stroll along these people, being bullied by their powerless words.
“Shit happens” as a dogma against all the arms ready people of today is an extrapolation from the particular, to the general, which is criminal, insane, ill. They are particular people shooting with a gun to the sky and even be indignated it did not fall. No ant will tell the human being, shit happens. Shit happens is a sound aphorism for our personal cancers, poverty, accidence, misery, lovehurts, or other small personal things including our deaths or sufferings. By no means can it relate to cultures or certainly not degenerate cultures, cultivated by uncultivated people, or of those who do not even grasp the notion of punk anarchy or surrealist anarchy. This “shit happens” maybe in a World or culture of shit, but when sound or radical ideals are proposed, for a consumption hedonist to say its hysterical is, perpetually hysterical in its own right, they will be overcome, for now they apall us, to convulse in our dungeons for now as yet, in a culture who spits at solid ideas? So many are there that shrug their shoulders for the future it can truly be called a democracy. The momentum is lost, everyone is riding the depression, so many parts of depression are embraced by the modern state, the politicians can not be of much lucid concideration, it is fair to say the abstraction of modern society is as peculiar as the most peculiar dictates of deranged dictators, they just don’t see it, its everyone, they each have assimiliated with the one voice that runs the World, and dictators were always arrogant civilians, there are more then you think. They sit in their seats, sog on their pencil, and prescribe some more medication. To speak of unemployment? How rediculous is that, to speak of unemployment, this is not an active stance, they all simple stack more bricks to the economy, and the economy, is damaging to arts. But then you have loads of other legions of nihilists. Or atheists, or flowery spiritualists, everything in art was once a very different nature, apart from the growing dogmatism in which ideas evolved. A subjectification, a utility object, an object to be usefull, which is a raped purpose, for a meak person; which is in turn a subject. For beauty, is a virginuous moral, the gimmicks and nerdish technological abstractions, are the oil upon the meadows, if the meadows are cathedral landscapes with artisan villages. We have learnt to create all, to provide entire cities and neighbourhoods, now we will have to incorporate nature within the neighbourhood, now its time to do Gods work. If you want a neighbourhood, leave some space for chickens, and a small shop to wash glass. It may increase your reality check somewhat. You may actually meet someone in a choir to last ten minutes and you can’t hold your cell phoen while doing your each ten minutes of washing glass. The richess of the senses has gone out of language, out of architecture, out of the organisation of society, when the economy now collapses, the real artisan economy must be rebuilt. Thousands of square miles for garbage and IKEA, do it yourself, hobby, not a single atelier anywhere for the genuine artisan crafts. Not a Carpenter is left, it has these rosy smelly civil tidy gardens, for all clean neighbourhoods, but where are all the chickens? They are in hangars, far away, with thousands together, shitting on eachothers heads and living in eachothers shit. This is but a metaphore for how this tidy garden and its owners deny, lie, corrupt, cheat the artisan beauty out of existence, and adding a plastic leprachaun for the luxury and the radiance of it all.
“We live in a hysterical breaking point of the industrial revolution, in papers and mainstream media you see a constant profit or losses calculation, or philosophers who say people want to be more then a profit or loss calculation, the latter are even more annoying then the first. We would like to see both replaced with actual storytellers. The past hundred years DOES NOT COUNT, it is an analysis, not a philosophy, the only actual philosophies are older, read them, read something before this age, it is substance, what is written later is an analysis of that as a substance, it is a thin, frail, mere talk, no content, scarce grown meaning and lack of form. Form troughout meaning brings actual form, meaning alone is nothing. It needs to have and rich colorfull surface and a thick creamy depth,. The meaning always relates to those theories that fade over time, and especially today, but read even the theories themselves and see how once they tried to construct things, hypothesise, whereas now they take those original theories for granted, we live in the subjectified age, but there is nothing certain about the subject, it is one thought among Gods and Goddess… Read Schopenhauer before you take more Darwin in. There are other roads to different futures, maybe you should discover them, if you have, well, then we have our heart filled with tears that you joined us finally. It has been a desperate journey in this world today. Philosophers of who'm are drought information digesting folklore authors rather then system builders start telling this tedious tale how fantasy imagination and artistic rushes of inspiration don't matter anymore, yet you KEEP to subscribe all this degenerate culture, you keep fixating on the degenerate philosophical developments, the inferior developments like Darwin and Freud, they have spoiled all natural pride, self esteem and imagination and turned it into something rediculous. PLEASE, STOP,... COMFORMING! Change your rhetorics, change your point of debate, stop analysing this whole series of scientific industrial optimism and tedious positivism and start spewing something of the imaginative threads, in stead of whining, you can better READ all that you deem inapropriate, WILLIAM BLAKE, CELLINI, SCHOPENHAUER, HOLDERLIN, LAUTREAMONT, READ THOSE WHO ARE IMAGINATIVE STOOOOOP CITING THE DUMBASSSES! Stop citing the dumbasses and claim, with this air of self evidence, that this is the thread of history we happen to exist with, REBEL! The act of the regressionist has come so far as to deny the age he lives in, he lives with everything of beauty and with the classical architecture back with candle light into the nineteenth century. He watches this, and does n’t beleive it. He can’t identify, because it does n’t make sense, he values technology, as an artform, he values the wonderous, because it is part of inspiration and sensitivity. He does n’t accept the garbageification of the perpetually new. An age modernism, where that it is new was all the content they deemed fashionable, and how it was branded, innovation without form or story, here is the story again then, something to resist the speed and chaos of modern life, thank you for your patience. Apart from that there are a lot of artists where it appears they have no awareness of any of the problems this site proposes actually exist. It is hard to attain the least bit of spirit if we just carry on regardlessly.  If you put 10000 people and have them live with religion or technology alike they will show the same treats of hysteria, anxiety, cultish and social status quarrels, this is the unchangable individuality. However this proves time does n’t exist, art as well as technology will attach people socially to the same level. The changeable part is really the aesthetic part, this is indirect individuality, it is what the individual clings to. This aesthetic pattern is contrary to popular belief nothing that infringes your individuality as soon as you talk about it. It is the reason aesthetics is effaced when they concider propaganda, promotion, or a simple approval would be “subjective” it is very necessary to create new mass movements and styles, evenly so created by all the simple approvals. The amateurishness of these styles in a subjectified world is a crime. In effect all that is modernism is the subjectivism, yet all styles, impressionism, art deco, art nouveau, baroque, all of them can be renewed, this should be the purpose of a new direction. The subjectification in itself provides the current crisis of form, a crisis where people will display their (modern) bed, or produce a cloaca machine, it is the direct individuality. You can not concider a Leonardo Da Vinci or a Cellini would neglect form, their brilliance relies solely on using a topic, a subject and forming it, they use an indirect cause, a means to their skill to create, in this way skill and the means become the mutually forming produce, whereas modern art has no produce, it is object alone, without subjectified material, they are not about an direct individuality creating a pure social debate. To use color and form, and in that allegory as the highest apparition of form, is a skilled art, to use direct individuality is mere hysteria. It is in a consumer world the only art still talked about, it is the only art still controversial, thus dominant, in a world where issues that are deemed problematic by a large portion of the world are deemed actual, such as gay rights etc. As soon as it is cause of debate and indignation to a greater portion of the audience it is still noteworthy, the debate, as with multinationals, then encompasses the muntlinational or the art object itself, whereas the language of the artisan craft or the subject language is meanwhile further deteriorating. It is this kind of uncommercial economy, an economy of the wise, that are not led on to murmur with the main crowd in front of the blasphemous galleries, an economy of thirty percent of humanity we are trying to establish, where the hysteria is not the dominant issue. Where the aesthetic, the indirect individuality is keen to have an aesthetic war in which to indulge, to speak again and lash at eachother with colors, spraying in the air, rather then just having each our own square of black and white. We establish then such things as race is a dominant issue whereas the issue of aesthetics is far more striking in the whole problem of decline. If people want to have on their agenda again petty issues over serious problems its about time we state the obvious flaws in their whole debate. A debate the mainstream is fighting with certain extreme groups apparantly, without which extreme groups the mainstream for its frail and thin defences would simply collaps in itself. Of course the market for serious problems well, but thats why this site exist, you, concidering these aesthetic values n”either under or above here exist, or you simply don’t exist. We assume that you do and a culture you hate is just trying to efface you. You did n’t have an opportunity yet to shine.

Ayris Manifest Funeral Remains

“the two hundred year shadow land of art and culture” manifest INTRODUCTION
It is no longer "J'accuse" as in, “I humble Jean Jaqcues Rousseau accuse the World.” It is,... “The World accuses me, the World in its clear evidence of being beyond the brink of all demise, accuses me, the simple, hedonist me, thriving of ONE machine, an intricately connected and very simple machine, it is as one simple family, some factories, some roads, some advertising billboard, some chicken broilers and ranches, this entire very simple basic system provides everyone of their wealth and basic livelyhood, so the World, accuses me for living, and accuses any one else that is detrimental as that World that is under threat, it even threatens the ones that don’t care, which is definatly an advantage, of which we talk about later. That we are too many is no excuse, the barren land of death, garbage slushing out of the tvscreens worldwide, in magazines and on billboards, societies talk becoming more pale and void, the philosophy has drained from the worlds culture, the collapse not of the empire, but the collapse trough the depletion of the arts, and we wonder where the garbage comes from, We are depressed, we take pills, and we wonder where the depression comes from, ideological demise does not matter no more in psychiatries, and we keep wondering where the depression comes from, a holy body of christ has not as much methodic nihilism as psychiatric drugs, to take pills for your soul, (As if that word would sound too heavy to be part of some so called new psychiatric scent of the same soul. My have we become scientific, i have not heard of analysis of who you are and what you stand for lately, but you need french moralists for that.) your conviction, that is you, how much resiliance does an average man have, none, according to the disease manuals… Oceans nearly dead, rivers poisoned and suffocating the last life of the oceans, yes its treu, its that bad, Europe asking Brazil to stop cutting the trees, and the cattle barons and oil palm barons rightfully killing off environmentalists, because Europe is being hypocritical anyway. It can not even protect the few little forests it has in between factories. KILL the environmentalists, if they want to hang from sculptures or boats, shoot them. And meanwhile, for all this garbage, no one knows of any solution, well there is a cause, and two hundred years of sensory and experience degenerating evolution, and in that, as we argue, is probably the solution, as the drama is in this 200 year evolution, there is a lot of drama, no lone hippies should succeed to contest oil palm barons or anyone, its impossible, the sheepishness of it merely strokes gently the counsciouss of the civil, and they can join socially sticking at eachothers filthy bodies in common indignation. The motion that is driving the society has been concocted by philosophers and writers all along, the object of knowledge, the analysis rather then the word of verse. A solution as Michel Foucault said just as well, regression, and many modern movements have done it since he stated it just before his death, regression, that was 1984 to assume the cultural identity of previous culture, and double all technology and production towards the future, with NONE of the wastefulness. How? stop for the love of beauty, talking about standing up to governments and industry, you merely please will stop giving them attention. They never made sense not since the french revolution, poking up “unemployment” there, saving a car factory here, they are just increasing the weight, the burden of profit. The treu reality is a organized system of residences, live stock, chickens, milk cows, grains, i’m sorry to say its nota n Ipod or anything like that which constitutes the real World, and the stench of all that will come near you again, and you will respect the stench again, or you be gasping on an oil poluted beach anywhere very soon, be my geust.

Start an aristocratisation, Louis quatorze never needed a new bed every year. He was more sober then most of you. So we baptize all of you, to be an aristocratic elite... For that you instantly as you notice, heal of your despair to be “a mere citizen” a ‘mere animal” and now indulge in the superficialities superb and likewise detrimental to, the greater arts and the more qualitative richess and luxuries of decorative arts, with it a World exists that is sustainable. How have you in this past time been miserable in the concideration that kings were not extraordinary people but base like yourself, whereas they were base like yourself having spent their money in a more extraordinary way then anyone today would have the right to. There are three kinds of decadence, the decadence of artists, in advance ruined to mean anything in a society that is too narrow minded, where they spew on society, a society that, in advance needs a lot of spit, and where the artists identify with the emperial fatal lady to destroy and penitilize society. And there is the modern decadence to show of sloth, an ease of consumption articles inadvertidly pascifying all, one best be a bit more modest about holidays in Italy or dying your nails on a terrace. We are at war, society is sick, the second form of decadence is unacceptable, the First should come with a descent set of rancour, concidering all the ease. We would branded conservatives if we did not spit on morals, much like the ones to post their daily consumer eases and luxuries.
No, we all need to be kings, need to know the taste they knew, and they were thought to be, they were ordinary people, as anyone gives birth to an ordinary man, which ordinary man can be exeptional or dissapointing, but in extraordinary expections we will mean more then in the current breeding of depression. As a Winston Churchil, right now, for the danger lurking only miles at the horizon just over the water, we should be travelling all the factories calling upon everyone, to work harder for the challenge ahead. But there is no such voice today. There is no such urgent strain pointed out today. Shallow people, that complain of things being bad as shrug their shoulders, none are there triumphators, none younger man are more angry. Non book is written, that takes the whole civilisation up into its stranglehold and takes it beyond decay.
For the depletion of resources, by industry purposefully producing products that easily deteriorate, could we just pay a tax to them so they keep their wealth, but we get lasting products? Rancor in our ways, we are prepared to do anything, set aside ideal or common sense as long as this World today and its degenerate standards end. We live, in the hysteria, of the industrial revolution, the hysterical phase, of hysterical arts as hysterical gadgets, let us not forget that, never has there been a culture without even an idea what that culture was, without it being properly understood ho wan exeptional crime it is to live today, so let us bear that in mind, to strengthen a philosophy for getting out of that culture, as an addict tries to build strength for his impending detoxification. Post modernism once, now the ideas of modernism or postmodernism are even filtered out, it was already proposed in modernism, novelty, if the title is no longer modern it retains the new in itself, a new and sick new, and as such, without to exist. Romantics and any culture was an attitude, this era has medication for an attitude. Because it is new, and character is old, drug out the ever old with the ever new.
We are not here to attack, or to take over, we are here to resent, in a pit of resentment, even ourselves when need to, it is called proud, and we look at everything outside our pit of resentment, and we see nothing but ruin.
We are artists, which means we don’t attack, we claim the Legal right for the book of civilisation, of which everything comes from a book. We also claim that any workable society is such an artform, a book, therefore we don’t need to attack anything, from attack grows polarisation, therefore do not attack communists nor fascists, just ask them, where shall we build the walls, and if the fascists want to build concentration camps, ask the communists where to build the escape holes underneath, if the communists tell you the people must be freed, ask the fascist what the demands are upon the free. Debating as they both do today will get us nothing built, and building is the existence of the species, i fit does not build anything, or build things that do not really exist, it is nothing. And what it builds is its ritual, and i fit does n’t have a ritual, it is nothing, and its buildings and architecture will not exist. Because now we are free, and there is genocides, on beauty, and with it, on the rivers, oceans, forests, on the land, on the roads, on the peace and silence and tranquility, on the care and woe of the colors and odours of life, on the carefull ritual of life. And silence as beauty always fought along the rivers and oceans, if they are not clean, a beautiful art can not exist, if they are filthy, a hysteria over technology will exist, apart from all mentions industry and artisan livfe blended into kitsh, which is a breach of common logick.
Democracy is the ecologic genocide deu to laziness, so we do have our own set of doubts about it. The modern democracy rests under the communist stance that the “people should be supplied in every need, to end the dialectic process”, which we doubt is to be treu in this particular case of present day. Eduard Von Hartmann said, “give people what they want, then they will not want it no more.” This is much closer to the truth, bei t commercial advertising might see people as the only sustainance keeping them from suicide, providing the next novelty. We don’t mean to be moraly indignated, we are as disgusting as we are disgusted, it starts to wreck our own mind to be confronted with this much stupidity, we don’t even believe intelligence or morals exist. We believe if criminal tyranny can heal the World, work with it, so far our aim would be to go along with governments and industry for these massive projects. But selfishness more then love is blind, numbers on banc accounts and industry growth producing more garbage is part of a twisted self respect today, committing crimes that could destroy the World ten times over. Work with what moves along.
If not, everything dies, thats a delicious power to artists that artists never had, their insanity and them been in the gutter for their work is only hightened with the present value of their work deu to celebrity status, but after being dead celibrities, now they will be the power, the people have evolved all of their ideas into a criminal monster, ideas of the inventors of modernism, the conceptualists and the expressionists, moving along in ever less likely proof of quality or meaning. Their work is a craft, therefore it is only an amount of time and means, and for the senses of the individual coming across it, money or celebrity should be cleansed from this value, the value of it exists opposed to the celebrity, a celebrity is an unrecognized influence to many, a recognized influence is a deep suffering, a deep engagement and a profound new affection learnt for human kind. Van Gogh suffered of the Holland landscapes to be ruined, this is the essence of his work, it never mentioned, it could not be mentioned or he could not be celebrity, so he is not recognized or there would bes o much resentment for not doing anything, and because nobody is doing anything now the artist and many have been forthcoming, that are, rancour. If a Van Gogh collects 5 million Dollars people understand it suddenly. Money corrupts recognition, if a person has beautiful artisan palaces, and produces worthwhile articles, there can not be a question for needing more money… Now the celebrity status is the only economic power sucking up artists, preying on their death, as their profound beauty, the recognition itself, and those real ways in which is suffered, can not be stated, it would contrast the commercials too much, the hypocrisy would bear naked. The real talent of them is awe, its not something you can pay for, nor something you can preserve in this society, patching up every bit of scaffolding paint, stroking and desinfecting every bit of mold, and not respect this awe in the society of present day, or rather, not having noticed this society is a disgrace to awe, in that society, all prices on art are futile, even worse, all art should be burnt, for the eventual manifest that humanity today is left with its skyscrapers and its barren walls. If you do not recognize suffering today. Then you can not celebrate your past. The present suffers from the disease that it does not want to exist, it suffers from an existophobia.
Before polarising on this matter, that it should not be, we can safely say, we can not have 200 more years of a rise in car sales, not 200 more years of increase in psychiatric medicines, not twohundred more years of keeping the classics in the museums. And before this idea runs cold on the bigotting debates in mainstream news broadcast, capable to stifle any grand ideal or a disaster and a sentiment to care for, let alone to be enraged, instantly shrivelling any active rage… Before that, before it to shrivel, we have finally found a truth that will remain bitter for 200 years, or untill it collapses then soon. It is predominantly by what we call mainstream, that this bitter observation is not made, and the artistic and philosophical World, is strangled as the technological marvel of mankind, the people who built todays World, -along with philosophers and artists- is strangled truly, with current people keeping their jobs simply disrespecting the ways of respect and loyalty to their craft of the previous generation, and they of the generation before that. Rather then to find us a newer and more sustainable World, it is the last of the shifting baseliness, where we get accustomed to the complete collaps, or we shift a baseline back. However, if the mainstream would think, it could already see its World growing bleak, its ideas drained, its venom and character hollowed out, and for the hollow Shell that it becomes, it shrivels and bursts, it is apparant. It does not have the skill this tidy person, to truly shine as civilisations should shine, it is, a newer civilisation that it will give birth to. We welcome this disaster, for the power it gives us, yes, with severe dislike we can say this, with an ultimate disdain for the so called rights people have gained. They have no rights we envy, we have lived none of their rights and wanted none. They are crimes. We award the greatest criminals to put society to the brink of extinction the prize, that alone will see change come trough.
We do not need much imagination to remember the papers full of the treu air in the hollow Shell of disaster, not the real “state” of the society, it does not talk about that, it is a lack of inspiration, it is still “working” we are still working every day to make it worse, and if we made it better, we would all be glowing of optimism and exhiliration rather but darkening of depression, there are ages when that was treu, we had a golden age from 1950 up to now, and what arts have developed? Criticism on consumption is art?? Do you concider a vote for a politician an act of rebellion to the other party of any kind? One does not become art by becoming part of the problem, leaving out any chance for the artisan debate, which is at the root of both the problems of modern art, and modern consumption, owh wait, these modern idiots are so pluralist i can not call modern art a problem (must be something to do with the old enteratete kunstler mixed up with the “problem” of the jewish existence some time ago. The hypocrisy of the present is still very much founded on a misplaced indignation for the hypocrisy of the fascists, which ultimatly were the same civil people.) I think it was Duchamps INTENTION to be a problem. This is just one more proof of how civil and tidy everything must be. And of a significant catholic styled stubberness to a new doctrine this World today, the doctrine of atheism is widely accepted, even minimal concepts are widely conceived in the vatican or the islamic World, skyscrapers abundant, the ritual of life dissolved, what use religions make if not to make a case of candle light, ritual, the artisan. It would be the greatest reevaluation of religion The doctrine is the simple machine, to further extrapolate all the resources, to make them a good that can be used for souvenirs of cultures, and deem any economic benefit usefull apart from its factual contribution to the modest daily goods a very primitive culture defines to be apropriate. A culture that is more “primitive” is not necessarily wrong in its demarkation of luxury and the per capita ecologic footprint. We live off principles, we have lived off principles for millenia, and the greatest principle and one we lack complete is beauty. We have mixed up those notions of wealth, have everything decide by a mainstream economy, where there allegedly no depraved or excuisite, as also we have not seen the warnings from the primitivists, and not really concidered the serious lack of standards of some allegedly pagan interests, those were really out of line, modernism may be dispickable where it defends blind progress, as surely today is blind progress, as in an excretion of all kinds of technological marvels, but it is even more doubtfull where it represents a view to a “heathen holy war” even that was commercialized, i think heathens would have been indeed very serious about a holy war today if they saw the gigantic waste dump and the poisoned rivers, Neptune himself would have fired anyone woman or child to suicide bombings concidering what is done to the oceans, the venom of the islamic is dorment in all people, and with the mythologies of the ancient, including for instance a mythology that had an old wise god be repeatedly mocked and spat on, whereafter he summoned all the Gods to seek revenge on mankind, and still not advocate violance or mayhem, yes, the Egyptians, all those Mythologies today, if they could only because of a reviving of the imagination be so strong again allegorically as they ever did, then more resistence to the shit happens base allegory culture might have come to pass lately.
The mainstream does not like bitterness. It sedates it, its a disease, happiness, novelty, saturation, trivial personal lives circumstances make out the state, saturation of the hunger and the personal needs make out the politics. Nevertheless the World accuses us, and not when we strap the belt, or are working so hard as in Churchills time when he shouted in all the factories we should work, and everyone was informed of the black tyrantannic nightmare fascism, no, we are not informed, we are not working hard, -exept maybe those making supermarket shelves which need to be replaced next year for a newer style- we are not working on our vigilance of hunger and our pristine and well concidered principles, there are none, people say “shit happens” “too many people” “we know its going bad, write a happy story”
Shit happens and these exact systems of thought, truly scramble our brain and we go, owh the United Kingdom had a salt monopoly, why protest Ghandi, shit happens, owh the parisians were in stinking sewers washing an aristocrats gloves, shit happens parisians. It renders both the mind as the action completely useless. Then it is rendered useless to write the classical proze solidified with the principles that also advocate the ideas of being honoustly moved by words or the understanding of making grand gestures. Grand gestures, all that is left is to become psychotic, by standards prescribed by mediocre people, among the mediocre and the democracies billions of fragmented people, all indulging in their pop culture, the usual brilliance and excellence is described as a feature of madness, an exaltation of the specific, an intoxication of the specific, or even the general, the intoxication is a disease, as yet we need those to become poisoned by life.. Within verse and arts it was once excellence, now within a pop culture there can be only normality or insanity. What a disgrace. It calls to rise up, it calls for this site, and nothing else, a war of this with the rest of the internet.

These notes will come across bizar to some people who never read philosophy, this is not meant to be journalistic and all is directed to the main points, which are unlike most philosophy, concidering 200 years of testing Immanuel Kants philosophy, now established as a science, to state the exact opposite of what people are usually saying, and defend that it would complement the senses greatly to do exactly what people do not want you to do, and that not as a new revolution, as many on this premise have been introduced for the past 200 years, but to reverse them all and derive from it a 200 year solid shadow land of art and culture. We see the past 200 years art and architecture as our science, and the fragments of it assembled into one masterpiece, of which, a main theme is there, there is nota n art nouveau here, an art deco there, there is, tiniest shades of art deco here, and art nouveau there, and in that we see a 200 year evolution, the weakening of the arts that were there. The novelty makes it weaker, untill novelty becomes a purpose in its own right, as the term modernism implied. It could be an art in its own right, if not, novelty is at the side of quanitity, and against quality. Because as in recognition, it is the celebrity status now, recognition for novelty is long in the past.
These are philosophical short essays on very essential components and a new philosophy on modern life. Basis is that the sensory experience and artisan crafts as its icon man central mythology returns in every culture even one one the most distant planet we recently discovered and may inhabit some time, it is not as if a sculptor or a philosopher, or someone who makes a closet ever become outdated, you can not revolt indefinatly and not take with you the primordial lessons of life and artisan sensory experience, and see what the revolt had revolted about, what the revolt had lost, and what the revolt has as an alternative for what is lost, which means that, perhaps there was an alternative for the classic beauty, we will learn on all accounts there is not. But even more then saying there is no alternative for classic beauty, we can say, classic beauty is the treu revolt of a new age. Not, fitted in a classical museum, where it remains dead, but, as a concept now, as a manifest against the lack of a new language of form. A lost language, that revitalizes, intoxicates, as a medicine, it would fight our modern black and white with an ancient glorious color.
We do not deem this a new manifest of the senses, do not mistake us here, we like Rousseau, but we also like Voltaire, even more, since he won the argument, basically “i have gone without the ability to walk on my hands and feet for some time.” Even in todays World a marvelous lesson of a reprise on the subject matter. But basically they are both flawed, as much as William Blake, Rousseau, Alfred Kubin, Friedrich Nietszsche are within their subjective view point at the right side of the sensory and imaginitive defense Lines, opposing a clearly faultering positivism, a positivism leading to the blood letting of the blood circuit of the imagination itself and the prozaic and poetic in philosophy itself, which ailing is everywhere today apparant. Still they, these authors, do not in any way relate to the new arrival of the self, or a new realisation, out of, -as we could orient ourselves today- out of solipsism, back towards a Construction of knowledge from the nowhere where we are today, opposed to a discussion leading to the destruction of knowledge, and with that set free for a perversion of all possible scent of science and its methodical aproach to be dogmatic over, say, the language and the qualities of the World of the decadents or symbolists. If we live in a solipsist, scientific World, why would the World of the colors and achords and shapes and sounds of the symbolists and decadents be of lesser importantce, then science itself, yes, why, if at all science is treu, would it not triumph over it?!? We here describe First and foremost, as every philosopher of the past 200 years, as a part of the constellation of the senses, as a caleidoscope of fragments of the senses they each are, each describes a work of art in its own element, of which all form the Total artwork. If we can summarize this here and how this artwork looks, we have succeeded in making a manifest to have you reread all those artists and philosophers and construct a worthwhile revolution. Without this manifest however, we think it is impossible to read them and not pick up their mistakes or the debates against them and arrive at a World not even their worst enemies wanted to come about as we are clearly making that World come about today. Not to radicalize the society, the big simple machine, is a accurence hard to be done without this manifest, everyone is doing it today, not out of malign, no, we are malign by now, no, they do it out of knowing little better then persue a course, the industrial revolution and its individualization, each individual today even Marks only part of that growing and entangled machine, therefore we need a massive assault, and a grand revolving of philosophy.
The sensory trough history and its relation to technology and science and reason is mainly a theme of the past 200 years, or nothing else was at hand in the romantics, symbolists, decadents, as the impressionists, expressionists and conceptualists, be it the latter three only or mostly where it involved technical aspects, not having allegorical methods for thinking left, and in this, if we practically analyze what technology is, in the distance that can be overcome in the classic “time, space and causality,” or, gaining time within the production process, gaining over distances of the produce and resources for a specific location, and the causing, the handling and therefore gratification of the handling, altering or distancing from the locality, the bound to senses of the aesthetic concsideration and a consequent output of a lack of sensory bound materials, result is a product, result of the dogma of the product, and the gratification of the product, the quality and durability as quantity of the product. Technology streches the senses, we speak to people we can not see, we see only one frame of the entire scene, a camera viewpoint, we dislocate ourselves, we sacrifice a ritual of life to an array of technicalities, to develop only those, yes, to deem the classical life primitive and futile to our modern aqcuirements, but what have we aqcuired? Merely speaking sometimes to someone who we can not see?! We can safely say, to poetry, to wisdom, to aesthetics, to artists, nothing has changed, we are left with poisoned rivers, for a new color of paint on every car. But the car’s won’t change anything. They drive back and forth, but do they find greater arts in the distance? None. And arts is the texture of all of our World, Arts is the wall in which we are trapped, to describe all in art history is to desribe all that we life, if we realize that, nothing of what do today remains as it is today.
If we project this trough the entire process of industrialisation, we can also have some relativity in regards to technology, we are not against it, we simply say to awe upon it as its inventors would do, where it today constitutes a “mannerism” of technology, a lack of awe to the novel, is a culture tired of everything, but in incorporating into the novel the language of form, is the bind, the cream to bind the paint, with the cream, an entire wall gets painted.
That means, where the real breaktrough is seen, where a lively and thrilling notion of technology was, is now no more, the mere superficial themes still linger on, carefully hidden in commercial advertising, and why commercial advertising in the near future, will be deemed utterly corrupt. If the genocide today is ecology, then the advertising market is non less then the complete dogmatics of Adolf Hitlers Mein kampf, preaching from every possible angle in every possible light towards the “innocent” operators of the gass chambers, those operators of the gass chambers who then say. “somewhere beneath yes we are gassing entire oceans of fish. But who is to be responsible, really. The propaganda of stagnation, a depression of mankind, a genocide of beauty, upheld, for a charicature of capitalism, how deranged one who still see the First artisan advertising for artisan products and not see today as deranged in its own right.
This is why the very allegoric offenses, the “horrible and kitshy art” of the romantics can be concidered assault on modern age, not if their paintings are in musea, indeed they don’t work there, and they are kitshy, but on COMMERCIAL BILLBOARDS, they work on those, WITHOUT any description other then modern poets to summerize the needs and the errors of today. THEN there is a society again. And the commercial billboards indeed, in ALL the museums, THEN there is an awareness again, may curators have a lot of fun stacking them, its more befit to their job as scientists. Does it not appear all too clearly how that art deserves that, in the disaster that we have? In the catastrophe, only the romantic arts and how they were intended we see sand stacked before the flooding River.
The very nature of how shallow this all is today is little understood, one takes into account clothing of all historic times and today, one takes into account what people ate in the past and today. Then lots of other faculties of wisdom that made this age exist as philosophy embroildeled one theme on top of another, or an order of a few thoughts in general, and of which the philosophy is not known or understood anymore today. If the very worth of the ritual of past times is investigated, how a ritual can stir passions, where we now are bored. Then when all this is compared the shallowness of this age can be fought, maybe only the real melancholics do not speak much as yet, and sigh in treu tears and seen some misery, but that does not mean they would be ardent melancholics alone when they read this. One might get really angry. Or laugh in a way, hopeless as never concidered laughing hopelessly, this is a massive conspiracy of the undertones of passed philosophy. We are behaving as addicts, addicts to want a hit of cell Phone calling time. Eventually the ritual of life is lost, we need our fix, and as soon as we indulge to that extent, even poetry looks at us, and gives up on us, if we do not wonder.
The sentimentality of punks in our modern clothing does lie still with the classics, we just developed overall punk features. Whether there is, or ever was any substance to that, it was not the right time. But the very amusing idea is, if its not time now or soon, we will all be irradicated deu to our own, lack of… religion. A religion of the ideals, and surely, we lack no religion of lack of care now. We are zombified, blind drifting among decayed truths punks.
"Have you ever noticed how you had someone listen to something truly bombastic, or were around them and the music played, and the sucked the energy right out of it? Its like when you would have a black metal performence before a mainstream and you would stand there alone. There would be no energy?!" “It is like that the passionate drown below in heresy, while the sheep consume the world.”
All beauty is drained, let now on this unemployed and nothing of hope, grow an art, to strangle this poisonous society.













A Modest Proposal II
By Aeylyeaelle Ellhe De Ellendeh

The future is dead, this much in all exaltation of consumers and their present attitude is certain and can not be stopped. Therefore i suggest -modestly- that we prepare a chocolate factory with chocolate made from children, the chocolate factory will find itself preferably among an irish neighbourhood central Europe where the children can roam free and attend to their slave labour and finally be stuffing eachother into chocolate jars and heat them to a golden brown toffee color and texture of fine quality which can beat any Nutella or other ferrero produces. Hold off now before i scare all any who is allergic to chocolate, we will establish an entire chain of consumer articles, for which can be sacrificed as there is no more hope, will or sustainable future there, therefore children are the most useless, as their ideal and unspoilt wit and vigour could better attune a nice port of childrens blood, to be tasted on any kind of terrace in the spanish or french mountainsides and more appropriate for bourgois leasure, tropical swimming pools or otherwise entirely luxurious resorts surrounding Paris, a rare special mousse de viande or a paté, or perhaps a foie gras, or then skin used for the mature style lover or elderly richer consumers for their purses and car interiors can be appropriatly laced and furbished with their fine and smooth skin. We know this skin is very spacely hindered in its beauty by smoke stains or wear, scars or other inperfections which will be just a perfect neatness for any quality lover!! Their teeth could be used for light switches and will be in highest demand for the ones who were lucky to be mature at the end of time, it is hard and impossible to conceive of a better ideal!! We need not worry anymore, these children will have their fine time for our last hours and our last repose, as we sit sipping gently and have leasure now without having to watch them run around train stations which we barely want to do or play in playgrounds which always leads to awkward injuries. These kids were a neussence, as much as our interest or our care and sustaining a future is a terribly nuissence which we have now found the ultimate solution to rid of us both the children and their future both ends of this status quo which we can not possibly overcome or have any will power to overcome.



FIRST VERSE, THE APPEAL TO DOOM AND RUIN
(The interlocking and duty and inevatbility of idealism)
In order not to give you false hope, I will tell you what you are, and what its going to be.
Everything is subjective, and i am a subject, thats what everyone can say rightfully.
I went down the wrong path, and was myself, and tried ideals
I tried to ask a grain of rice and charge ten billion to build a girl a palace
But rightfully so she said she was disgusted
I tried to build a machine to save ecology and beauty and build new castles and start courts for aristocrats.
but no vampire, elf or angel is REAL????
THEY JUST COSPLAYERS
I said we'll build this and this and this, all castles, bridges in marble etc
and they said "yeah tourists will come"
I made a pagan artisan house, they said "yeah that would be a great bed and breakfast."
WE ARE ALL FUCKED CANT YOU SEE THAT?
I DID n't SEE IT?!!!
YOUR LANGUAGE YOUR RESPECT YOUR SMILES YOUR BACKGROUND???
So with all what you said "each to his own" "yeah there are aliens somewhere" "the aliens can zap here because the window is open" whereas i said "why do we sit inside when the window is open.
YOU ARE ALWAYS RIGHT????
So i will do my best, and get a job, i know what i'll do, i'll gather up the commercial advertising from letter boxes, and i will spread them in my street. Someone will pay me for that. But they don't even have to. They pay me to be insane so. If i spread these flyers then i do a regular job, contribute to consumption, let people do what they want.
I'll even vote for the national right wing cause that solves everything they say here. As the left solves everything too??!
And i'll see and wait the red carpet that everyone expects to be rolled out when we just serve our selfish needs.
I mean i came up with ideas and you said WE ARE ALREADY DOING THAT
Your such great politicians all of you and you convinced me.
I mean you said "WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO HELP YOU WITH"
And again nothing i was locked in and grew even more insane
I tried to restore the earth SEVEN times, SEVEN TIMES???
The definition of insanity is when you do the same thing over again and expect different results.
ITS TREU
IT WAS THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY
I DID IT SEVEN TIMES???
But the programmer is not going to make it, he wants to, but, no chance
Its all over.
I have dozens of other programmers
No can do.
So it ends.
I'll just shove commercial advertising in peoples letter boxes.
I mean they always said i should get a job. Because that contributes to society?!
And for beauty and perceptual and esthetics, the artisan gothic, vampirism, christianity, satanism?
Well fuck you too right?
I mean thats what we subjects now consider no?
Its all entertainment folks.
Its always "I'll catch up with you later, I got a relationship"
"Go do it, i'll join you when you get something done"
etc etc etc
DO IT SOMEWHERE?!
SOMEWHERE ELSE!
Don’t take me into your world?!
so its HOPELESS
Goodbye!
I'll be alone shoving commercial adds in the letter boxes like everyone else.
I hope we don't have to see much of anyone eachother or even write or speak or do whatever cause its all just hidious.
Politicians will find a way.
So I quit right?
I don't want to give you hope where there is NONE
You ALL took my Hope and shoved me in the dirt
So now i'll just shove everyone in the dirt like everyone else and there is no more hope.
Thats BETTER!!!

Or what i just considered, the prototype of hate in the past, of genius for mankind and its usual customs, is an absolute evil today, where you are constantly greeted by the uncurious and utterly unmannered and unintelligent, base and brasant in their stupifying arrogance.

I am a decadent, and a lover of excess beauty????
Sooo, naturally i feel most of the philosophy of decadentism and hyperestheticism of the late nineteenth century.
I admit that its a period where already "everything was done"
the emperors, the wars, this that. The artists sought within arts the beauty and the idealism of surpassed ages. Or rather corrupton and immorality, sadism and massochism, the excesses once more.
They detested civilization.
I think we were free in the nineteenth century. Look at Sade, De Goncourts. Masoch. We lost a lot since then.
...
But be that as it may.
WHo said i would n't want to be at a court?
Cellini working for the pope, being a jeweler at fifteen already.
Making the Sphinx in Egypt. Dreaming within that bubble of your imagination. What is the beyond?
Now we have to create such bubble against the dawn of nothingness. Always working against this nothingness. Why did they create it? I have found a way out of it, out of this dogma.
I consider the structure expands, space flight and space technology is natural to survive. Thats WHY it expands. Thats WHY everything is so useless, because we used too much space technology. We see the world as one country now. But we need to learn again from the imagination of past times, take it more seriously.
So we can't basically deny today the decadentism theories.
But with being a decadent. I would want to live in any classical age. I read of most of them.
Vita Romana i read about the life then.
Marie Antoinette i read about her.
I could have worked at the courts, crafting sculptures palaces.
But there is always something lacking in classical art that i find in THe Sphinx mysterieux by Van Der Stappen, or the Sleeping beauty By Sussmann Hellborn. Now those things are perfections. Not just you regular spats of clay, that is perfection. And i would always miss that philosophy of a beauty away from everything. A beauty of the treu ivory tower independant from Emperors, just to the artist alone, where he is his own authority!! And where he has seen and mastered any technique to utmost refinement.

A LAST NOTITION ON THE MASSES
It goes without saying and, untill i realized this just now i struggled with it but.
We are hypocrites supreme here.
What goes for the masses should n’t go for us.
And what goes for us should n’t go for the masses.
If one clearly IS NT part of the masses things get very confusing at this point.
But as a virtue of idealism no one is, so.
Since the masses say you should be part of them and a person to be found to agree with is hard to find.
If one is not part of the masses one is a paria. A morbid criminal??
Someone to be able to WRITE or to see THROUGH culture is now pushed in the depths and one is unable to find an intelligent person. If you had noticed that, welcome. If you were just living and not minding much, yes you are the masses.
Now fascism is hard not to embrace, let me clarify. "CHRIST" "HITLER" "CARS"
Those are the only three things the masses ever believed in.
They have NEVER Changed nor will they ever see the light.
That they now get a car commercial does n’t mean they don’t exist and have developed freedom suddenly.
Freedom to see the carcasses of dead arts yes.
"Freedom", "to get the artists from their clouds." As i actually hear people say in employment aid offices. Freedom to be pragmatic about their little subject life that you have to do this and that or you won't get by, that you need this and that or there will be hassle with authority and we have to conform and obey and file this paperwork here, there."
For me i have but for grave philosophical confusion and paralyzing melancholy, in knowledge of this manifest and its emanitions and death of society, for a grave coincidence i say, not killed someone, not attacked a shopping mall, not thrown all the bridges shut around this city and conquer it like the last thing on earth one is capable of doing.
I burnt or cut up or threw my passport away at least seven times.
But there is no life anymore without prophecy.
And there is no more prophecy without art, prophecies living matter, which must be restored, now with more rotten and solemn and deities who turn their head away from their flock, from sheep, and from babblers and debasment and degenerations.
We dispise this world of components, and we say it is by and for the masses, they regurgitate their own vomit, fine, if we would come with any other teaching we might save them from their misery. And create something catastrophic as you could only do with masses.
And there is no more art without beauty, their is nihilists corruptions of slaves as masters alike, bourgois were already crawlers and boot lickers, let them have their rot and decay.
And there is no more spirituality without beauty, where should you have a clear breath? Where should you have a beautiful tear? And you think those things do not exist then in your vulgar shit lands where you reign? And how many temples have you destroyed for your shit land now? You are wasting more of them with every playground for children who never grow up or an attitude in this life. Their minds like teeth burried in mountains of sugar with rivers of cocaine and nicotine running out of them.
And in that order and with that perception we set forth to a whole other course of society and idealism.
Completely different from what we had the past 200 years.
With the reversal of “fortune” of Immanuel Kant, in many ways the reversal of perception, of which we now know blinds the masses and the cultures, and did blind even the philosophers. Hahhh, one "who can not speak about beauty" must surely love masses?! Rather hate them? And now? Where is our wise men now? Lost? Unpublished? Left are the archeologists as the teachings run out!!
That a manifest should be written to initiate the SURVIVAL of the species before anything else.
That a manifest should be written on esthetic or material physical artistic beauty in a second stage.
That a manifest should be written hence on what the MASSES should do as their weight, which is a dumb weight, actually provides a sustainable future.
That this would rid of time space and causality is key.
That it would provide concrete and esthetic and physical solutions and at least appeals to all underneath to offer these and get things SORTED OUT is key.
That we have NO RESTRICTIONS is key.
Lastly, it would be that a morals for the masses, is only befit certain provocations. FINALLY we already know everything was said on that behalf, and we also know who said it.
So we can PROVOKE the masses.
They PROVOKE US?! We are, NOT commercial, we would be published with all the gold and respect by our kin? But from the masses we will get no respect or attention.
But at the very last it should not be a concern nor should anyone boost of the beauty of perversion confronted by something so adamently bad tempered and grim and docile in its capacity to comprehend any sensuality or deviation on beauty. It is entirely ones own bedroom, and people will not understand. Nor should we have any inclination to share our bedroom then with the maidens who’m it would concern the least bit.

The only philosophical problem is the masses, if we are our own messias, if Kant should have said we should each be our own Christ? What to do with them? I make myself no illusion that this will only strengthen those who are intelligent, or rescue them just in time before pending doom. Intelligence, a word that is presumed a troll worthy event any time you would mention it, of what hypocrisy should we or should n't we presumed to conspire, however in this world any sporadic notion of it would be lost. This recertifies genius and myth and intelligence, in a way that it would have been discarded and passed over today. Again we may resume our ancient craft of beauty; when you read this, it is its sole purpose to reaffirm ties with the ancient splendour, yes, live among them, and intertwine with them, rather then this mass and pleb culture which needs to conceptualize everything, put it in a glass box and stare at it. This time is in that so unlively, so much a boring archeologist of what life is in culture, that we need to seek refuge in art, as Schopenhauer considered. Very much walk into our own art. And robe that art then in the splendour of spirituality. Of serenity deified, never any loss more so then having a pejorative stance to the exaltation of arts spirit. A young loveresse in herself. Where we are afraid that splendour is the only thing of spirituality we will ever have. This book is written for the philosophical souls that are currently wrecked and torn, Wrecked not by rock formations on strands but by thousands of screams. Erasmus warned me of this hole of Trophonius of where he who returns can never laugh again. Stupidity, out of every mouth, every pore, every news bulletin, every advertisement. The notion of intelligence would at last make something as a key component as a patience, a stillness , the need to understand and elaborate, not just the vacuous rants and deliberations apart of the civil spilling sirop of indignation all over from their civil customs, to gratify a meagerness that they have left. But and in this also with considerations of the components of the avant garde acquisitions of the absurd, the surreal and the decadent, at long lest blossoming in our modern perverted hates and furious disgusts. How few are they who absorbed all this. Let it be known then, that it is among those of intelligence, who have absorbed Pessoa and Schopenhauer, Kubin, Kafka, Distopian authors and modernists, who saw where the course generally leads among the more significant intelligence, that the author of this manifest hit that dark wall too. And could n’t get out, words seemed to have no meaning. Only with these realisations of past purple and cream of verse could I rebuild meaning. It would then not be insignificant to offer it to other searching intelligence. Who will need that substance and intellect throughout their life, and not idle speculation, kitsh spirituality or conspiracies underground, or civil indignation on which most of the mainstream debate is based. We simply have to deal with matter, counsciouss, inspiration. Inspiration is truth I would have stated years ago. But it brings consequences fot this archeologic aproach in society and science, which we can not accept, science is merely a means, it is by no means an end purpose and a worthwhile faith, not at least where it does n’t place man (or female which i would suggest, the decorative) and art and inspiration central, it places a looking back prior to the exaltations of intuition, mixed with the marvels and wonders over those classical deities, here all classified regardlessly under mythology, even if i could have all called ir religion for that matter, and these now considered not before our time, but within this time, and before us to embolden and decorate, as they are the essential tool to live within spirituality, which is art, and for the rest, be cursed, your life, I can bring no solace, you are a worthless, walking zombie, and nothing of this will go into your eyes, for any longer then a flicker of a passing stranger, it will be swalloed like a spoon of oat meal, if that spoon of oat meal would come out of your ears just one second later.





Another Aphoristic introduction and series of brilliant starting positions for the fatal kill of a gutless and perfid society.

“Frail child, you are not ready to let go of the present, and with that will I know it is my sadistic pleasure, my vision the future, and my only fulfilment, the resentment of mass culture, to see you suffer more, when the present is taken from you violantly. Yes when this pleasent may, this solace to your heart, peace of mind, in which you vest your usual gibberish and your game shows quizzes and talkshows, and circle in a nice bubble car, and spout some wishywashy, very conserned considerations, almost indignated, ahhh, Should a doom be announced that became unbearable to you. Yes a Tyrants or Emperors Doom and Gloom upon inconspicuous dustgrains scattered in these decrepid storms as there would be, in change, something of a flood to wash over the present. It must be some wicked ingenuity. That you read decay here, and as you will read, you will see it all decay, stifle, and rot!!”

It goes without saying that this and the past is a very worthwhile, literate, considerate, educational, and otherwise completely unpopular topic. You would say what brings it then to trod on these parts? Well none other then build the pyramid in reverse, we welcome cosplayers, intelligent people and scholars of classical art and the surrealists etc everywhere underground, as black metal elitists etc, to cling into this and get through it. We fill the encyclopaedia here with classical art. And thus gain members. Then we drain the mainstream from anything valuable as it already has very little to offer. Eventually, all these publishers and pop and rap songs of who’m get around and eventually not get around no more will become the underground, and we will become its masters and dictate the world. WE who are, UNPOPULAR!! It is very natural that we regard regular people in the streets as aliens as they have no perception of a classical notion, and live the modern debate. They don’t really see us, we can debate them and they usually find it interesting, but other then that they will do nothing for us and establish no real connection as anything goes for them. This world or the next one, they are entirely indifferent to it. Three second minds and three second interests. Whereas we would say, this world is entirely desperate and hysterical, it IS eventually the mass main character, it recognizes itself in it. The classical and intelligent spirits have long taken back, and assumed another counsciouss then them. We who live in old rotten books!
It is inevitable that this paradox and this clash comes to a grotesque new reality.
As the masses follow the masses the energy gets sucked out of it.
As they always followed genius and new directions, i’m sorry but there is going to have to be that understanding, there are more prophets then are considered?! Would I Consider myself so lucky as to provide a teaching?! In this world? I but stumbled on a mealstrom, a paradox and a vortex, a web of mistakes and assumptions completely awry, and yes there is Foucault, why on earth would it be necessary to preach nothing or analysis? And if not that? What would we preach? Mayhem for some, Dark Opportunities to others.
So inevitably we have reponsability here, if we wanted it or not. We write and we have to write a new world?!
How on earth to do that with everyone stuck in the ONE opinion “owh but what you hold as an ideal will not be an ideal to everyone else.” SERIOUSLY that IS the only thought they have, a wise man always writes new material, but they repeat themselves over and over again, and they fail to see the masses always conspired in a few banal things. We have to actually solve a few things. This individual development was a philosophy that coursed, shone like a lightning or a comet, over a stable ground, for the shortest amount of time, a lot of fun and games and stacks of advertisement in the mail came of it, owh let us indeed suffice the masses, it need n't take much space technology and sacrifice of good art. Be it in romantic or early industrial age. But it was decidedly a dead end starting at the death of society and civilisation already in the 40's, and what of aristocratization??
How can we get out of the fact that we are just subjects? That we can say or do what we want but we can just build cages and say nothing about beauty? Or composition?! How will we restore the oceans then??
HOW will we SURVIVE??
We are just bactaria growing if we can’t speak on beauty art or composition, and we are just taking over and expanding then untill we are dead.
But BY MEANS of that subjective opinion. No one said there could n’t be something else to believe. Now then we argue, we orient ourselves to the preraphaelites and reverse schopenhauer and reverse hegel and all those philosophers and see there is A LOT of religion today and the wise said A LOT to get to this religion so what on earth should we then do? Consider it done? Consider it all over? Apparently when it is a religion something is wrong with it, and the chapels of nothing and machines who vomit faecal matter and latex dolls with their head up their backside and other delicious art is surely no Bernini. And why not then?? Something here stinks. IF all the wise would have concentrated on beauty, and stuck to describing everything we consider beautiful it would n’t have gone so deranged, then beauty would n’t have been SUBJECTIVE, we would have ANY word left. Since mainly if everything is subjective you just destroy words, at no point are you stating anything significent when you destroy words, vent and rant indifferently of any principle, or drag the whole world and indeed its BEAUTY with it down into a drain of bacterial growing once again and that be the end of it. We need to recapitulate from the beginning and realize TIME does not exist. SO any museum or scientific value is perception and a construction of ritual and new rituals and by definition To gaze back and respect genius as an artefact, is FALSE within any conceivable reality. We do not respect past genius? We respect ourselves as we ARE them. DREAM AND IMAGINATION, not verity but SENSUALIZATION, the sensual of deity or angels, can absolutely be TREU, at no point should we falter, at no point should any excuse for art be considered an excuse but highest faith and possibility to exaltation and woe and melancholy, passion and fury resulting in a few hundred stabbings in the breast of the wretched hag of nihilism. If it does not create art, move on, find another word. It created paganism and there were cultures, GOOD, it created God and there were cultures, GOOD, it created various directions of classical cultures, GOOD, lets expand on halloween then!!
Therefore we can say we have gutted all the classical cultures and the churches for nothing.
We have created a belief in cars and consumption and industry for nothing.
Is a church only usefull for a cell phone mast? A Cell Phone Mast is only usefull because i had once seen a church, and know you have done it again. 50 percent of matter of medieval and classical culture was religion, so was 50 percent of adolf Hitler, so is 50 percent of modern culture.
And they ran off with it.
And now any consideration is of course, “unpopular.”
But that all evaporates when you conceive.
A
The structure is expanding and this is not the moment to get a vacation.
B
We are all free now dancing on the carcass of life.
C
This can not last.
D
What follows is, society is bound to collaps WHEN this is understood and ONLY when this is understood.
You can effectually NOT get out without this.
There will just be a cacophany and grand lunch eating the earth with the debilitated, the average, the babblers, the babblers without any intelligence, would have a final lunch, years, a decade at most, how can it create beauty out of nothingness? Would n't that call for a bit of magick then? And who here can blow this society so far off its ledge. That it finally caves into its detrimental and sickly triviality.

If desire has left you to believe in something, may it be beauty, and that desire will laugh last, even later then science, as it is life, and the composition made out of desire, is rather the opposite of the defaitism and the lack of dream and imagination of science.
WHen all is known and explained, you will still have billions of years of dream left. And when shall you give up strangling the arts?
But this age is stuck in a paradox, it criticizes modern art and says why is n't there classical art because that is the only language it has?!
To worship beauty and be stuck with the dissapointing stuck up idiot inside of it indifferently shaking her ass in all directions or plucking all of your feathers, is the final verdict, it is, again, life. But we are stuck with art, and hence metaphysics, what is a philosophy of the deplorable of life, is in itself the counter metaphysics, a counter metaphysics will suck the life out of everything. So we believe in metaphysics, in the concepts of words carried by life, in that thing of beauty, in art and composition, which we must hold as a manifest to and if we want to finally preserve the earth, and grow from nothing out of Mars, therefore it can not be “subjective”. The era of subjectivity is over.
We need to grow a culture from nothing.
And here earth has ended in the culture OF nothingness.
We CAN deduce from that that the beauty of woman exists, beauty of trees, nature, mountains, molds, spiders, insects, the skin of reality exists. Silky smooth as woman, or woman reminding us of the purity of northern ice and ancient rivers, and the kindness we may receive from sober wants if we asked nature something, dew and skimmed milk, and that the intelligence of it is under debate, we can certainly consider some woman intelligent, as much as some men are intelligent some woman are wacked, some men are wacked, but we have popularity and nihilism against us. We need to delve a long way back, and that culture today is n't quite there. We need to include so much, gems in the sewers, how shall we write, what shall we write, the unpleased, grumpy, hatefull audience.
Other then that we consider this myserious intelligence a “nuanciation” or to be lost in perpetual nuanciations (much like this author and this manifest) one is incapable to portray the irrelevance of grammar and spelling substrate and not supremacy over insight. That comes from inspiration, newer dreams.
But the masses are perpetually trapped to believe and to cling to a hallicunogenic meagerness of the past. Left are but family pods, breeding pods. Stacked all over, cheap and filled with garbage.
And now, this all sardonic, malevolent idea, that this manifest is, comes at the time of the “new” when the masses are held before ultimate choices, and where their dispickable nature, and most peoples powerlessness will be reversed against their own kind.
And where the prowess and resiliance, and superiority of intelligence, does not tolerate simple babble and politics and ape supremacy anymore. Not the basic vain lies and concoctions of rabbid bitchings and other goings on.

When a deity is not universal for sure the key to the imagination which makes it spiritual and for it to instill awe, is the quality of the imagination which is serenity. And that for sure opposed to hysteria and superficiality is universal. I object to the fact that when everything is subjective there is nothing. Believe in nothing is to create nothing. As many have done. We need to undo this now. With all the exact science now since the enlightenment We did n't learn anything. Yes the imagination is part of dialectics and yes now we need a synthesis of that imagination, to escape the constraints of the modern world
We are not saying religions can not be real but with the problem of the object to a subject we discarded and made the imagination horrific to the civil in the romantic era; which has its advantages and disadvantages. Beauty became virtual, the artisan was lost, then again it resulted in a world without power or center. A thing we need to reestablish now all on our own.
Atheism and religion versus imagination that is but a distinction our modern language would like to make, in an organic natural reality imagination art and spirituality are one, there is enough double meaning and mystery of perception to work on the majesty of classical art, without it we are like a plucked bird
But as you can't decide for someone else what truth is imagination is universal and serenity the value of divinity yes, opposed to ironic imagination you could say, opposed to the peasentry pragmatics of most people, -who have that pragmatic peasent still in them by any means clearly, and who’s notion of scoffing something is like flushing a toilet. They do not have a legacy, thus they do not have a responsability, the majority of the three second mind spews indifferent or momentarily popular moral nonsense.
It doesn't have to be Just a story as two hundred years of that brought us today to the end of art, modernism surely is n't a Bernini, so it has a philosophy, it makes a concept of nothing out of what should be prophecy, therefore it is a paradox, and plainly, wrong.
Words can merely establish or plan and plot the esthetics of this world and represent deities in allegory. To look for spirituality and not be a warrior for the artisan would then also be a paradox. But here we do state that art and therefore fetishism is widely important.



If everything is subjective we would forget one thing.
That air, color, flesh, perception exists, that the here and now exists, leaching into other here and nows. I can not offer a good criticism other then the allegories i will propose here to see how it created a monster. And how anyone would have to speak of regression.
The miserable will go "everything is JUST subjective", indulging you into it, the masses will go "everything is subjective", beat and deaden anything with it, meanwhile all the rock stars and pop stars said "you be you" great then, as that is clearly working out. And the Nietzscheans will go everything is MY SUBJECTIVITY, and the rest is nihil. What that subjectivity would be, i have n't heard them state much allegories. Can anyone elaborate on something profound please?
Is there no way out?
Something we can agree on?
It has come then?
Can you find the other intelligence and get them to one point?
And let them tell you how to get this stack of shit sorted?
I’m sure Buddha sit there like candy on a stick is not going to solve it now.
I’m sure Christ turn the other cheek is not going to solve it now.
I’m sure Kant everything is subjective will not solve it now.
I'm sure Marx lets provide the masses with all the goods they may want will not solve it now.
I'm sure Less is a lot more these days, so much more in fact, that i'm sure there is not much more less to add to it!!



“Spirituality is what makes us as adults and makes of normal people children, and we lost that.”
Life is about MAKING LIFE! FIGHTING the deplorable component civilization we are in. GRAB A SWORD! If you have none soon, the judgement will come with it, it was part of one of the only consumer goods you needed. Then they smile? Owh my, don't bring it here don't bring it there and if you bring it we smirk, our modern time such leasure and amuse, we don't need swords, we have jokes now. I'm afraid, irony is more ironic then you thought.
Its not about this end game absolute "ahh everything is shit" THATS NOT what it is.
Spirituality is what makes us as adults children and we lost that.
To REaqcuire spirituality in a profound way. To have it seazed once more from the awareness of nihilism around.
For that one needs to BE BOLD but it exists in the ARTS and with ARTS and the EROTIC as medium.
It is female and vain, ungratefull. But we are soldiers fighting nihilism. 
And aqcuire bejeweled dances for our moments we live.
As we look back. And forget the worlds hysteria and positivism.
Positivism is the end, this end, the parasite on the past.
Life constreus, resumes, EVEN the "new" had to decay.
And we sunk deep depths.
But from that the sail of artisan beauty is refreshed and a blessing.
Like an old worn relations and we grow old.
Now a fresh allegory offers herself as virginity herself, and we, corrupt and hungry for this majestic sin rejuvinate! Virgins classical adore, and to some twisted generals emperors and kings alike they struck as deer. But mankind today, even christians compare girls to tooth brushes. Well. Get along with the advertisement. We shall have no part in this time, how should we possibly answer you?
Spirituality is BOLDNESS and YOUTH, to worship the bold and the youth.
And under all things is nihilism, and above all things is imagination and splendour of representation.
We FIGHT for temples now, and movie cathedrals.
THings outside and BEYOND commerce
That is our battle.
That life is meaningless, is merely the capital for a meaningless society.
Christ is indeed an example.
As He GAVE meaning.
Modernists are shit, as they preached shit.
And now we have to get out of this vicious loop.
And we now can say.
WE ARE ALL aristocrats.
WE ARE ALL Christs.
And nothing less!!
And who is not.
If he is not mediocre.
Then he better get with the program or be abandoned in this modernism and its posts that is passed us!
It was always there is LESS there is NOTHING.
But we never lost anything, art as the physical manifestation of beauty and all constructs of life are never lost in culture, there can only ever be more.

“I”m overwhelmed by a sickness for no one but debilitated ironies to lack recognition of ligitimate greavences, and the world is so full of debilitated ironies, that it will take armies without opinion to lash it down, and to continue existence of an all degenerated all devouring pleb, who wants nothing but solidify its sympathy with everyone ordinary, that they should work, have a family life, and spin a bureacracy so vast it would sink any ship they would set sail on for every deviation of that concept.”

“There is not enough of us. We better retreat. It IS sad people just don't get "modernism" as in understanding the novel text of romantics and symbolists.
And then all those atheists, positivists, subjectivist zombies and tourists that came out of the "modernist" awareness.
Or out of the romantic and symbolist movements.
All the Penis talk people that came out of surrealist avant garde.
All the civil tidy house with garden tree and two point four children that came out of the positivist ideal.
All the civil devotions and virtue talk that came out of the average "family central to composition" doctrine.

We regard the world today as a disease, it is terribly undistinguished and prejudiced in its ability to understand the difference between a “craft” which is something of passion and truth, and something “fun” or a hobby” with it comes the disease of modernism towards religion and spirituality. Immanuel Kant basically delivered us all to advertising and garbage. “quality” another word you will not hear as products have quality but no culture, or no quality but are supposed to be culture. As it is we have a plethora of artists who are alerted by job offices and social care they “will have to be taken off of their little cloud” this while supermarkets or even movie theaters of who’m are modern markets (supermarket notice how it takes into their age) and cathedrals (movie theaters are but the imagination, and imagination serene or otherwise decadent is ethics, so hence religious.) have not the slighest considerate decorative architecture. This while modern architects can not break this deficit and consider “we don’t know any better then to stick forms back on” Michel Foucault, as we will mention here regularly, already considered regression as the modern disregard for consideration ends up in its own demise and the death of inspiration, and again as we will refer here to modern artists. There exists something as a “Chapel of Nothing” and a “man with his head up its own ass” or a “Fat David” etc etc, its all not individualistic but in the same vain and very much the death of itself. Of course the answers to that are none to be found or understood. “Build that...", they tell me when i envision an esthetic concept, "...and the tourists will come” or “that would be a great bed and breakfast”, this vocabulary is just breathtaking, frustrating, disgustinG; Any craft is a “hobby” because you need a “real” job. Its always “something you enjoy doing” and “that can’t be real.”
Therefore we do not consider subjectivity was managed , achieved, by the very notion of subjectivity. Through Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, the dadaists the conceptualists and the Bauhaus and so many others the intelligence basically created a nihilism and disdain of matter and esthetics.
NOTITION, in the following article and aphoristic treatize we will use the word “sheeple” this is a very dangerous term as everyone already knows who that is. And they are the majority, and everyone knows it. Now you can’t say that, because its not, advertizing friendly. Its not even democratic, its supremely subversive as it would undermine the very notion of democracy and the whole lording over the world of this majority and the "democratization" of media wherein more is lost then gained, as a matter of fact it becomes a mish mash of ranting and despair. It would n’t match the ideal of a whole world bettering itself spontanuously through everyones subjective intelligence. But there are a few things wrong with that concept of subjective intelligence. First of all why is the world so diar if everyone was doing their best? Secondly why did everyone stand there before Hitler? And only a few protested? How to make a “democracy” out of that, if that word or concept is at all possible considering Christ and churches were the main theme of it in the past. And before that it had ever other themes, not one included the masses, and certainly, not this culture either. This is what we will imply with the cultural leaders who defined the present nihilism, but before you get frightened of someone using the word “sheeple” let me also at the back then describe who exactly they are; and then you will not hesitate to recognize them. You can not really deny the meaning of that term once we have defined what danger they pose. And as you could understand, the open society will set open the flood gates of offices and popular debates to these sheeple as never before. There is no supression of the sheeple here, no democratic, marxist, or capitalist, nor most democratic present day institutions could be considered supressing the sheeple as they are, first of all, endowed with them at the peak posts, they are secondly, providing eachother with all the worlds goods as if there is no tomorrow. THAT IS the problem?? “Each to his own” “don’t change the world change yourself” IS the problem?! This is a culture apart of distopian authors. This is a religion apart of Wittgenstein and others. This is a part where heroes in fiction are revered, as fiction, whereas in classical serenity they would be revered as deities. But these psychologies today are easily analysed and with further scrutiny utterly debased and undecorative as unsustainable. The entire thread of modern thought is unsustainable.
We consider here a few necessary and utterly adament principles of idealism and esthetics in their most essential and rudimentary form, as artists produce today mostly irony and criticism, this can not be maintained, perpetual irony could be usefull when there is limited degree of power and armies should be ridiculed, the concepts of the dadaists and conceptualists themselves are redundant now.
If we reached peak individualism, then a despair and a nonsensical series of leaders spouting inumbicuous nonsense is standing still.
We need to create the world and have all encompassing power, hence futile wisdom as old as “change yourself before you want to change the world” leads to a world of smug tourism and subject "i don’t care much cause its not my responsability." This together leads to the devestation of the entire earth. We then deem it natural and proper, that the individual soldiers of the US Russia and China military take a look at where they stand and how the chess pieces are put? It does n’t take a lot TO understand, anyone can. Therefore the armies must cooperate to secure the planet with the police, and take it away from the sheeple who are protected by the police from the rabble, the rabble nor the sheeple interest us, merely the necessary steps for survival. We deem the mass dictators and leaders have always HUNG and disgusted idealists, they have put them in cages, and are now drugging them. So we deem it not unbefit the artists will simply now call the shots. Maybe they can put the dictators and masses in concentration camps, if they would get some bread and water and work well. We would still survive, by any definition this is still better then their own world?? Which is total devestation, extinction, rotting all poisoning oceans and cannibalism to the end of the species.
Each subject therefore, can be free, no subject should be a tyrant and should not be obeyed if it goes against the interests of survival. There needs to be a few criteria then. A soldier should stand up and fight when woods are burnt or fish are not managed well. This is a total change in the concept of war. No longer are resources part of national or regional bounderies, they are effectively taken away by the growing sheeple and their childish perception of property, of which politics is the main derivative and perpetual hassle.
We will state here that the structure is expanding, nowhere can this be stopped but by a composition of the sheeple which is long overdue.
We know form first hand and can talk about sheeple who
babble (about the weather, hotels, their childrens pleasures and sheeps pleasures and dismays)
-don’t speak clear language but repeat everything is relative or subjective or any form thereof as stated by former wise men
-just do their job and hold no other authority credible.
The sheeple are the ultimate species, they are massive in size and every politician and every media is trying to get their attention, this is ultimately self destructive clearly.

If no educator is allowed amongst the sheeple then this world will end within a matter of years.
There ar e kids games today who state the most blatant idealist nonsense, stand up for noble causes, and its considered fiction, if they grow up its considered fascism likely.
But as soon as you hear someone talk as such to a soldier or a polician or a youth, “we must save this planet from extinction” it is instantly vulgarized by trolls and others who are apart of the sheeple control organism and works as such as a n spontanuous CIA against any worthwhile cause or a confirmed significant problem on the way forward.
We deem most people have taken to a logical phalacy that we may call an absolution. It is not related to the christian concept, people say “all is useless” which would apply very much and again on the one saying it. If we on the contrary establish creation and language itself is decorative this makes no sense, you simply exclude the decorative facet of language, and attach “uselessness” to “all” This is a personal choice to do so, it does n’t have to be our choice, especially not if we sit idle and waste time mostly occupying ourselves in our own world. Then comes the question, if life is decorative why would n’t our own world matter. Ahhahh but if it does matter your heaven as a sealing should matter, not just the roof over your head. It does in fact matter, yet all are deluded into thinking their roof will hold, when all are convinced mostly that the roof of the heavens is about to collapse.
Then they have bubble realities in which all kinds of hysterical desperate or trivial entertainment or advertising spouts out from the same masses, who we consider, “regurgitate their own stupidity” if at all someone would say the oceans are dying and rotting, and spout that in the ether, of course there would be a lot of screaming, as much as a sober conception of it and overlooking it all, anyone who does that is held at the bottom.
If you demand militancy and not just a strike but sheer stand in the streets with a sword, then you can not be understood. So in fact we have an ENTIRE empty palace, ENTIRELY devoid and defunct. That would be an absolution if not people are sometimes capable to do something for eachother, sometimes, so the world as it is can not be completely dead. Even if usually they will, as Kant claims, rely on the mutual benificiality of comeradry or self preservantion, or a love to be gotten from it, however again this would be an absolution. Therefore the spiritual nature and that of a person is demarkating the worth of kindness, or beauty , in a limited field, this would apply to the kitsh color of who’m now is scoffed or otherwise within the kitsh movement developing to the delusional. Astrology, aliens, lizzard people, etc, spirituality is an art concept, it can be certified as that, a thing that inspires, as it IS raw inspiration. We can affirm it and indulge in it, yet if it deludes us from the main spirit of a practicality, a practical survival, an effort to commonly strive or strive for common goals so simple as the preservation of ENOUGH resources for all, then that would be considered a delusion. If you had walked in a modern city with a viking axe to combat this world, and not even managed to kill someone, then this can not be considered a delusion. This is raw reality of a realist. TO take out some people would have long guaranteed my wisdom to get more credit being spouted against society from a prison cell. By all means I failed, my easy claim to fame, as everyone will currently even deny me this fame would actually exist for me, in that event being realized. THAT much blatant denial is there, that this is ALL people care about, and i could have easily just called intelligent people, and at least have known if someone on this planet is still alive??! Now i must roam without media or kin, lost among the sheeple and the rabble, that gave up kings, that gave up courts, that gave up on knowing where they came from, and who their wise and prophets were, the wise and prophets have completely fallen through the net of this era, all the little sprots and sardines now, what is left is the whales of stupid.
Now that we mentioned the sheeple we also mention the artists.
What are artists?
-talk about ideas
-talk about ideaLs
-talk about philosophy
-come up with unsettling truths
you can see how society would want to keep them under water, all that is effectively considered are criticisicm or modernism part of the establishment. As a “subject” you of course can critize the lack of worth of the society. You can not however propose the unsettling idea of changing it. Therefore criticism is not at all positive subjectity?? It is merely being a coghweel in an ever narrower reality. Where actual ideas are scoffed in preference over the vast nothingness of modern society.
We even go beyond that. In every instance the soldier that is prepared to die to fight for what he protects is superior to the bloated notions of individuals who are considered to be allowed to consume even if it needs to be the end of the world . The first has no permission for an opinion, he just needs to listen, the second has all and any entitlement to an opinion, even if it is the most degenerated one one can think of. We need soldiers and general and leaders who rise above nations whims and interests, who seek to own what they create, and create regardless of nation or money. Create rather dream then reality. Create rather the incredulous then the pragmatic. In that people want to live, in reality, it is unbearable to live. We have it now. But as soon as you read this, its already changing. Because there is and will never be a point to it, if money transfers from one end to the other and no world is left, then all there is to gain is decorative art, and thats all the purpose. In other worlds, most of this world created to great cost, can be broken down again and done anew.
Military law would indicate someont to protect his own, that to protect ones own currently means annihiliation of all means military law should be under serious scruiny and all passed knowledge in that field must be left to the history books. You would want to protect all before you protect that of yourself. Natural. Equally the buddhist and laissez faire philosophy is corrupt as humans are a commodity and have the responsability to create and manage environments not just parasite on them.

In short, Immanuel Kant had to lead to a society of the mediocre, therefore we reject it. Everything has to be under scrutiny of critical analysis now, so that only ironic nihilism is left. Why not put that under a critical analysis and resume LIFE? They made a psychiatric disease out of Diogenes and called Byron Bipolar, but a language for art or beauty they have n’t got that no more.


“By all means people are resentfull. If you tell them to “develop themselves” they will not, but repeat that. “Everyone must develop themselves” If you call that then a paradox they will call that short sighted. How is that not resentfull? Therefore the only leadership befit this world, is an emperor who knows he is alone, who does what is necessary for it to survive, only in the eyes of artists and craftsman, but who sits on a throne ruling the blind and the numb, as poets are only understood by themselves or other poets. Mankind is blind. If you show it light, it will look at your finger pointing to it. It will look at you and keep asking it, why do you reside in that darkness. Well. Because, that light is just for you. I will not cherish it.”
“And by all means that in itself, that fact, is not just a mistake, a stupidity of the masses, many brilliant minds fell for that notion. They all developed it? For 200 years?? And so this dialectics is none the less an empty box. “ “The Emperor with no clothes” is now the democracy with no clothes. Everyone can see the great debate and everyone gets equally discouraged by the plethora of modern trivial opinions, of who’m are left or right and not the least bit classic, which would sort of, mitigate, have some salt and some grains in the composition, give it substance, but alas, what are classical rhetoratical books good for? No one can understand them, its not good marketing, its just not popular, hey, get hysterical, you’ll get attention. It will all be better then. So often the best lessons in marketing are the ways to lead your lyrics to vomit on people more despair, meaninglessness and hysteria, to give an easy snack, as we can see when advertising actually works, trivialize all possible affects and endearments, and make the trivial product something of an indispensable and absolute awe over a trivial thing as nature and a deity; then this society is what we call reality and all our notion of reality today should be based on that. Well how on earth did Pessoa and TS Eliot consider to solve that? Or revolt to that? How were they to slay that parasite? With nothingness? With saying its just a wasteland? Write a new distopia? We need ACTION not authors. This is a manifest to understand ACTION as i already stood there bashing with viking axes and swords, the police has 1 viking axe and four swords? WHEN WILL YOU ALSO SEE THEM MORE PAGAN ARMS???

“I think, the world is no leasure palace today, that is the religion, to me its a battlefield, i'm not enjoying the scenery, I'm fighting with my last dying breath. Stuck behind enemy lines, where everyone wants to do it for themselves. Where they are left without a language.”

When you have said everything is subjective and it developed into “develop yourself find your own meaning.” You might find you made the mistake that most people think the world around them simply does n’t exist. Its not very open minded to teach people that at all. How many people have swallowed the world? That want to make small steps to spit it back out? How many people stop caring because so many people stopped caring? A never ending despair where no one has responsability, everyone has a small part to play. So everyone gives up. The responsability is to dreamers and lunatics now. Owh you need to be drugged, you need to be protected from society, you don’t like us. Really society needs to be protected from me, they know well, their empire, this structure is coming to fall. And where I am ready to bash the pigs skull. And eat the pig. And leave for the artists a fair share, and leave for the zombie indivuals the scraps.

“The prophet that said that each developes his own opinion, has nothing to say, and has everyone repeat after him still. And then when I read the romantics, they indeed have their own opinion, full of prophecies on beauty. And then when I see this, I indeed would n’t figure your culture is degenerate, if i would consider all was individual development. Those are blinds.”
“Everything in this day and age so soaked in what has no use, that when you do have something that has a use, something kind or beautiful or precious, you seem to have to crawl into the ground of shame for it.”

“I woke up, and it was dark, but i realized I dreamed and I saw something, so I realized in a dream you make your own light.”

“All reality you could possibly understand comes from a book, so all reality is fiction.”

Below we have the notion of kitsh as it pertains to modernism, modernism considers allegories and esthetics as kitsh, by all means that is how it evolved, we use it here to emancipate it, and to analyze how nature and life has essentialy become kitsh deu to modern ergonomics, a ritual of life is all now kitsh. It is the only way to perceive and emancipate as find actual words for what people will regardlessly laugh away as “we live in a modern world now” and “thats been done” and “everyone has their own opinion (about beauty)” these things are laughable and surprisingly the only answer to how extreme a dogma that is becoming is not their answer, which they will say at the other end that life is meaningless. A religion in its own, but it is exactly that, kitsh, in all splendour of any quality of the artisan, not simply a refuge from this world, but a solid mechanics of faith, spirituality, and conviction, would one not flee from it this kitsh, or need it to be relative, or when one is swallowed by all relative causes to let this world go away and not care anymore?
The cloaca machine and so many other modern art wants to pose the objection that this society is lost, when you offer them something classic however they don't understand it.
However i should agree, simply offering them something classic DOES n't actually make sense, i need this theory. Even if it is not easy with this. "Nothingness temptation." How on earth to fight that with a meaning? "Find your own meaning" or "look for meaning" is n't exactly a meaning. Again, paradoxes to create this world.
Again, Nueschwanstein is considered kitsh, fantasy faerytale villages for children are considered kitsh, everything minimal and conceptual is considered reality, “the reality in which artists must come from their clouds”, milking a cow with your hands, everything of such nature can be considered kitsh, the artisan, is considered a hobby. A real job, is considered reality. But all this conceptual reality is in its turn a form of kitsh if you don’t integrate it with twohundred years of insight. Thus our system allows us to step outside the narrow and ever narrowing abyss of modernism, and integrate and use at will systems of thought and composition alike, we validate things we do no longer scrutizine what is in fact a reality. A hard matter, in which we have found in the course of modernist philosophy only despair, we read things backwards too. As what is developed from the theories is the least desirable. Of beauty we can not speak. Well here is a word that we can apply and what we have ground for, beauty which is kitsh as far as it is rooted in the artisan. Needs to be integrated exactly to suffice the soul, to have an ecology central to mankind.
Thus we have another protest to the modern dogmatics. We now have virgin milk a cow as an artisan protest, we now have everything artisan conceptualized as it were. And this would not be unlike a new dialectics.
The fractal of artisan within space technology.
We can not deny that modernism is a consensus, an era, it has nothing to do with individualism. All the features of its philosophy and decorative ideals are quite above the individual, as much as in Baroque or medieval one was also an individual, i mean under a universal dogma and a philosophy one can always be an individual. This is not where the problem lies, it is as soon as you bring up the general philosophy people will argue its about individualism. Which is a flagrant lie, and of which people who know philosophy and literature and art history are well aware. And which people, again, we mean to find. As they are rare and probably alike myself not living in this age anymore, we are of another age, we combine these past 200 years, and yes, as far as being spectators of the decadence of the past we are of decadent conviction. What else is there for us to do? But these systems, to build out of dream. The system of art for art must be developed into art as meaning itself as Schopenhauer said. Of which this is the protest against the diminishing of that meaning. A system to arm yourself against the nihilism and despair of emptyness and these chapels of lonelinss and machines of shit they are making everywhere. The head down ones anal oraphus, that indeed is all art. But it comes from the subject, and the subject is within the time. TO propose ideals of beauty then? Each of these artists to criticize time would wave them away. They say no we are modern now. But all their arts point to a crisis? A criticism? Which they are not capable to embrace the solution of?? Well then if YOU offer or are apart of this modern society then WHERE are the individuals??? Well where are the others? Where is the populace that is always mentioned in the papers as to dissaprove more garbage in this world? Lets form a frontline then. With these cosplayers and black metal and farmers who have in this world not the least bit of credit, everything this world does n’t care about?! In its futile minimalist towers?!
19th century romanticism gave us this world, i say we need to read them backwards. And we also need to devise some kind of revolution, a transcript of beauty and spirituality in material form, within art. Modern people are really not going to read any spiritual text and go, owh yes lets change it all. Well it needs to be something else so. I'm trying to find that way. trying to capture what is wrong here; It can only be material since political is ending in a huge debate where nothing flourishes, it needs to be in the domain of the arts. So just saying arts and crafts is either a hobby or throw it away as elitism is futile. I'm certainly considering it is elitist as modern people have what they want. I consider just the fact that the masses have no real potential to survive or live on their own considering i propose Kant is not a philosopher but a prophet. We need to capture all time and artisan beauty and pronounce it again. Have no affinity anymore with nor religion nor dogmatism nor the philosophy of religion. Merely the poetry of it and the art of it. Thats what i advocate. As basically when Kant stated we don't know what is behind the subject, basically he should have said each person can determine his spiritual sense with poetry, and indeed communicates on that. He said we can't communicate on the object which led to the industrialization and structure that we have today. WHere philosophers like Wittgenstein etc said "what we can not speak of." It just got worse in general. if you have a big perspective surely it all collapses???? And then what is left of individuals? Made into individuals because there was no communication? No Beauty? No Arts? No Artisan? No quality. THAT is you individual, you who have nothing!!
"How all reality comes from dream, fiction, and from prophets, any reality comes from a Prophet, be it powerless realities, empty realities, dead realities, as beautiful realities. "

The functional is bollocks and hogwash, first of all by definition nothing in existence can be related to further function and is therefore decorative. Anything as will be considered later also, can be relative and automized, industrialized, reproduced, we can create empty theaters with movies made by robots and computers with robots sitting there watching the movies and thinking about it and going out and drink tea and talk with other robots etc. WHAT is functional then? Modern furniture and design gnaws away at beauty. Something is defended as innovative because of some technologic or some gimmick, it is not innovative when it is beautiful, thats exactly WHY they call it innovative. Reason does n’t find that as an absolute quality at all. Then again unfunctional things in that sense would exist by ecstatic circumstances outside any definition, a perfect if not one of the most beautiful flowers standing remote untouched by a bee, not very hard to imagine it here and there exists. let alone nuns in monestaries for that matter. Well too as that flower petals are not functional but decorative, and a bee is laced in that in a luxury and embrace , or would it not be possible to have thought of all flowers without petals or shapes? That would be functional truly. We admire a bee to fall asleep in a flower, they irony and gentle within the natural world excites us. We constantly want to wonder. Well wonder, nothing about it is eventually functional, as it has no meaning, nor can it be derived to any conslusive explanation. Its just rivers leading to oceans, water vapourising, and a final looping of reason.

The trauma of collective stupidity of mankind is the liberty to the artist, in which he realizes his flight, he finds in it a new freedom, and the resiliance to the leader, -in which he realizes his glory, he finds a new empire.

So, The subject and the object, the subject communicates, Kant alleviated this to the essence of the being of metaphysics, considering it a feat of communication. But then basically now minimalism would be metaphysics would n't it? The ding and sich, a white wall, and most subjects left empty. Hence how these myths of zombies develop.

Its the talk of the town, how everyone finds something else beautiful, no one every talks about what is beautiful anymore, the communication has shifted from “what is”, to what everyone “finds not”, thats the problem with individualism , as automatically when you give people individualism it will create generality. Therefore a certain debate about what is and limited scope must be offered here then this “all has their own opinion” as that is not actually an opinion. Do rephrain from saying “but you can’t have an opinion as everyone has his own.” which is what I often get these days.
But as you offer an opinion, you also get to have an opinion about that. If you say each has his own, usually your not very permissive of one. Its a new fundamentalism, which drives people totally insane. NAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH you can’t have that opinion each has his own?!
And somehow thinking people are stuck among these decapitated slobs. Frail and reflective beings, full of wonderous stories, and they need to be vomitted on by this zombie idealism.

By any means possible we need to get esthetics back, and by all means possible it will bring ecology back. If it is done either by logic or by a trick of reason so be it. But the natural order, is to have also the artisan and the artist in his hyerarchical niche of existence; where it is really his churches and his novels we must celebrate, in which the present nihilists, dissatisfied and functionalists, and the get a job people, actually dwindle and flail within this of all things very useless society. Artists without which garbage would be absolute, and when we readress the artisan, it will likely be quality resumes a higher purpose, above garbage. There is nothing subjective here, other then the subjective reality against which we must protest. Any fisherman can say the oceans are not killed by his doing so. "I'm just a subject. to trawl is my subjective consideration." However generally oceans do exist. Which Kant apparently would not consider. If you would show him the oceans depleted maybe he would consider the ocean existed for everyone. Even then we can see much more and assess much more among eachother and evaluate much more so the very individualistic notion is itself debased, but none the less still lingers and vomits out of the masses as some decapitated last gasp of Kants initial construction. There needs to be something to replace it. ONly when the common expansion and hallucinogenic imagination of modernism is considered in the grand sceam, can we also find a whole destiny and spirituality behind it. When we analyze we could say, the whole masses displacing and misplacing things are waiting for the wise, prophets and leaders, as you suffice the masses you waste the resources for actual progress. To consider it was way too big a leap for anyone to be so unfearfull to consider a structure expanding in the ninteenth century and for them to consider we must expand to other planets is key, it all needed to be dialectical in time. Not with each subject if one does n't do it the other one will, more like we fuck up 200 years and finally we'll see the light and we take back.

It was said by scientists that over religion there is no agreement so it can not be treu, still a lot of Kant prevelant in there that something that has to be treu has to be objectively established rather then subjectively established which in philosophy then is not even possible, scientists ran away with the premise, yes, but they don’t understand the least of it. Why should we, for totally offending the premise, care about what other subjects think? Then God could entirely exist. I for one, have considerable amount of credit when it comes to my intelligence, consider this, i'm convinced it is the truth, i'm convinced people can not make it without this as the intervention into society is too great and too treu without it, and still i don't care. I disgust most people that would gain from it. To be knownst the masses, I could die and choke with the truth, i would n't care, if the masses eventually would n't care like that i'm not so sure. They care about a great deal more trivial matters then i could ever care about the truth. Besides that. It is so that the symbolists wanted to unite Christianity with Paganism. It is not unthinkable the Quran is united with Christianity and then with Paganism, and reality of modern satanism could n’t be united with that all too. Even the sardonic and sketchy nature of provocations of Sade and lautreamont and the surrealists and Schopenhauer by that could be united with it. Why could not there be then a united Schopenhauer and Hegel answer? “The dialectics of art” for instance? Why not? Why could there not be a “Ruler beyond the will” and with that we would have defied both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and united them and... and so on. Why do we actually live in this world they thought? Why does not one person actually think for themselves? Why did this people create a new dogma?
Why did not Schopenhauer listen to Hegel and Hegel to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in his turn to Schopenhauer and etc and work out some kind of system, no they exacerbated the whole problem. I could spend hours to weave them together and no one will understand everyone will babble about YOU BE YOU, no YOU ARE SELF INDULGENT YOU HAVE AN OPINION. FIND MEANING they would say i would say myeah i had a white dove come after ic ould n't figure the theory of relativity welll. Owh thats just YOU. WHat is it now fricks sake?

It is not treu that comparisons or allegories ever found in reality might deter from the existence of the beyond, then also it might be said, to have faith is to leave open options, which is keen for future reference, and development, and art of course, as to restrict like science, confine, deplete untill there is nothing. The scientists is more like the opposite to a poet. he will keep squeezing all the life out of fruit literally, while a poet will give him fresh fruit figuratively. Or the difference between the existent, practical mind, and the non existent, metaphysical mind. In many ways a scientist would himself one day be some kind of automaton with prescribed rythms and calculated simple buffoon words. The poet meanwhile has black holes in his skull as it were. He can certainly write delusions, ofwhich today need to be drugged out. They are forbidden, sickly things. Madness. A perception on the dogma of the breeding pod life, the family life, the mass life, to which science will find providence and answers for this madness and for the ails and ills of things that obstruct an ordinary family household and income. WHen we read untill here we can see already that these things are faulty. Hegel was wrong, the prospect of the future is not to have a satisfying life for everyone on this planet and the end of dialectics. Clearly, everything was obscured all this time.

Generalities and systems lead to particularities and fragments, they never however apply to them. Thoughts are like maggots in the snow, enjoying their momentary death in lack of anything rot, spilled by some angelics heavens from nowhere. And they petrify in this snow and stand as art.And they are never treu, and never real, yet time space and causality is somehow in and beyond and throughout them.



Well they develop the "positivist" notions now that there were millions of grand composers wasted in evolution; Like wasted tree seeds or something. But rather, would n't we not consider that, all black metal bands are great composers, that does n't mean that all Hitlers soldiers would have been great composers. Time creates a new purpose and a breed for its own purpose, not the other way around, which would grow but cancer and something that could n't even perceive. We would just be celebrating and having faith in the “other” a “new” metaphysics. We rather celebrate what time space and causality provided, which is in any given case not what scientists today nor Christians nor modernists would have you believe. It is the romantics and symbolists faiths. For which they would reject, but now are destined to become the new worlds imagination cathedrals, for which we must labour more intricate, meaningfull stories, robed with the notion of beauty and ecology. And the meaning and confines of beauty which is the quality of the artisan.

It is up to the individual. So it up to the masses as they are the majority of individuals, to be knowst having laid the trap that they should think for themselves, which they don’t even remember, as they don’t do research no r study to great length philosophy or anything deep. They buy cook books and as they are alerted to think as subjects each their own world they dig deeper into the pit of their own selfishness.

It is not treu that mankind is merely a parasite. It can create from a desert a forest in any given scenario. It is just merely treu that to the big majority, the future will form itself, some red carpet will be rolled out, and it has not to do anything. But fulfill its own desires. But this is not so much in accordence with the highest of mankinds perceptions, genius, metaphysics, martyrdom, sacrfice allegians to flags etc, and even the concept of dictators or enslavement, or a state with soldiers and doctrines of faith alike.

"there is no ethics that would n't be otherwise based in an affect of a person equal to the person who corrupts that affect, which is in his turn this affect"

It is legio of the ordinary person if not shutted with arguments and just left to his subjective reality, that this ordinary person or the majority, the masses thus, would clip every rose petal and every flower in the perpetual nagging of his that it is just like an ordinary person, that it acts like this or like he or does that "too" etc. With this it is powerless and no flower can ever grow in its hands. It just clips it off himself. It is here that only prophecy, superior metaphysical lessons or mythology offer a floor plan for which the masses labout. Who in every case scenario had been given a home, they did n't deserve, they did n't build it for themselves but on the laurels of what previous generation they would have trodded on. And by all means they are still not satisfied?! They will never be satisfied, and then even complain about being satisfied.

It is very considerate of some prophecy that judgement was considered a debased, unworthy call, a thing of which wise and genius later did not to other with then mock the people with cynicism sardonicism and corruption and immorality and vuglarity. Still six billion of out seven billion is filled with judgement and has no priorities at all, the rest have other priorities and really resent the all stash of corpses of so many a perpetually debatable reality status. A pit of screams, of which he returns can never laugh again. Or indead a heaven of despair and anguish, mockery and rotten vanity. Of which who saw it, would cast himself, if he was a wise man, to the silent tears of the lonely muse the most divine. And if he traced some idiocy and selfishness in more people that got sucked up by that sky, he would venture on, perpetually seeking purity.

"If commerce decides that anyone at all deserves anything at all, then it is not treu value does n't exist, then the merited and the ones who know nobility and esthetics deserve an infinity more then that."

“As they said about philosophers; “as if the peasents would n’t get their harvest from the meadows regardless of them” So we can say of this modern society, if they don’t manage the earth properly or build lavish castles or gardens or palaces with marble sculptures and paintings? What can their popularity or philosophy or their presumed wealth bother us for? Let us conspire away from that all and for a new reality to ourselves!!”

The trick of meaning is, merely poetic, not to refer meaning to itself, meaning once more, or not to refer to existence and then have no meaning left, but then there were those that came up with meanings beyond that, and that never stopped stops or can be stopped. And to some, the meaning in itself, as decorative as nearly a first stage to infinity and amount of beautiful objects and conveniences do not constitue pleasure or meaning, and then all the mythologies to it constites no pleasure or meaning either. He is plagued with a lack of curiosity and joy in life, addicted to newer things and lacks a faith or a pleasure in older things. He has become indeed become a metaphysical creature, a death in life, a nothingness, something that can not be thought in life. And then you would ask me? What is the meaning of life? The bravery merely to fill in a single thing with its capacity, and by all means filling it in with a question is the most beautiful dream and gift to a child or a philosopher.  

Clearly if the universe collapses, also peoples moderate precious little house would collapse, clearly if the solar system would crash then too their little precious house would collapse. If the earth would collapse, their precious little house would collapse, and if the state collapsed the whole provision of society collapses, and hence, their precious little house could collapse, what everyone is talking about “each subject first” is therefore amazing for me to consider. If you care for them in the proper order, then subjects would be having a vested interest in management. If subjects care for themselves they will become the rats in a sewer as clearly is going on. For these presumptions you need the notion of composition and valuable educative allegorical systems. As nature central. This modern cult of commerce and money is created by all philosophers of the past, it is only fit we therefore destroy those notions again.









“That everything or a divine being is n’t there, and you choose as a divine point, is just a choice crystalizing. It serves no other purpose. So to make a religion out of nothing, out of basics, out of survival, and a bleak dogma. There should n’t be any surprise that it leads to a bleak world. The equivalant of metaphysics is courage. Pride, and the furthest you can reach with the imagination; That you reached beyond and then saying we have but a world split in millions of different points is merely to make the world creators blind and to make the prophets numb, or to be one self a prophet of blindness. What one believes individually will be his own delusion perpetually, a sacred delusion. For one to promote to others a sacred delusion of nothingness falls short of a sacred creation. The “average” will always crystalize if you do not have exeptional but an average, or the “Nothing” will always crystalize if you believe it?! And what is religion or faith then but a word? We see a divine constellation of images that are beyond the natural world, in every case man oriented, even aliens are deformed human species. So man central to composition was never gone, but deformed, and in atheists and satanists God was never gone, mere deformed. Its a premise you can not escape. But if you reason without form, or sane bound to poetry, you would in every case thus, produce a language without images, or looze touch even with that. The serene form, in any given case, majesty, the plot of civilisation, the unusefull considered, the mover of our whims and the searching faculty and mystery of our future is God. The constellation of deities and angels considered serve him as algebraics of our senses and beliefs. And everything we can hold dear. And then they considered nothing was a worthwhile consideration? Because did not the masses make religion ill? So that the thinkers need to free before resume? It seems they dug the grave of civilisation with their words like tombs for 200 years, notan ounce of life or life giving consideration. But as there is no time, there is no limit to the depiction nor of the faith of the beauty in the future.
In any case were are now the lot of forsaken children who have to solve it all, and have been given by the wise of the past 200 years nothing but owh there is no point we don’t have anything in common beauty is not universal and so many others, and as good children, we have to ask them, now why would n’t there be any point to life? We deduced that from the philosopher who said we were all broken apart? Then still it can be my own opinion to deviate, but somehow it had to be treu for all people that we were pertually lonely and could n’t prove anything right? And now we see this world? Are we not digging up all that we could just as well create or innovate? Are we not building the same esthetics all over again? Do we not all have to agree and seek to agree, snug and comfy as it would be, to destroy the point of life, and if we’d agree on that, we’d be so happy. So forget about subjectivity. If it was the only that makes us comfortably to agree on just that. Then there is no subjectivity!!

“Not to understand is also your will not to understand, where a horse gets blinders by a human, your will to be stupid is entirely a responsability when everything is subjective. THEY TOLD you to think for yourself and you should investigate for that, find there is something, wrong with this world, if you think shoving pills up intelligent people making them fat is evolution, and everyone can act normal and get a job and cut their hair and before this family instrument the divine corner stone of reality, before that, the red carpet of evolution will somehow be rolled out, and there is no other concerns in this reality, that is the end all be all of evolution?! Well. That is what YOU understand. It is entirely WILL and also why everything you do will be a FAILURE. The red carpet for you is not coming?! In fact the whole of evolution is at an end BECAUSE of you and your delibilitated notion and conservative mainstream reality.”











Manifest against a hysterical Democracy Led By the People
The problem of Subjectivity in Modernism
And how it projects into matter.

Tractatus Hystericae Democratiae A populo
Problematat Subjectitatus Modernismus
Projectatet Materia quam

The notion of this crisis of subjectivity correlates to the fact that not only do people who have very little greed for religion, if you have not religion or esthetics you also greed more for sustainance, then consider family life and breeding is all you need to do. This is a perpetual dead end?! To an artist and always to an artist an extravagance meant so much more then life, this is the simple essence of metaphysics, no science not modern philosophers should dare to break it or conspire to a world of the superficial and the uselessness of the ergonomic, as the unsustainable and the "crapulization" opposed to "aristocratization" of life through this ergonomics. in other words where the nineteenth century still was some kind of civilization, the twentieth became some sort of crapulization of the prior indiscrepancies and crisises.

Art is a matter of generosity, and the most generous artists are usually the best artists, as their seductive whim knows no bounderies to the extent of their quirks and coils, of what that art is.
But Death and Waste, is still the indication that you have a feeling to care, what is not generous can never understand Death or Waste by any account. And of that there are many.
 If you sit at a public performence with short sleaves or if you sit there with otherwise all covering clothes then that is a nuance, a detail of irony on esthetics, if you sit there as an adult wearing a cotton diper that is also massively ironic, if you sit there wearing a throw away diper it is again more massively ironic. As throw away diapers are apart of more irreverent treatment and less artisan.These things are the universal truths to Symbolists and to them nothing is subjective other then sins against the utmost level of beauty, which is indeed universal as their truths, and the divine can not be proven, just estimated, but none the less shines in a symbolists heart always, as his despair, his hurts, his frailty, or his prowess. Nothing therefore is subjective, all are degrees of beauty, from nature, from the classics, to modern irony. All can be understood and described, as criticized, as categorized into systems and equations of thought and the mind. Everything equates as a provocation to random esthetics or careless esthetics of the mainstream and its lack of care for composition. This subjectivity then led to other considerations of composition entirely alien to nature, and a despair into technology and composition as there was no composition, and no tomorrow. Yes indeed it turned to this advent of a stationary sufficed planet. We mean to get to a root of debate on beauty here. As it is, if that would be subjective, it would dissapear, and some people, who regard it as the only thing, or have a high standard to its presence, would collaps, including the religious, who have religious feelings, opposed to people who don’t know what they are talking about, opposed to those people who are, inherently without orientation and in themselves, hysterical, unfilled humans. We consider there is very few with actual religious feelings, who have a need for metaphysics, we consider the amount of people that need to be filled with it, is even greater, in a time where media merely caters in a pluralist way to people who are unfilled, this leaves a lot of despair, and we stuck in the middle. And that can not be tolerated!! Not could it be tolerated in classical era, not when it would be traded for pleb morals, and certainly it can’t be traded in today when there is ever more need to be aware of what composition for this planet would be keen. And how to get there. Subjectivity will certainly not get us there. Besides that there is so much talk about this notion of subjectivity, while at the same time we are reminded of this debate we have to be part of, like some hooked up androids, having to be part of a general discussion. I KNOW what the general discussion is. And I don’t want to be part of it. Merely I wish to appeal to artists and intelligentia underneath and lead into, again, some more composition.
If these artists are found, and their ideas are presented, unfortunatly we migh get a lot of attention.
At last then, we would still like to build arcadia, for those who had already been exploring the rotten books, and chose to live in them before anything else.
Yes, arcadia, or a refuge for dreamers, we are in the gutter, if we are left. We are spawned, and not understood, hence we need our own reality. As I started it and can be considered one sizable amount of dreamer to reckon with, I have already set up some designs for us to retreat.
"It is in impoverished modesty, that i feared, dreaded, i would be in a world where i would be forgotten, trampled over, spat out and scoffed, kicked and resented, an intelligence, that you no longer need or study, a past, that you no longer have faith in or admire. But to my own great surprise, and as you will witness in this manifest. All of that i love is the only glory, and all that you are in modern era, is doomed, it is beyond contestable a fact. And where you did not want to give me a bread, because it was for the horses as you told me when i asked, when i could build you a Taj Mahal, or more specifically where i stated i could build an art nouveau lamp post. Well, i’m sorry. I win. You looze. And yes the last will be the first in the Kingdom of God, i actually believe that. Be it that that kingdom is here, that anything you have n’t got if you are not of highest brilliance is your life, and that everything that is taken from the first, is poisoned in their own hands. And will be perpetually more poisoned, in absence of a brilliant mind, to bid them anything else, this is just the course of reason right now.


You could clearly see, that Sade is the right wing of individualisation, and Schopenhauer is the left wing of individualisation. Of which i embrace both. What on earth the government is for is mere illusive matrix building for as many amount of rich or underrich peoples. Of who’m together pay the taxes, of which i am a fan of destroying the entire shamble, which proposes that both radical right, as radical left want to destroy it each in their own way, and of which, i can say, i also both mutually embrace. Right wing, for the sake of culture, fascism, for the sake of what buildings and palaces need to be built, and left wing, for the sake of moral justice and individual freedom.

“there is nothing strange, curious, let alone hidious of having innovative and challenging thoughts if they are based on the very tradition of all classical thought. Of which i read some, and absorbed even much more then some. That people who find this world self evident somehow find me alien and dispickable. Is why i do so much more wrong with this text then i initially wanted, as i resent them as much as they resent me. But contrary to popular opinion. I did n’t start this game. I am still in a innocence of childish brilliance as far as my present and past is conserned. And if you have these misaligned grimasses on your face, i best have you removed from my direct vicinity. And not have you shout your pompous vitriol, or even your lack of understanding, let alone lack of care, into my face, or even on the near remotes of the internet.

The heart is the mine shaft worker of reality. The mind pilot of reality, looking down on the passing fields. Simply because we live and think in a world of opposites, we are blessed, science can never hold back dreams, that are more terrible then that. And that we are atoms in a greater whole. We are more terrible then that. Of which also this and relativity is a big blob of ink, relative in its own right. And is n't it for that more beautifuL? We have our genitals for a shovel to harvest extatic and to entice our moderate pleasure, a chord, a nervous system of our will, and we have our eyes, that were to see, but did n't see. In that situation, it is the spirit that needs to proclaim. I SAW something. I FEEL something. Rooted, seen as the body, but none the less directed to the future. Not to the misanthropy of subjects and presents as the present is. The present is distastefully misanthropic. Now we have made it so, that you need to be misanthropic, among these self proclaimed subjects, to walk into that painting, that we ourselves have to paint, to walk in that. And are we not eager and greedy then to do THAT ourselves?? WHY would we trust in Gods to build oceans or to make sure the rivers flow from the mountains to the shores, we can do that ourselves now. Why would we have? The new? As we have no classics, classics will not be crafted out of nature, we will build our own nature, and our own classics. A grand decor, and craft it so meticulously, and then indeed all is kitsh.

Therefore the scientific posture will Always be a judgement from YOUR perception; And the own perception will Always be a war against SCIENTIFIC perception. Science and psychiatry, treatment of disease etc wants to essentialy atomize us. While our hearts will Always consider we are immortal as stars are, in that Coral we build, in the art that we are as we are alive, and of which plot convulses in our minds as a cancer.

It is simply BECAUSE it was just a story, and BECAUSE i realized that out of the subject you could not get out, BECAUSE i walked in an abyssmal fear for six years, that a white dove to come to me, after reading the theory of relativity at the same window, and i could not get out, BECAUSE OF THAT we can consider light and matter are one, and time and reality is miracle. And its not JUST a story but stands all what was created hard as MATTER, And by that, i say, Heathen Gods are Legion under one God, Etherith exists to certify ALL that, and Magickal theory all the same. And by that I declare there IS an ideal composition to earth, and a reason to spacetravel, to sow the gardens of the earth, on all the deserts of the universe. And without Metaphyics, i could have never had such FAITH, in absence of metaphysics, there is but idle atoms, and no truth. When there is considered, no truth, you still create worlds for that, and out of those worlds, you could never venture without metaphysics or truth, but that metaphysics is hence ESTIMATED, or DISCARDED its very notion. Its not NEEDED, so you can say, the white dove does n’t MATTER. And still. She came. She IS matter, kitsh, i can use her now, to my poetic delight, call anyone for a sign, as a conceptual artist then. For that it does not HAVE to be metaphysical, sign among symbols. But it is all that I considered. And from that alone I could have considered it.

Gravity will decide.
With the added disadvantage you are your own gravity.
You have to carry your own emotions your emotions will not carry you.
Your mind is the mast, your emotions are the ship.
So you have to read a book and get some theory to do something with.
I challenge you to find a substance in these modern books, some exist, few, who realized the grand determent, there are not enough megalomaniac books for a megalomaniac age, so there is not enough truth, in an age that ironically considers itself as much.
As much as it is kind of quirky the United States citizen will say “we are the greatest nation on earth as we strive for this that” whereas I can pretty much say that with some plus or minus a few details standing in belgium Russia or China. That the United States is bigger then they think is quirky here, as much as you will find that, untill you read this complete manifest, the subjectivity killed so much genius and pristine content in its entire mainstream and in its rise of the most popular individuals, that it is entirely the same slob usually, and that it can be defined very differently then all atoms of that slob and the entire mainstream currently estimates, an awareness, indeed brought about by Kant and then Schopenhauer and then Sartre, none of which needed to quote the origins and the surrounds much. And of which thread grew completely blind and obfuscated now. At the root of the matter, is something entirely different then what you, the mainstream thinks, or what you, as someone trying to oppose the mainstream right now thinks.

yur not just chemistry you are also faith
chemistry is a process that you believe in, you let yourself be moved like a stone, while you can be a stone with wings if you use your soul. Merely the act of existence, makes you more powerfull then chemistry. Because the next moment makes you more powerfull then a stone. In effect you will always have wings, and if you believe you are chemistry, those will become your wings; there is no escape.
Logic, the stone thinking it is a stone becomes a stone with wings, and so on.
Logic now. You are a stone, here is a pill, here is your chemical construction.
Solution. 
WINGS!!
THE ARTS
THE CRAFTS
THE BEAUTY OF RITUAL
A stone is a means to a ritual, it is not the height of religion to believe, any philosopher could tell you that it was not so or this and that, it is the height of religion its rituals, churches and its art. As material value, there exists that. 40 percent of culture is either churches, fiction, etc, the key is the serenity, the beauty of the imagination. Which could be anything, but for which clearly if devised a ritual for it, is in itself metaphysics, as a stone does not in itself grow into art. Nor does it realize itself. It is not treu as Schopenhauer said, that if a stone could think it would consider gravity its will, mankind can consider its will, where it reaches to art and ritual, as metaphysics. We serve a higher purpose, the coral of churches, composition.
The balance of what you could achieve and not want no more in life is death. Mankinds perpetual self sacrifice to ideology. Finally we are all dead, always, as we adhere to something higher then us, most of you, and as we are high, as myself, we do not want what we could have. I do not want to rule you, you make me convulse, that is how i choose to end my life, in colvulsion of you. Don’t emulate me. Then you already adhered to a higher power did n’t you? That I should have the patent to convulsion, is only envied by my brothers, who need not envy me, that i should be self indulgent, is only stated by members of an inferior society. Who for a moment as a modest subject as they usually are, could not meet me in the self indulgent of a subject, but needed for that the piety and modesty of civil turds, rabbid grannies, and dispickable bitches of who’m the subjectivity was written for and in which they relish indeed, incapable to oversee the grand picture.
IN subjectivity, you baptize yourself in a caged perspective, that you are among consumers, among time, among this time. And its gross and sick and disgusting to have to do with subjectivity. To have to do with consumers, time, this time. If you say and so many repeat, we are atomized, and you need to be atomized too, then i’m sorry. I am a sun, and I have something which proves i have burnt. So you don’t have to. But by all means, absorb some light. YOU NEED IT. The very few in the future, could have figured it out. Most of you. Will likely fall pietous in the future for it, while you scoffed me and had your eyes and snout pull in retarded and yet hysterical defiance and dispise of these words. And for that I am workinG. So it is so it feels like, to a be a sun i imagine. You can spit at it, so often i was spit at. Usually though. And spiritually. I am at peace, as i know, your spit will pour as a poison spit of angels back at you. Like your acid rains.

“And thus, the classics are classics because they are old.
And the modern is modern because it is new.
So something that is new simply can't look old, as something that is old can't look new?!
When the new is old. The ritual of the classics becomes the time of Now again.
And the ritual of that life, becomes essential again.
When technology has rendered life useless.
Then life, becomes entirely self instillment.
And nothing what i just said, and everything that leads to the irradication of life
Is what you hear in this world
Describing the crisis as all do, all documentaries and text.
And offering none of the answers.
It is a logical answer, to the art of technology becoming in itself defaitistic and with a lack of faith in technology.
And answer to that however, is schewed, and far between, and deep in histories past.
Sink with me, to history. And realize such awesome amaze, that we are at the beginning. We built the Sphinx. We are not distant to it, when we stretch time and stand so far from it, we have constituted a belief of a lack of grace. And with our minds, we destroy time, and reassume grace.
Its all in your mind? Are you strong enough to destroy time all on your own?
You need someone to lead you to it.
Man, even subjects had their prophets.
No doubt. You need another.
A Matter of Personal Grandiosity.
A MATTER OF PERSONAL GRANDIOSITY, HOW GREAT SHOULD A SUBJECT NOT BE. WHY SHOULD IT BE MODEST? AND IF YOU ALL ARE MODEST? WHY SHOULD I BE APART OF YOU? IF YOU ARE ALL JUST? HOW IT COULD IT POSSIBLY NOT BE A BIGGER FAILURE DISPITE THAT?
"Fire is pain, and i am fire, water is docile land, peace, the present, and matter, and life and the future is steam. For I have come. And the future begins!"


To position myself in two ways let me first have myself positioned ethically and politically.
ETHICALLY AND MORALLY
As defined to a psychologist of psychiatry.
yes thats right.
scientific analysis and fiction also is a position, you judge.
A journalist, by being objective, judges, as he puts the judgement with the viewer, who, does n't exist.
Everyone judges by not judging.
“The world is what you make of it”
“develop yourself”
“do what thou wilt”
Fiction, creates by not creating.
You have a culture of which you nor anyone in psychiatry is apparently capable to understand.
That makes it a religion.

I said
read a classical book.
So you can learn to speak, from yourself.
You can't just be an individual by everyone developing theories on how to become an indivual in the past they were individuals they did n't need to be told.
Your entire series of systems is one dumbfounded paradox stacked on top of another.

New medication, less thoughts, you don’t have to aproach me with another debilitated “psychotherapy”. Really i’m sorry but if everyone would tell what i’m standing there innocently defending as a philosophy. And also If you would get the doctor and clear this thing up, as i asked a thousand times. All i did was revolt against a society which was sick as a rodent in a nuclear waste disposal facility.
Trying to build a philosophy which you with a ZERO remedy and a ZERO philosophy and a ZERO medication try to sabotage. Indeed, the visionary, vision, psychosis, thoughts, etc, and which psychiatry wanted to give me meds from the very beginning; because THE PROBLEMS THEN and the SOLUTIONS AND RAGE NOW are not acceptable thoughts. But psychosis.
But that was never the problem how many times am i supposed to tell you?

Yout entire system, is zero, no religion, no sculpure no image, if it was scientic then STILL you could n’t stack five grains of sand on top of eachother with it.
Your system works out a deficit for which i’m looking for the cure.
And that is a psychosis of all things.
Why would your science not be a psychosis?
Have you actually thought about it?
Why should YOU not reflect on things?
Don’t you think I could be an authority on analysis? But owh right i’m psychotic because i think too much??
I have naturally the tendency to think a lot about psychiatry, the consequences, and also the DUTY of me as an artist. Not to be the savior or the moral high ground NO. HOW I have to rock the cradle, HOW i am to DESTROY society. Which artists actually do.
AN ARTIST MUST FIRST BLAST AND DESTROY ACCEPTED VALUES, Der Blaue Reiter; i quoted that ten years ago already in a paper adressed to your psychiatry of twat zombies everywhere.

IT DOES NOT STAND OUT DOES IT??
But really, its not getting through to you. You have NO cleu about analysis. Its not about anything but fermenting your predispositions about your psychiatric divinity.
Too long watching the news, and took over the twattyness.
Completely knocked out and stating down, no chance to get to any insight.
As i SAID, read something.
You refuse to do so.
So you are stuck in their world.
I figure you have n’t even read A Brave New World or 1984 or Animal Farm. I don’t have to read all that shit i understand very well what its about. I live in it. And i understand that those writers have also written this world, as Christ had written the Middle Ages.
What do you think I am doing?
Are you reflecting yet?
No can do?!

I went from the beginning on. "we have a problem here." i said "that i'm thinking this is all insane" i meant the interior, this society. AND YOU considered. "owh my your just intelligent, so your paranoid schizophrenic, and you need a little pill? WOULD n't that be PART of the problem. But SOMEHOW you are not going to be able to deny intelligence? YOU ARE IN A TRAP??!

Saying authors of the past 200 years are just subjects is saying Christ was just a story of fiction, he did n’t intend for anything to result from it hey, people have their own opinion. But in effect we are truly in a wormhole with thought today. I’m just offering a few ways to get out of that here.


POLITICALLY
I have developed my culture from scratch. As everything was subjective (at least for me twenty years ago) i also wrote fiction. About the babble. But then realized, you always preach. No matter what you said, and so i fell back twohundred years. Because none of the modern philosophies add up. Marxism etc, kapitalism, suffice the masses no matter what. And indeed, IKEA closets are not very ecologic nor are they even necessary. if i just watch the stores everywhere in the main street here, a capital of diamonds here Antwerp by the way, state of the "art" stuff, but its all garbage, like main street clothing is garbage. I can certainly consider there is jewelry artisan made and clothing that is worthwhile in the underground then. Ahahhh, artisan and underground, things i happen to defend. I can also speak about Hitler in a stance where his conserns over democracy and the problem of subjectivity are considered, apart from massive political plays back then. Schopenhauer had his philosophy from INDIA hinduism? Swastika? Nietzsche reversed his theory? Hitler had Nietzsche as one of his favorite literature? I am in constant philosophical analysis, i have not made up my mind. As i probably create a lot of atrocities when i don't remain objective. Being so objective in itself is perhaps hidious!! But i'm also insane. But Nietzsche INDEED should n't be made worse, to me they were all part of the subject trap. Part one of one giant culture of which mass consumption is very much the polar opposite. But i DID already see a common thread in this "don't judge" why on earth not? Okay. Let me put it this way. if ALL advertising was banned, and replaced by academic ideals and art nouveau serenity. THen you would have another society right? And that society can work throughout all that exists right? So how can i not judge that entire society? IT EXISTS????? Not to judge is not in the least an argument to stop me from analyzing all commercial garbage and bad quality shoved into the people who, are, eventually, and finally kept powerless DEU to the fact they can't judge it. It is exactly because i judge that i'm fighting it. If i said I shall not judge it i would not be able to fight it. You have any idea how many times i said NO MORE IKEA i can sleep on Straw on the floor. I would actually take this as a principle but i don't haaaave to if i do it like that it does n't make a single difference you see? If i eat fish or not it does n't make a difference, everyone says owh make a small difference do good. IT DOES NT. i start my site to make an inventory of all the fish, all deer, elephants, trees, etc. If that was on every newspaper every day people would start to notice the numbers going down. ETc.


“We can say, mostly, looking from a distance, mankind is a creative bacteria that keeps expanding and stacking things on top of the earth. Not so much detrimental to ecology, as opposed to that, motivated and deluded by its sufficing of the subject, rather we can see only composition of man and economy in a synthesis of all arts is key. And considering every nation expands ever more and stacks ever more commodity, -as i consider mankind not as a polluter but an equally natural creator of material and output, processing, transforming.- Considering all that, there are two things known, that a theory of an ultimate composition and esthetics must be found. That it will be extremely difficult; and that we should have already been much further into space if you compare earth and its produce and main architecture and how abundant it has overwhelmed this earth.”

AN ACCUSATION TOWARDS THE FUTILE AND THE LETHARGY OF THE GREED FOR MORE RUBBISH, OR THE GREED FOR MORE RUBBISH CREATING LETHARGY.
because machines took away all your choirs.
So you must reassume life.
You feel you are worth nothing?
Because a machine took away all your choirs?
What a pathetic notion is that?
There are two things you are missing out of, duty which you have and politicians don't have. As politicians have it and should n't and you don't but should.
And knowing you are magnificent. A tool, a catalysist.
WArs have been fought for the ideals to have you live generously.
And now you soil their names saying it was not worth it?
That you could n't make a life out of nothing?
The nothingness they gave you?
The lack of opportunities they broke?
And now we have nothing left!
So can we reassume a victorian, an egyptian, a greek, a beauty, a delicacy, what they wanted most; a moment of peace, or a treat to the taste, or a feat of wonder, art, reposing, a sight of nature?
And see that no history is ever distant to us?
We are all that ever was, right now.
So what do you say to that?
Do we need to instill a fascist society where you salute? Which is necessary, if you refuse to salute yourself.
And we are indeed not saluting ourselves, if all you have is rubbish, plastics, waste, tedious living, outgoing, watching the Mehre.
Economies crashing, and then life will give you your meaning again; Working hard, overcoming our struggles.
Hahh.
We are decadents, artists, we don’t need your commute and transit, we don’t need your modern society. We would not even be on the internet if not you closed our bars where we would hang out, and all the woman who would see and relish in decadence are evenly dispersed and have no more congregations, you are, the useless material, and you destroyed our culture. You are the masses, that have no sense where you came from, and no interest to truly explore where you came from. And you are modernists, who seal off the past with the new, and seal off the new without the past!
So rather then subjects within consumption, which is the polar opposite to fascism, you should all be Hitlers and Mussolini’s with principles for yourself, subordinates to act upon your own merit, to USE money, not to hoard it. TO ORDEN dignity from your fellow citizens, to BE decadent and greedy in erotic please. People to salute dictators we don’t need anymore, slaves to consumption we don’t need anymore of those either. We need decadents to shine using the ingredients of life, ecology, nature, artisan crafts, within the technology that is like a universe, that can transplant a forest from Moon upon Mars, and is but for that purpose technology. Other then that, technology does not even exist. YOU can stroll in a greek forest, or among the columns in unspoilt nature. YOU subject, are in line with a time of subjects. And you feel its need to consume, because you were always religious. If you are YOU, If YOU TRULY DO WHAT YOU WANT, then why do you need? Modernism? The classical sceneries still exist. You can populate them as any culture. You have not lost anything. You have gained, the reason you needed to gain was to survive on other planets and for the structure to grow, to expand beyond the humble earth and to see the earth and to awe deeper and venture deeper into the universe. But YOU, are BORED, because technology? RENDERS LIFE USELESS? Well. Then you need less luxury; GIVE IT BACK, and GIVE TO AN EMPEROR, TO WANT GOLD FROM MARS, AND THAT WILL PROBABLY BE MORE USEFULL WOULD NT IT? AND YOU IF YOU THINK THERE IS NO USE IN LIFE; MAYBE YOU NEED LESS SUSTAINENCE, and more bereavement to work; a carrot before a donkey, if you are so existentially challanged, by that technology, that or just vanish into thin air. If you have your own philosophy then don’t always look to agree with everyone over your triviality. A freedom of which does not deserve the word Existentialism or Nihilism. You are your own Christ for crying out loud. How can there be no purpose. And in that, i improve on all modernists.

The idealists want to suffice the masses, and in that the masses always get more bored and nihilist. You turn them into little Nietzsches and Schopenhauers, detrimental to their own lack of capability to innovation. So to suffice the masses is by no means as will appear the salvation in any way. I mean you have empty walls and people who don’t know what to do but just play virtual games or stare at screens. It will also appear here, mankind is a commodity. As much as a snail, churches and technology is the slugs mans, shell. It is not pollution, its merely the past 200 years religion of subjectivity that destroyed the balance in which mankind should progress. Marx as well as the kapitalist thinkers were wrong. Schopenhauer is also wrong. Nothing of modernity sticks.


Everyone in the past, thought so many, or killed so many, and created us. Time and space is a huge cauldron on which skin in chaos broods bacteria with such awareness, such magnificent and a splendour an awareness, in utter insignificance. each thought thousands of years ago creates ripples upon space, we create ripples upon space. And our awareness is as, a film on pelicule. Whereas actual reality, is like a movie theater with a projector. Do not presume the movie theater, this reality, has anything to do with the film, our awareness. Both do not connect. There is no audience, our awareness it is merely abstract, playing somewhere, aside of reality. Within, on top, a simple invisable layer. At no point does reality and the film have anything that intersects or at any point becomes real, or we could say, not at any point does our awareness actually become aware. The awareness never really touches the projector, the projector never really touches the objects in the movie. THis is the highest spirituality in art and truth. A point even beyond Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. And of which as soon as it is said, does indeed, change, and as soon as anything else is said, for objective truth, changes things into subjective lies. Life works, hence, this is a lie, unless it creates. Truth is objective, hence its a lie, since it does n't create within and without. If you invented a clock, and you decided the clock projected objective time, but it would just spin incoherently, then you had made an unfunctional clock, a clock, an irrational clock, therefore if you make an irrational clock, and it works, you have found time and truth. In that way we can see that religion actually works, whereas the age of science has no direction but to stack technology on top, democracy debates without buildings or culture,technology suffice temporal needs and has civilisation expand while its strangled by lack of leadership. Books for the functionality of books, are not books, digitally printed without a craftsmanship… If you had something irrational, to state a beauty, a focal point, out of which came a direction, a center to thought, a fixation on something moderatly objective… Then you could streamline, compose, a society. But this can not be done with the instruments we are using now. Logic, does n't work, we need to SHOUT and POINT TO THE PAST, ARTISAN, RITUAL, INCORPORATE IT, FORGET THE NEW, ITS A LIE!!
The new was the excuse because everything was subjective and everything was supposedly done. (the mind is so strong, essentially this in itself was religious thought derived from atheist sentiments.)
We can say now that in the loss of serenity, if we manufacture serenity out of what we found as common denominators out of the past 200 years we can travel backwards.
We can craft myths, setup a definitive composition for the earth. Create new, significantly less absurd rituals, (or more absurd rituals, franly i thought of crowning myself with a swan placed on my head and marry a woman against her will and proclaim we are elves in the Gaudi basilica but nevermind) etc.
"To observe is to be in awe, and to be in awe is to write its poetry, we are the machines that bleed melancholy over the white sheet of universes deserts."

"When you are looking deeper into the universe, even with mathemics or should we say, in thanks to that. You are looking deeper into your own mind."

"In the same manner a scientist will discard belief, and in the belief the earth is flat, a scientist will always be trapped in the flat earth of his perception, not that he is n't capable to understand the universe, but that his perception is spinning rainbows of poetry against the sky. Always, be it Gods or Mathematics, let us see it needed not be always stupifying and silly deities, at least, from that we have not fully recovered from killing God, and creating fiction. I am now killing fiction and science, and creating the first esthetics. Based on none other then Symbolists, and setting the course for an actual fantasy in reality."

"What i provide is the inevitable analysis, from which 200 years will come to an end, and out of which you will emerge, a Kant of Perception I will be. I don't contest it, I basically reverse his system. Because even to contest it, would put me in its trap. To tred in his footsteps however, would create mere empty walls, virtual meadows, and a universe filled with skyscrapers and garbage dumps, and that is not my poetry. To satisfy the subject through communism or kapitalism after this, will seem a very vague memory. Once these pages have gotten from mists to matters.

"We never understand more then write poems to our own perception. Therefore we must write the poems and build the composition of our own perception. Perception by any means is a ghost, of which art is spirituality itself. And you can never go beyond that. But certainly modern age has been living in quite a bubble."

"The hubris of faith became the hubris of understanding, as the cream of poetry faded into distant forgotten past. Now we must have the hubris for esthetics and poetry again."

"Its not so much that you understand time and place, its that you understand within time and place, that is of the highest notion and what you understand, and that time, and place, is undoubtedly spiritual. As The enlightenment and how architecture has evolved details. Our attitudes is the only thing we ever come to understand. In that we don't really need a psychiatry for the delusional, as they experience it how they wish, we need a psychiatry for scientists and modernists, as they want to document a thread of living without art. I am now in psychiatry. But i will be redeemed some time. Scientists on the other hand, their words with which they will spice their theories, will go on the garbage of passing fashions."

"In essence to speak fantasy or religion is art. To speak art is religion or fantasy. There is nothing outside of this. Fiction or Science does but smudge on the reach for the arts. But never aqcuires the poetic core of merely to exist, and to make a mockery of truth. Which existence, is also a mockery of truth. And the ultimate scientific theory will need to confirm at once, that the universe is a mockery of mans truth. Therefore God and spirituality can actually exist. Because we FOUND ourselves scientific, not because we had some illusion to find a rational procede to the universe, that would leave us perpetually in the drought, that there was no poetic credulence, on the contrary, as soon as the subjective is attacked, you can see, nothing of modernism is left. Nor its notions of science."
The religious person will say, it is so, what we can not prove is so, and this surpasses new evidence to the contrary. The scientific person will say, we accept no truth then what new reasonable evidence provides, forgetting that they claim laurels to a destructive force of civilisation, which has made few things progress other then expanding a bacteria. As an artist i contest to both of them, a barren molded wall the books of poetry and the wood in a fireplace with severe cold, and a leaking roof, is still all that I needed and wanted, and deserved. To craft more sculpture and chairs there, with my own hands. Is my life. For you to say, we craft it syntehtically, and owh yeah we have no subjective truth so we have a new up to date item, is a DISEASE??? It is not however the scientists nor the religious. The scientist who explores and delves out means for swelling the structure, but not in the least "progress". If that would be treu we might as well intravenuously shove coca cola in our veigns and staire or be inserted programs straight into our brains. This system is a critical system of Kant and 200 years of enlightenment. And how it stopped at some point. And how it conjured us in a misunderstanding. I am saying that anything outside Kants critique is good enough, as it would provide us with esthetics, art, artisan art, and poetry. Anything still within it. Can provide only a fading into the abyss, in which ever more abstract presumptions lead in the black hole of verity and establishable truth.

The black hole of establishing truth still meanders on the notion of understanding, as if it would be a notion of matter, while understanding is making understanding, even mathematics is, which is a process of light. Therefore no understanding of it can be absolute but the study of beauty. The means to have society go further is certainly successfull. Though the merit and the composition of it is debatable. That we WASTE science and WASTE technology is considered here, and then the perfect balance which would be expected of any eco system would be different. And indeed it would be very different without Kant.
Through discoveries of the universe they say, we broaden our consciouss, but it is through seeing the world through Kant, that we see no more masterpieces on any wall, of what counsciouss we went for, and that dimension we left behind. And that is, the oration aspect of art proze and poetry. That is not even a speculative notion. It is what science now does, but it does not more or less rightfully so. Then artists, of what artists now have to do, and what prophets did before. None the less, the person who wrote this
A already figured that problem for six years.
B read the theory of relativity and found nothing in it to be qualified to solve it.
C had a white dove and after it made up a lot more stories, simply because
D it should n't matter if its just a story
but saying it is just a story certainly makes the serenity and propensity of the story different.
WHy is that?
So here is another story, induced by a religious event surely.
But i have n't decided yet.
It is my nature to doubt even science.
As it is a black hole above beauty, as it is a black hole over perception, as it is a black hole over poetry.
What comes then?
So, this having a white dove somewhere in the story.
And an authority to create vampire and angel and elves cities somewhere at the back.
Is not irrelevant.
Its just a solution i propose.
And which will become ever more urgent. No matter whether i live, die, or even become immortal or ressurect. (which latter are soon and already possible i might add)

"What I would n't say to scientists is you can't prove a rational consideration, It could not possibly convince me of any myself, so i rely on it. But I will say, science can not deny mathematics and any devise it invents, is not part of its perception. Therefore the pragmatics and the ergonomics get flipped all in advance for spiritual purpose and poetry, and this is a consideration not thought of for twohundred years.

If i want you to pick up on anything here, there is two ways reality could go. In the future two out of an infinity of ways it could go already exists. The earth to become a desert and all the deserts of the universe to remain deserts, or the opposite, the arts and ecology to be at its optimal on all the deserts of the universe and on the earth. We are at a ultimate convergion of those lines. It does not need my recommendation. You WILL choose, ALL IT TAKES, for ONE of these courses. ALL of you!!

If an accidence is what constitutes as the chaos indication beneath what we would consider the desirable etherical of understanding and reality. What would then not be higher or more fortunate coinciding of perception. Or opposed to an accident, the body in a pristine condition is spiritual, or even higher spiritual notions as the consideration of those things that seem on a higher plane then chaos, of which has and will always exist. If not that then art. But ordinary civil life can not be the standard of reality. As it is today.

By the very means of scientific reductionism and positivism, i'm afraid your understanding of what the universe means, to a poet or artist, or prophet if he would exist, seems entirely relative. It is indeed merely the expansion, of the species, and was never about the progress of the species, and in that, I have become a prophet as well as a scientist, one with a white dove, as well as a plot for the future, how you can beat that i'm not aware, perhaps by trolling or going on travels indifferently to objects of past prophets, or working for capitalism mocking there needs to be ANY value on anything.

IN kant Scientific notions on perception began, as the fluid, hyperfluidity of religion, but in saying we have each objects for each us a subject, and we do not really know what is behind it, he surely did n't see much, he was surely blind, he surely tied the subjects to a common purpose, that mankind would be center and each subject should be center. THis philosophy and all its offspring over the past 200 years we simply can not accept any longer.

This premise would lead to the notion that, Ethics is perpetually relative, it is always ones personal feelings how one equates to ethics, now the masses are trying to mobilize which ethics should prevail as supreme body. Its still upon themselves to get a giant kick out of their mass indignations and conformities. That is all there is to it i'm afraid. I would personally have execution squadrons for civil life and mass preferances. Because what is the mass and civil, is also the bleak white wall and the blatantly superficial hogwash on the screen, and the hysteria that they feed eachother. As if popular culture were in effect a vomit being scooped up and fed to the masses over and over again, and all this culture today, is basically just vomitting the dark as light romantics and shitting it out again and scooping it up again and feeding it to the masses again. They scream, and they hear themselves scream. Now the artists can and should say. But i'm out of a job. And i built the Taj Mahal. What are you going to do now civil? More instant synthetic houses? More instant synthetic products and leasure and amusement parks and entertainment centers and decors to be buzzed to your screens and and...
Nothing here works. And this is my critique of it, how it actually works, and some plans on how to solve it. As living in the suburbs or the cities is no fun and fair game perpetually, and as they perpetually growing worse, and from where we stand, it is already a big dump now. Wait till you see what happens when this manifesto is not understood?!

I also contest modern notions against Mars catalyst being for the development of the species not being the same as US discovery, by that logic the Africans would say "owh wait, we just crossed the river, going to the US is not the same, we HAVE technology. THAT IS why it is used, not de facto can be reduced actually you are thinking the wisdom is better then the means, which is probably what Popes thought about their churches, which we contest now too.
the people who spit on me now, will be the most fundamentalist when that time comes, that is usually the case. A troll and a leader feels invigorated by his being a subject now, because thats what they said twohundred years ago. I'm about to change that perception here. That i change that perception, gives me the right to state, i would select civil individuals, and line them up. If he is an artist or a thinker, let them go. But why can't the idealists put the masses on the pyres now? Clearly they have done it again?? They have left all reason behind, and gotten into a new religion, suffice me, no matter what the cost, give me an opinion, no matter what the cost.
They should be burnt, and artists and wise are seriously sick of their charade today.
Underneath they dwell.
If you thought you had not needed them. It came as a surprise to myself too. I'm not entirely unnecessary as i myself even would like to believe. And definatly that gets my opinion in a front line with all these people who say. I don't matter pall, you don't matter pall. I have a slightly different opinion indeed, should i be prosecuted now in your subject world??? I already fought with axes, and been in psychiatries in cold empty cells and spat at and gazed and laughed at for so long. Your collective indignation for i would be busted in some beastly embarassment right now and all for you seven billion to see. And I still would n't give a rats ass about all you pathetic slime. I got even positive and negative comments on that, first off i would like to provide a lesson to youth, hey, get it in the collective atmosphere, second, if i would get scared, its probably how so many can spit bullets with their at best, chopped up turds for a mind. and with that mind, comes also the alien prospect, the prospect that you are caught that you can not believe, you simply lay out courage and nobility, and they will stare at you, and burn you, and laugh at you. Laugh at me, shove injections in me, in THIS SYSTEM? but i will never forget what you did to me, in some previous systems.

The actual point being, yes, if you would let me walk on the Moon, or sent me apart of that message, i just would had a flower with me, and shoved it there, when i was before that awareness, i just wanted to destroy myself without that philosophy. But you had, all the fun of a lifetime in this world. When I was before that awareness, i thought superficial babble was truth. Untill i found some indescrepancies in the general philosophy of the babble you could say, and some massive cohesion and comformity too. In myself even but from which evil i celebrated, and from which evil you are not eager to learn or to delve further to disembowl society. You will actually for these days months or years, piss in my skull to have given you an option. For which i should reserve no other right then to dispise you. THAT, is natural. Prophets of old, gave you directions, they marked the walls with words of light, prophets of modern age, started to dispise you, what you always become, and it is always safer with you, to be the villian, that you dispise, and that dispises you, then to be the saint for you, and that corrupts everything by you. And believe me, i am one of those latter prophets, I am a villain. You would n't have heard of me before!!


"That I could trade each car worth on average 6000 Euro for a stack of classical arts the height of cathedrals and not have a single traffic jam and not have a need for tourists is the systematic religion of stupidity over beauty contested of today."
But to an artist they will say, "get a job" wellll.
Building or working for the supermarket i suppose hahh? Why don't YOU get yourself personally aqcuinted with a PEASENT.
At no point I talk about the actual morality of individuals, i merely make a case for esthetics and a revolt against the assumed conditions in which esthetics are bound, and claim that there is no possible esthetics because of the fabric of a family values synthetic manions stuffed with more synthetic products. Modern kapitalism and democracy have flushed all thinngs that are dear down the sewer, involuntarily aided by the progressives and such likes as the surrealists and Sade. We did n't WANT that! It did n't result in what we wanted. We have to destroy society AGAIN, as we destroyed it BEFORE. Apart from morality and the societies temporary vacuous pulp it spouts we are concerned here over the lasting effect of the arts, in which we walk as we are dressed, which we build as people spout their nonsense, and which is therefore the only valid consideration really. As psychologists say we did n't want those padded cells but use them anyway we can say a building and the fashion forms an atmosphere which is stirdy and real. As the Mythology goes to matron this site "the end of reality" is the end of the civil reality in which the reality of art becomes impossible. It is here we object and accuse the civil of which substrate their society does n't contest of anything valuable, worthwile or profound. The culture indeed, from the romantics onwards, has done nothing then to degenerate into carton board. As the earth is piling up completely with the growing desire for garbage of the masses we assert a few basic notions in philosophy over the past 200 years to read them backwards. And to provide an opportunity to assert the notion of "composition" again, over the notion of the "subject". As a personal account to be demoted gradually out of academies and galleries because I concluded some Duchamp artwork was just a factory assembly line, to have considered why is n't there if there is subjectivity and individuality art nouveau, art deco and romantics and baroque, to have considered "if it is garbage and it is laying on the street",... "is it art then too?" to have considered all that and stand with an artisan sculpture at a cheap civil store with the industrial mail boxes and the industrial Marie Antoinettes and Louis Quatorzes for the civilians, while you then walk through their formless expressionless streets, then you find you are very alone, and run along a very strange and abberent course once more. I reversed everything they said, and i ended up at the complete reversed side indeed of the spectrum.
indeed, in the gutter, or as a slave, you will end up as an artist or a dreamer, apart of their struggle to survive, which will leave nothing beautiful left from the past. Apparently if you give nobility money from the masses, they will build beautiful castles, but if you give everyone a job and satisfy them, there is nothing left.

And so clearly here and I already concur in a practical sense, if anyone on the right wants to recuse himself with this as it would be a so called criticism of the left and pluralism and not in the least conceptual art and the modern art BUSINESS, then i should already say that Marquis De Sade and so many others definatly were n't much of a traditional people so that we all need to resort to traditional lifestyles is a complete fucking fraud. The aristocracy bought the ballerina's for a one Louis d'or or so. So don't tell me about traditional values and decadence. Its on the contrary way overvalued today to an extent that is sickening, and which the Surrealists tried to destroy in the first place. The right advocates dishwasher soap adverts of which newer and ever newer irony of the triviality of that world I am so sick of as the state propaganda of today that i have no good word for the mainstream political right wing. As much as i severely dislike all this "pluralism" With not a nightstore to more elegance and raffinement or a supermarket for that matter,... in that, multiculturalism is a complete fraud as well. We live in a concept, an industrialized debilitized concept, and this because metaphysics went out the window. Well i have a few solutions for both left and right. But the degeneration of modern leadership will come to an end, it can just as well be done by monkeys, horses or worms, of which most people are who vote, and most people are sick of themselves. Time to add some problems to the heap. There were some philosophers who said the satisfaction of the proletariat would lead to collective suicide, i'm not entirely against that. Basically i hate the adverts and the passive nature of the proletariat. Especially when its fulfilled in its delibitating notions of art. And by that i do declare i will not rest, not really, before that now after that atheistic drivle of modern advertising it is deemed for companies to just pay taxes outright and not be able to advertise. Or for the products to be cheaper and the people just pay for their own "entertainment" that i can't even stand either (or in the case of black metal is a modernist paradox). If their products can not make a profit THEN it will be their own merit but these cults developing all over the place. And this polarization should end and also the polarization of left and right I want to end it here, to get to some actual fricking business.
Which should n't be business then anyway but BEAUTY.
We talk about a gradual developed notion of physiology philosophy, we talk about why something authentic as leather is beautiful and lasts years, and something as hidious as plastic lasts thousands of years and we throw it away, because it is essentially hidious and worthless.
I just stand on the planet as it was 200 years ago, adopt their sense of esthetics, and debate with this whole notion of "subjectivity". I admit, but I don't have any other choice. As no other choice is left at this point.
Know that this site was not built by any bank or capitalist endeavor but by a minimum socialist insanity spending of the Belgian government which accidentally forbids me to take a loan, drugs me against my will; and is hardly enough to keep me alive in any desirable way. No bank would even lend money for beauty and spirituality. For that reason anything you do that results from this manifest is essentially religious and esthetic in consideration, a thing that is not even supposed to exist today, so it is tax exempt. I considered building a well thought out temple of perception. Well a loan was also denied for that. Now i can design the logo of that bank to a form that befits my site. So it does n't stand out too much. And becomes an actual classic worthwhile consideration.
Furthermore if i argue we should see to templic orders and debilization free zones for lesbians and artists and consider lesbians having sex is not really sex, (that it beats christian religion even as a higher esthetic and etheric exalting consideration) as even lesbian art or female nudity is not really nudity. Etc. Then you could consider that in a male dominated reality in some insane quirk of reason. But you won't get away with it. I'm more principled then you think.

Its safe to say this machine means to delve out the sensitive, as they sympathize with what you say. I mean if you call someone like that a neanderthal or he is among your gossips he will feel terribly delusional and feel seriously nauseated. Most people all this bollocks it just bounces off them, they have no pride nor a debate or a word that gets through to them. And if you say something it is always someone else, they are never affected, its always the others with their cars and the others with their trips and the others with their fancy mansion but they don't have ambition for that themselves or feel entitled to it, and they just troll like there is no tomorrow. To an artist to create is its own reward, to be brilliant or to live is its own reward, but they did n't want all that garbage especially not with people who become disrespectfull to anything and everything when they have their own space. You own where you walk, and you are as much an ape as you can prove yourself to be. Modern people are all such clumsy nobility, that I do not choose to be part of them, nor does any artist we affiliate with should become apart of that. We can devise our own magazines now. We hope to find more artisan printing presses, as your entire culture is absolutely useless now. Its very strange for a Byron to want to be part of the high class and of the society at the time. Me myself i have lived long enough to build my own society. Owh i have a few already, and wade through thousands i don't want to be apart of. Well. A different aproach. I want to be apart of people who want to be apart of me. We embrace here very much the creed that a poet is only understood by other poets or himself. We have come to a superb realization where all your modern civil people have n't got a slightest cleu what or where this should lead. To those who are perceptable of it, those I can weed out, i will weed them out. And pull them close to me. The others need not troll me. I was n't meaning to be part of you anyway. You are when not being constructive entirely redundant. And likely you will go insane, along with your entirely useless society which is determined to support you and allow you your own voice and its presumed worth whatever it would be.

This is not a site to post "sperm on the shit" or post your dinner, at least it will not be on top of the whole fricking world wide web as today.
We have priorities here.
If you are a genius and have solutions, post them the way they NEED To be done.
As personally I have proposed a few, if we see all the despair and anxiety in metal and rock and the increasing despair of those, and the increasing despair of anorexia and riots, then you will realize something is seriously wrong and no one is fixing it. Making hollywood movies without ideals nor telling you whats going on. More over pop song vanity like "where did all the intelligent people go" well. We are fighting, but when there is all pop stars in all academies and courts and governments you know, its not easy.
Now i'm sure when the world that WE NEED and not all the babble, we will have the support of the sword militaries of black metal black romantic sturm und drang, whatever you think of mr mainstream, they were the ones who clearly saw there was something wrong. WHAT that is you can read below. Also we would have the support of most people who listen to the MUSE UPRISING song. AND THAT, 200 MILLION, WILL BE ENOUGH. If they all support the solutions, then the others can just realize it, then we have an army. But currently its ALL going to shit. YOU GOT NO ONE ELSE. I made this machine to get something DONE and to mobilize all these so called entertainment armies. IF then the military see that these are RADICAL solutions to RADICAL problems, then maybe we don't need politicians. As far as i'm concerned, give the fricking leadership to VAN GOGH you know.
AS I TOOK it anyway. The point of me gauging my eye balls out having listen to you all and standing here all alone was pretty devestating. You wou'l n't have survived in my case. And you long would have killed someone in my case, both of which i felt, but surely it would have all gone in a pretty hysterical way again either way.
Lets hope this machine will find me my fricking apostles.
Yes we are here for a critique on kant, which would again lead us to the speculative, because we HAVE to?! It was already absurd Kant had influence as much as it would be absurd for the left to have a doctrine that does n't allow right wing opinion. If the right does that we consider it fascism but if you are not allowed a fascist opinion in a left wing doctrine now what is that? Same goes for subjectivism. If it becomes a philosophy then what on earth sense does it make?
It is a problem I had realized, and some had already realized, none more extreme then what happened to Michel Foucault in his last days. But that i was walking in fear of this problem for exactly 6 years untill a white dove came to my window. Now that may be "just" a story. But why on earth do we make "just" stories now and not allegorical stories or religious stories because it is "just" a story and there can not be metaphysics. Ahahhh. seems metaphysics was never what we thought it was either way!!
We will propose here solutions as the friction and quality of artisan expression and female central to composition, for beauty, "imagination ether", for God, "Exeptional Serenity in everything" for morals, or rather the code of the distinguished ethical behavior of the characters to be presented as morally fit, and the corridor of mirrors, for possible touches of perception that treat of a higher order of evolution of who'm can not be proven. How can a bee prove its own radar in its head when it is in its head??
None the less these as the beginning notions i described in the dutch letters to the academy of Antwerp should make a beginning for a whole new psychology on spacetravel as beauty and imagination.
The claims of the occult to radicalize the magick in society and see a supreme destiny are just part of the same culture. It is treu that here they are radicalized by exactly giving UP on these theories.
And if you don't mind, i already soled all i had to build the site, so choose your taxes and pay up. We need a 3D model of the entire planet HOW IT SHOULD BE, and HOW TO GET THERE. To afford that and to organize for it is not easy. I also need to be payed. Since the government or capitalism or banks don't fricking have the dignity. They did n't pay for my temple of perception and basically everything i do is 200 years old and should already be in a museum so yeah, there is a problem i see in capitalism and communism and the modern state alike. THis is not time for Van Gogh to die and invest in his fucking paintings when he is dead, it amounts to nothing. Nothing is proven with that.

Now we will also have support of the official militaries. The german was fed up I heard, the US military i spoke to a few, they think mankind is destined to EXTINCT.
Now in that time excuse me if i don't say that everything is "just subjective" nor do i tolerate you to say that or consider these notions refutable or otherwise insignificent.
I EMANCIPATE the revolution IN A PROPER WAY.
YOU NEED INTELLIGENCE.
What trolls pop stars politicians, tourists and businessman think of that is not my concern, i'm not here to listen to THEM.

Now tactically my testament is already made. IF the democracy is incapable to save the planet, the military can execute any citizen and take the beautiful woman.
IF YOU DO NOT SORT IT OUT
YOU CAN SHOOT ME FIRST
SO THERE IM YOUR MARTYR
but that is a TACTICAL ISSUE, IT CAN BE DONE AND MUST BE DONE IF YOU DONT GET IT WORKED OUT
YOU DONT HAVE RIGHTS TO LUXURY, ECONOMY, FISH, YOUR OWN FACEBOOK PAGE OR ANY OF THAT MORONS;

SO GET IT WORKED OUT THEN?
TRY AT LEAST?
there is NO FISHERMEN not understanding that the ocean is almost dead.
but its always OWH I AM JUST A SUBJECT IM NOT KILLING THE OCEAN
like me saying OWH NO, JUST ONE CIGARETTE, that CANT KILL ME.
so its always the russians the chinese the US he gotta do shit he gotta do shit, he is a pedophile etc.
None of that matters now.
preservation of the species on everyones mind and on everyones profile
as it is here on the FRONT PAGE
AND ANYTHING TO MOBILIZE THAT
i can offer agreements between left right, black metal, catholics in this manifest.
SO GET READING.



You can consider most people who are not posting memes or diners, or for that matter short derogative commentary, who have profound thoughts, are currently speaking to a wall around them, because they have no more media left to them??? Which drives them to suicide, the sensitive and whole direction of this culture of subjects is not easily described, and the insights to understand this culture are not easy.
For this reason we mean to have AN ENGAGED encyclopaedia and community for ACTION and not saturation of your selfish needs. We don't do analysis and science here, and stack every classical movement away as if any artist today is n't influenced by it or can not have influences out of it, and if he then can not get quotes in important magazines he can not be in an encyclopaedia. Well excuse me I do baroque and romantic art and symbolism and end up between industrial letter boxes i can get a quote among Baroque and Romantic artists so other artists of that nature can find me so i can talk to my like minds. And other directions in culture should have the same privilige, none of which are taken into account by modern media or the encyclopaedia.
Its time to restore the planet.
Nobody is doing it, they think saturation of an bacteriological colony of subjects growing without composition nor by any means should the best ideas be ON TOP, yes, that will get us there??
If there is an idea to restore something. You get it not in a newsflash
if there is a philosophy to mobilize people, you get it not in a newsflash or not even bother to publish it because hey, we need cook books and travelling journals.
If there is a detrimental sickening of the ecosystem, you don't put it in between commercials, if people get bored of it, then maybe you should let artists work on it so it becomes a little more appealing and provocative then adverts which people are also sick of??
THere is no debate necessary between left and right, the new decree of this society and the new issues already lay entirely elswhere, the problems that i see this society to have are severe and certainly at a profound philosophical level.
Since its the philosophers who brought us here??
We consider unlike Kant that composition of the planet comes first, not the subject, that beauty comes first, not the subject. As Kant would have gladly said the same thing by now.
Dispite personal taste, an artist always gives a personal, Always unique kick which is mutually received in the same exaltation by other artists. They usually butt out of all the art of critics, of who'm their duty it is to offer subjective perspectives to other subjective perspectives an infinate corner of reflection, reflection and testing the pro and cons of every merit. An artist IS a perspective, usually without judging other artists, contrary even he picks them up and joins them, no matter how down trodden they are. The moment where you compliment another you join the extacy, the moment you lack enjoyment you become a troll. There are some who are wondering, where you wonder what does get them to enjoy themselves, these people are then delusional dangerous psychopathic scumbags who. Where in history there was no biggers stack of treasure and artists effort, from art to transportation art etc, in all, everywhere art. And they failed as yet to be contented. These trolls would also include the mainstream who simply do not mind art, or who carry on regardlessly with bacterial hive mind perpetually onwards, without thinking of a change of course or a radical change, they can not Phathom passion or living without society. They are the unfilled. Unfilled people are basically now creating the void of arts, the economy, thinking this will all work out this society. The unfilled people have n't got a cleu and they are the democracy. They are the subjects who, where everything is offered to them to state something can state as only thing that "everything is subjective" and there are many like that. And in hyerarchical terms, most of you are closer to that then me. You have all said it at some point, i keep wondering, what is that, never once believed it. I do not say do what you want ot think what you want, as i can't know what you want to do or think. How could i advocate that then? I don't even know IF you even think??? So how absurd would it be to consider to tell you to think for yourself? If i don't know if that is at all possible? Now we find, that there is indeed a society that can't think for itself, its called modernism and minimalism today in general.

"I am a hopeless romantic, but to think my weakness and innocence for being powerless among masses drivles is very wrong. My passions i derive out of loves for young woman, paintings and antiques, and hates i derive from modern society. They have culminated in a blend, toxic, rotten, disgusted, all conventions blasting, and final end to all civilisation as we know it. And you are about to looze all you got. That you somewhere thought to be free and also part of this society, i will prove as error, that I am prepared to die and already killing myself every day for actually having the position that I have, with seven billion imbecils, but i dare you, to read these pages, and start to realize other then to lick the screen for what they are, wealth and splendour to those who understand, if there is anyone left to understand, and ruin and running around for anyone, who thought dreams would end in the land of fiction and rubbish and adds and medias fifty trillion lies. You thought you had me. Now I will return with a few assaults of my own. And if i die soon. There is only two things to know, it will be my sole and only my own greatest pleasure, and it will be seven billion peoples greatest loss. You realize that before, or after, the choice is yours. Before there will be infinate amounts of jewelry, mined from Diamon planets, and i can decide who gets what. After me, and when i'm gone, you all scream in endless despair. Those are the odds i as an intelligent person can see before me. Again, the choice is yours. I'm just walking through. Never liked the place, the interior here has a lot to be demanded of. I'm the interior decorater, i wonder if you'll like my aproach at all. Or find your subjectivity comfortable, maybe you change into a butterfly some day. In your psychiatries or your bubbly cars or your insulated homes or where ever you are. Your interiors, bly me, somehow we imagine, you agree on a lot. And you have disagreed with me together also more then enough."



"the greatest reveletion to mankind, and which is why you must play Game of Thrones and other farming and empire growing games more often. Is that you do not have modernism, the new, or subjectivity, or smartphones. You have absolutely nothing in this whole world then what you decide to do NEXT. Please make smarter choices, you know shit. Some solutions could be in here."

CHAPTER OF MANIFESTO ARTISAN MYSTICISM
TO THE INTELLIGENT
Glad to finally get in touch on fruitcake planet, I don't need to explain you, we will discuss how our minds got strung up, beaten and pulled out through our nostrils while they stole the media, left us among idiots and civils and zombies to rot. They actually forgot apart from civil babble planet there were also theorists and philosophers and artists who always developed new frontiers and are existing in the present underneath. So if you never spoken to a human being in your life i'm not surpised. Please read the whole manifest on some efforts to get out of the crisis and contact us as soon as possible to deliberate on the correct proceedings and next steps to this planet. I don't have to tell you we are looking for inspired minds, Romantics, Symbolists, Surrealists, people who know what that is and develop it further. People with a general notion of theory. We mean to form a solid group again as the Surrealists, or the Romantic poets and have ourselves heard. Right now there is nothing but archeology and no life, any provocative word of us is strangled in the commercialized morality as the deficit of these days working against artisan arts for our desired complete esthetic revolt. As the Surrealists said, "we can not have the bourgois win", as it is, they are loozing while they are at their peak, time for us to step in!! Now we know these books are around, (Rudiger Safranksi, Schopenhauer translated everywhere, Kubin underground, The neverending story perception ideals In the Mouth oF Madness, Wings of Fame, The Matrix, Dark City, etc. we know someone is reading them and watching the symbols. NOW lets speak to some people who are actually alive, who read and have the capability to FORM AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION??! TO CONSIDER AN ACTUAL THOUGHT ON CULTURE... I mean these people build sites to clogg up the system with pictures and memes and hashtags regardlessly and forget some descent theory or where you come from or a manifest among this puddle might be very necessary?! Peak civil taste and no one has a cleu. GOD if there is Holderlins or Hegels or Spinoza's or ANY philosopher or author out there not caught in the stupidity LET ALONE a St Euliala or a Joan Of Arc of which i met a few undergound already. I MEAN TO FIND THEM ALL!! WELCOME and merry meet Jezus Holy Fricking Christ!! What a shitstorm this was hahh?? If you want to go back before the degeneration of tv and before the degeneration of the internet, as soon as the civil took over each medium. JOIN US!!

What would you say if i invite the 1111 noblest woman to lead the earth.
And me and the rest don't eat fish anymore for three years.
Maybe under twelve they can still do that.
They did n't chose this.
But over 40 you should have really been looking around like. Whats going on? Not just playing games and watching tv shows; I mean your in CHARGE????
NOBLE YOUNG, AND BEAUTIFUL
those can exist yes.
IF we had a 1111 liv tylers to rule the world would be a better place
and for some reason, thats a very good idea.
We build them a senate, and thats that.
No one will get them out of the news, and they must act dignified and elvish. So in front of a cam doing eye liner is not going to be in the works
They will be a new aristocracy.
As it happens they also likely will be immortal.

"but man you have to read my manifest i'm utterly lost YOU DONT know whats going on? I swear? I mean people need to see the connections??? I mean intelligent people i need to speak to and build a fricking movement against this twohundred years now WHEN are you going to see it?
Schopenhauer said, retreat in arts
after Kant said, everything is subjective
Nietzshce said, the aristocracy should play with the masses
Marx said, subjects need to be sufficed

I mean this twohundred is complete bullshit, THEY DID what THEY SAID
HOW CAN IT THEN BE SUBJECTIVE????
In the analytic being a dogma it is not very analytic, in the speculative being a necessity to survive without technology and to be apart of nature, is not very speculative. We argue Imagination cathedrals are a much better idea then the past 200 years blind faith in progress. We argue the past 200 years romantics and authors put in churches is, something they would definatly be against, but none the less, worthwhile. And most of all, just. As this culture has since degenerated and can't breath without a revision of their ideas. That some of them wore modern clothing does n't mean they could n't be represented in a simple monks attire. Where TS Eliot said the masses would scavange a dead planet, it seems he was rather pessimistic, the masses are still consuuuuuuuming to their hearts, even if they have to sit in traffic jams half of their commute to work and half of their leasure vacation. You could say then he was a monk as he probably would n't have deemed it so self evident. And in his core there is still moral lessons here. Not so much in latest achievements distilled from it, if at all a genius is considered here in these realms. And then here is me saying they are all wrong. When you venerate them, i geuss you could say i have a pretty strong stomach for self indulgence, but even in times of subjects there need to be those, little is expected owh yeah is n't it just market value hahh. Thats what we'll tuck you into and then you don't stand out so much anymore. Problem is, i have not the slighest intention to have people invest in my work, or stand there to attract some idle attention to me. Those threads run DEAD. I don't NEED to give you masterpieces remember? I'm already provided by the well fare state. And even now you say, owh your brilliant, but people will not know untill you have died. THE CYNICISM, does n't end, particularly since now they can publish it THEMSELVES. All it would take is a bit of spamming of citizens to get to the eminent authors of today and the thinkers somewhere underneath, of who'm are few and definatly not served nor awarded by popular opinion, so i had to make this encyclopaedia to find them!!

I mean many people today claim to be open minded because they look at the stars, because they are thought that and consider it now open minded if they do that too. But did you ever consider how many cars there were in 1920 and so on in 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 and 2020 and how many there will be in 2050 IF everyone wants to get their telescope at the supermarket to be so open minded, but to see THAT there was only ONE of those remember? And you in your short sightedness called that what? Overpopulation?! But it has been going on for quite some time. When the first trail was made and it intersected another tribe and those started to trade, that is when the seed to overpopulation was planted.
And for two reasons only.
For your decrepid system to collapse, i have a holy belief that the simplistic notions that you do have, the rabble notions need to die off. And be restored a rule of eminence, of merit.
And i have another reason, for mankind to survive and overcome more then its local habitat, and sow the gardens of the earth on all the planets of the Universe, how about that for a mission.
It was in the cards all along!!


I mean if the nazis were invading or growing in germany, a leader asks the citizens of the UK to make sacrfices and work. But now the planet is dying and all the leaders apparently are saying we give you this and this and that please vote for us and offer no radical solutions to the problems??

Now, this machine was built, because avant garde and classical mixtures of a revolt against a society filled with subjectitity is a paradox right now.
No longer is our revolt the aristocratic or the intelligent against the civil or the plebeians, now we revolt against the subjects, who have become to believe nothing else but to be saturated. This is absurd. The absurdity of modern consumption religion is considered here, apart from the detriment to the composition of the planet.

"Trying to teach the classical language of the classical books to people who don't feel for that lanuage because they settled on the subjectity philosophy, and even not knowing how that subjectitity philosophy works is the greatest challange of ethics."
Should we educate people who do not want to be educated?
TO the very least we do need a planet to survive; and THEY vote and for THEM all the main mansions and skyscrapers are built. So.
To oppose that question. The author of this manifest against subjectivity has himself been part of that philosophy untill 1999, and was writing fantasy about demons killing eachother and burning the book they were fighting for. But that philosophy can clearly not be maintained? I saw that. But what now?
For all the opposite we could argue, the right wing, the rich should and traditions should prevail. Or they should somehow "play with the idiotic masses" but why are they not doing that? They are sufficing the masses with rubbish that kill us all?
So we can clearly see we have a new religion here.
Of which scientology and psychiatry, consumption and communism, are all apart.
To offer a way out of that religion is offered here if you read this manifest. You don't have to think forward anymore. You can look back and say it was a big mistake. Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche. All of them forgot something and made mistakes.
A child does n't know, it is looking around, investigating, not babbling, but asking questions, attentive, and inquisitive.
By the time they are 20, they are subjects, corrupted by entertainment "i don't care anymore" "what can i do" and they HAVE to or in other countries are INVITED to vote. And then if they don't care anymore and think what can i do? They just mean to vote to survive all for themselves.

"I'm sorry to say but Kant could learn a great deal from Hesiod, if he just wrote about farmers and wrote a mythology, he would n't have done so much damage as he is doing now considering everyone should just consider themselves "subjects" and then after that its either play with them or saturate each subject to their own taste. This is detrimental to the challanges ahead"

Humans are a commodity. They can grow things, if you say everything is just subjective then they will destroy things naturally. A humanist is basically a tourist, and a tourist is basically a humanist. It takes up a lot of matter and builds on to its supermarket and skyscraper complex. The added benefist then create more people, etc. Its neverending nihilist society. Nietzsche could have not conceived of how much of a cattle people would become because of him. And because indeed for the resentment of the classics because of the a radical concept of a "right wing" attempt to take power.

"as much as we doubt the use of electrical light in a church or in the house of a poet, this is a general principle where an artisan reality is really all the faith there can be, the faith in kitsh and nature, and the modern "conceptual" reality is really all the nihilism, how can you have a poetic or faithfull serene sense of reality when everything is wrapped in condoms from a factory, the development throughout culture of these notions and the frustration and anxiety of "the kitsh people" and the spaceification of reality is really what we mean to delve in to here."

"We are saying that since Kant and Subjectivity most people are actually making art for subjectivity sake and some underground branch is making art for nature paganism and satan. Which is both or at least to some extent pretty absurd. Except when mythology and imagination and Satan are patrons agains majority debilitation and for kitsh and beauty - debilitation of which is through subjectivity indeed happening, even if the massive grumble against the majority being stupid is part of the majority attitude paradoxically- " (We could safely say that a politician to run on the campaign slogan "most people are stupid" gets elected by the majority of the vote.)


If modern human beings, with all the extra wealth that they already have, can consider nothing but their own survival to their interest, then they need someone to manage the whole composition properly on the top level. But if no one has any idea of what is going on you get a kind of hysterical freak show which we today get. The old philosophers don't apply anymore. No Marx or Kapitalist thinkers would in any way consider the traffic jam of individuals all standing on an entire plane of asphalt ergonomic or preferable.

This as an art movement identifies two different qualities exist, beauty, artisan and kitsh reality, gothics, black metal, dungeon synth, regressive or reconditioning. And the mainstream who is entirely ready to fly in space with their mansion playing computer games. On average those two things stick. But mainly through saying "do what thou wilt" you create a giant aristocracy with ever more wishes and ever lacking modest and ever breeding more hysteria. Quite exactly as we will learn. "Analysis" breeds analytical architecture, books, lessons, dishes, culture. So hence, the speculative, has no less value then the analytical, on the contrary even. The speculative is very necessary for culture to survive. For the humanists and the athetists and the philosophers and the left to conceptualize their opinions, conceptualize the opinions of the past, conceptualize reality with it, and conceptualize the arguments anyone who does educate themselves might have is a detriment and the culture of "subjects".

"How can you help? Just believe in A dream, a beautiful dream, crawl into it and never believe reality once more. Survival to mankind is not to the fittest, that is but a hurd and crowds indifferent of tribes desperate fist fights of apes, naked, it is on the contrary, survival to the greatest dreams. Analysis is to stifle all dreams and to go way back, untill suits and politicians spew up like the sewers spew their lids and excrements all over the streets. Now we here will show you what a dream is."

Basically, if an aristocrat would lead society you could go to him and advise hiM; But where do you go now? There is no project for humanity, there is no one in charge? There is 4000 people who know about the pending death of the oceans? And they are operating on a philosophy that everything is subjective? THose movie theaters have a responsability to tell the masses, "the family" that we are almost dead??? If Adolt Hitler had a rule and destroyed all the ocean the Communists and CApitalists would attack him and get him on the gallow? But who do we hang NOW?
Then again, if the structure is expanding, we have a severe problem that can't be fixed by democracy. (fortunatly and, to our pessimistic delights) I mean how you going to expand naturally and democratically all priviliges and luxuries and also confiscate those or at least recycle those according to kapitalism for the next fifty years, where we have a development equivalent or even higher then the last 50 years?? How will the center of the solar system, once populated, be able to go beyond that even, if the structure expands we will have a universe crawling with humans before we know it and then some??! This seems unsurmountable!! But if nature did n't deem it preferable over just sitting there in Paradise plucking berries for the rest of a by the way very short eternity well, then it would n't have happened.

"Again, the balance has moved too far. A cell phone or an Ipad could have been part of a Victorian or a Baroque or a renaissence world. THat it is n't possible IS the whole religion today!? To see that becomes an obliterating, startling paradox, and the only way you will see the present culture and with it, philosophy and science, for what it is. "

The land of subjects is the land of babblers, subjects asking questions, all articles without use, all policies without any calculation. And it is doomed to fail, and it is destined to be overcome. If the common weight of the subjects own conserns without much care for the general well being taxes the planet, and if all politicians are there to saturate that. Then we are not going to make it. It is indicative of the strong to lead and to demand sacrifices now. Sacrifices that in the commercial bubble seem very strange.

"This is an entirely new SYSTEM of THOUGHT, as much as in the romantic tradition there are systems of thoughts. This is not to be compared to an indifferent word salad without critical thinking or judgements over society and esthetics, ethics, science, human counsciouss, reality, and sociology. And everything else to be considered with and under and above those as there are science, establishing facts and vision or metaphysics.
It is in its entirety a critique on the critique of Immanuel Kant and a new beginning of subjectivity. For each some treats it will have."

"It is not like modernists systems wacking words at random at little puppets, we had philosophical investigations in the past and recent years, here is a solution to various problems. In all as a rant and brutal force, but nevertheless dispite its energy still well considered and entirely pragmatic and very usefull clearly."

WARNING TO THE FRAIL MINDED
If you do not keep your head, and not your mind at the tip of your toes, and are not capable to do be constrained and dilligent and considerate of values. You may go insane of this book, I will give it my very best, trying to dissolve the words in your skull, if you fail a certain elegance to the meaning of word and the image of word.

The courts of the past would gather some eminence and innovating intelligence, or at least a decorative notion, since now every official instance is status quo and/or building the Matrix we need to devise our own media, we can do this by uniting an already raging underground, metal, gothics and cosplayers, which should eventually gather the dispersed classical crowd who still reads the old books, who have nothing to unite them no more, -as the classical thread was lost to commerce- and develop a world again from that, with the intelligence hopefully finding this manifest for all of us to reorient and devise a renaissence in all philosophy, arts, architecture, and technology, any field really. We consider that, the old moulded and rotten books are still laying around everywhere, some people are still reading those?! I rather speak to them then those who adopted their thinking by reading modern cook books and stale fictions without a stomach. We appeal here and reitterate where the thread of Schopenhauer which always runs dead, in Mainlander, Hartmann, Camus, and other threads in Sartre and Foucault all run dead. That is why society is dead. Now we assume a system as Schopenhauers is not fit to evolve, its like a wall you can't build any future on top of. “Look for meaning” none the less is n't actually a meaning he is proposing, at long last that "look for a meaning" in itself drops dead. That was Camus, it degenerated, I mean Schopenhauer clearly stated it should be art, and by the time it got to people he influenced it was not even that. You should look at people when you give them Christ. Well now look at them when you give them apes and mould, well what did you expect?? At some point you have to write about the meaning you found. Then you have to BECOME a subject and not just state everything is subjective, which is an entirely different thing. So if we don’t find an individual and if everything is so subjective we still better go back to Christ, because at least he was an individual, if it is objected he was divine, then what on earth is that but art?? We can just run a life of a marginalized citizen and get our sink and our toilet plunger. The next thing is the serene, the divine, in art, as we need to grasp it to prove it. I wanted to destroy myself when everything was subjective, then at long last, and after a severe word crisis, i figured “why can't i decide what i find beautiful?” Why should everything be “just subjective”. This is a nuance each time but quite relevant, most people don't have opinions at all, they say things are relative or subjective, most architecture today derives from it, modern art derives from it. Thus we can say, Kant built the structure. Now how do we get out? "Look for a meaning" or "find your own meaning" or even "truth is power" is not really any answer, which Foucault was also finding at the very end. In this world the only power is not moral, as everyone does, what he does, why should you even stand up for family life when everyone who has a family life has a family life, and if you abstained from that, you do that? What on earth is there to talk about? If you take a bit too far into decadence usually it ends up in prison, again not much to talk about. It is not political either this grand victory of reason and purpose, as that is mere bureacracy and secretary work for the average person, its not wealth or banking as that is creating more skyscrapers and slushing more garbage and commercial projects. -read, goods and services for the average person. I asked to build temples for perception in esthetic styles, i would need to redesign their bank logo. But hey, don’t mind me, they refused. They said they could n’t justify this. If the subject and all these considerations of past philosophers meant anything it is to create an average world and let all the exeptional drown underneath. If we want something truly exeptional we will have to just blurt it out. "Overcome" ourselves indeed as Nietzsche said. And we shall have to rule. Because, this land is dead, they, the fiction writers and philosophers declared it dead, and they GOT it dead?? What point is there now to write “i believe someone powerfull will take over when i see the streets today” is that in itself the occult? Its analysis, so obviously we need to do more then just analyse things and expect the proof of the occult. And if we do analyze it we need to imply some kind of course. Not just settle or wait for some Satan to be proven. Christ by any means was an individual, he had people create art. Of course, my misanthropic nature, most of us our misanthropic nature is still there. But we see this society has bled out. It had spent too much time on its own sequal, looking for something innovating, loozing any language for esthetics. Seems people listen more to philosophers then the consensus goes. If for 200 years they would n't have considered starting on with the subject we would have had quite a different society. It would have been better, everything would not be so average, then again, we exist, and there are opportunities considering there is such a power vacuum and the modernists destroyed all beauty, which we may find a disaster, but also, we may find power in beauty, and restore power AND beauty. If the world was beautiful, we would just be labouring among people,... Considering the world is an awefull mess, we who dictate the beauty, rightfully now claim the power. whereas an artist used to work for the aristocracy, it is now the artist who must arise in his own empire. His art empire, and stack it on this oblivion. So we invite anyone here to comprise their projects, and finish the artwork of the earth. As we will point out later, “there is no time”. We should forget that notion, to believe in time is to be a parasite, its the one thing a modernist apparently still believes in. He is at the end. And then he can make a concept of everything. He can create some kind of minimalist concrete nazi bunker for all the classical arts, and for all the sins and depravities, and tortures and wars, and then the family can go down the slide. In fact there is no time. I can live and craft according to any style of any age i want. I can see things by candle light, and they can deteriorate, all classical genius is today alive. Thats what individualism SHOULD have done?! Of course if you would read older books you would/could, assume that time entirely, if not for those annoying modern recalibrations and introductions. But that is not easy considering the pressure and the dogma's, you would always identify rather with the here and now. Rather then be absorbed into the past, which is to modernists as they usually claim about anything “just a story”. But to take out the nerves of the past twohundred years this will be very easy. And then the modernists are left naked, and the artists can assume their freedom and project a more megalomaniac, not in the least, artisan and esthetic plot. To destroy the modern era has to be done with actual meaning and the reevaluation of the notion of beauty. Not with “look for a meaning”, not with the “we can’t say anything about esthetics” not with the “we are waiting for Godot” or “we are mould on a globe”, not with “we evolve from apes” which prevented and derailed so many of us and melancholics like us into the abyss. There is no one who will commission you. You will just have to propose your work here, and we, as a unity, should overcome the current mainstream and official circuits and bureaucratic bodies, which are now so abstract, we could not bother to study, or cooperate in any level, in essence schools, democracies, parlaiments, skyscrapers, media, everything is dead, innovative, but very dead, sterile, cold, tagged and comparted to everyones convenience in the refrigerator. Who wants to be part of that game without a language of form? Would YOU build a supermarket as they do today? A building? A garage they call a home? Fit it with all their described gadgets, fire extinguishers, fire alarms, obligatory plans of the exit? Or the usual very demeaning exit man stamped into concrete, or the occasional reference to a house number or an industrial logo, and elevators and ahhh, what useless business. Not an aula or a lobby or a sculpture or a velvet couch with a descent wooden relief or what may, just empty walls, empty elevators, with a mirror, naked, for the individual to see itself in its modern clothing, it found “reality” if i see these hallways composed these days. There is no dignity in that, they look like cramped toilet space you could not even take a dump in that. For that matter if i talk about a toilet that it should have this and that so you don’t see the drainage you will have six billion people go HAHAHAHA, it has a drainage you need to see the drainage” and they say everything is subjective?! Even if, as I will mention, if Duchamp would have used Marie Antoinettes toilet and not an industrial toilet, the whole concept would be entirely different. Then. You can see, this age is slightly deluded?! You can not trust a society not run by someone in a lavish palace, soon the ritual of your footsteps and the leasure of opening a door before the sky will be gone. And what was left? A deity you could not hold before anyone. Surely the lack of allegory and beauty is, very general?! Surely the consideration of a deity was general once, and not very subjective, surely there were subjective opinions under the deity? Surely the subjective now, is general, and the way architecture leads our lives is general and not subjective?? Well, who does not believe that beauty is relative must be cast below on the esthetic internet realms, along with castle and romantics worshippers and other deviant artists and dark music enthusiasts? It must be some kind of hobby? Do your job. Create supermarket shelves, God forbid if your hobby should go beyond that. Now all is lost in Between all the manga sketchings? What on earth motivates these garage builders and civil conceptualists to keep working? Yes that THEY commit suicide and we find the meaning of the classics again and verify that and we SHOULD n't commit suicide now there is a worthwhile notion to tred on. Where do people think the Michelangelo's and Da Vinci's and Cellini's and Rodins have went? Well I hope to find you all here then, artists. Then one issue comes up. NOT however how suicide is the only philosophical problem. But how the art for artisan allegory and spiritual beauty can have its theory back?! THAT is in effect the only philosophical problem. And we will have to SOLVE it in these pages. Not just meander on debatable “subjectivities”.
The quality of the imagination goes without saying, pejoratives are for the ones who WANT to live in shit. As. What goes for a dove "it shits" goes for the imagination "its just like santa claus" the divine of the simple dove body. Also is considered in the divine of a simple more worthwhile consideration which is a tale or deity, and allegory of which has to symbolists a spirituality, merely in its divine artistic creation, because it is esthetic, it is divine. We have nothing in common with a culture who all say beauty is subjective and speak in a modern analytic language about life being shit and the divine being discarded as the divine is the beauty of the arts itself. We mean to gather these people, as a renowned scholar of the classics created the background of which has more generosity in communication, and of which background now, we can only fall back into it, as the moral lesson and even analytical established reality today remains no more. Nobody is there to be convinced other then of materially delivered esthetics. Modernism deleted itself, it grew, reached, came up with nothing, and finally this nothing interests no one no more. We do not work for any deity, nor do we work for fiction, we work for the sensual of our loves, and compassion we see, beauty and generosity. The Endearing, the havoc and ominous in our taste in disaster and hates, how we rise up from beyond the mountains, stand there high, and see the masses, pertually in fear of madness. Perpetually in fear of the destruction of the order on which they are the parasites, and of which order is usually already decayed as soon as it is set in motion. Yes we say here in the age of God everthing was done for the imagination, in the age of big sales everything was done for big sales, and we will claim here that that was written, and that that is a religion as any other, and not to fight it is to condone it, you are for it or against it, there is no sitting idle by.

The artist is the prophet of his own work, who gathers from the renown and eminence of classics. An imagination that for your information, always took on numerous variations and strident purposes. -This modern crisis is a mere illusion, if you would sink back into classic books and leave this age behind there is ever so little to worry about. And you could think, about what is, not this hysteria of progress, which was the hysteria riding a wave of death and nothingness. In atheism the imagination reaches a bottom dead point. Now who are doomed? The ones who awe at existence and pronounce or pinpoint a story, enlight reality with a story and give it meaning, or the ones to perpetually have to repeat this one line, the only line to the core of their beliefs?? “It is not” “it is not” “it is not”, and the theories that go with it, they were never at all the brighest, and so much as the deities were part of the establishment. We could master and revel and exhilerate in our protest. But now that the deities are no longer part of the dull and established majority, we can see it bores us, furthermore, they have made a religion again and have gathered around a urinal now. We need the human body as art. Its movement and supreme ingenuity fascinates us. It is in any case the creater, of industry. A God. Its mouth in accordance with its hands developed language and plans and theories and has at times told fascinating tales. Along with the idleness against commerce or capitalism, democracy or minimalism. Whats in a name. No arguments no debate; God simply does n't exist?? And then what? Behold the first lines here in Evol, "God will never die". You can kill him, and that was a noble effort. But he can't die. Its a myth in itself. And then what do you have from such a grand killing? To topple the essence, the supreme singular notion of spiritual overlord, the notion of any significence in any mythology. Well, if I depict it i'm sure modernists will have a field day. But to classics and those to understand classical notions i'm sure we can salvage our wits and words rather, And to them and the mind, rising up from this pile of rubble, we can forget this one side of the debate had ever so much influence and denounced the whole imagination with that God, untill it was a mere gimmick left, a fiction in empty theaters.
The lack of constructive comment and respect for simple pluralistic answers and lack of extensive vocabulary is also something a tad cliched and old, its all over the damn internet i'm sure they have a lot of friends and people to agree with. Taking a hard road on a simple key of wonder is n't exactly any lack of bravery. We don't want to visit these public threads of dumbfounded nihilism subordinates who have nothing to say, they should not worry, if anyones way, we want to be out of their way, its their way. Where there is no results or an evaluation and criticism of the systems that got us here there is also no advancement.

Lost in detached strains the individual that speaks as one subject an idle solitary line was never any issue, we needed to understand the very notion of subjectivity itself, and the historic thread now in which subjectivity speaks and established esthetics and the ideology of the imagination?!

One needs to know a thing or two about the systems and light some way through it to people and go way back again. out of this swamp, wasteland, this all a canundrum of “look for meaning and stipulate no meaning”, this analysis looking at a meaning laying there still, standing there letting it scream while it is dying, rather then an oration to carry that meaning on ones own back and carry it along a distance on your own… educate yourself and consider nothing worth educating about, this crisis, Foucault was right. regression is only way its all running in circles now.

When we are deconstructive we fall back to the powerlesness as an individual.
When we find that constructive cause we see there is no use or purpose to modern society and it will collapse.
Then revolution when the powers that be now crumble in their old relics built in another time.
They are ritual vacuosities.
Art has long taken other course, and here we say if the word atheism is just a word and does n’t mean anything then satanists are in fact satanists. Then religious people are just artists, as far as they build cathedrals. We should strive for anyone to conspire to the debate for the sake of debate to become ever more the zombie that he is, that they are.
"TO Paris Hilton. WHy don't you sell all the Hiltons and buy gold and all the skyscrapers in Brussels, and have golden angels on the skyscrapers and art deco towers replacing those shitty modern towers, and have all girls who bought your perfume live there for free, then sell your house and your clothes, keep the sword you modelled with, and i can sculpt you a throne with 50 and 50 angels in gold, on either side against a 20 metre tall marble plate for your throne. And i can build a palace Angh around it."

As everyone goes around in circles in their own brain as everything IS subjective finally then i go in circles in my own brain where i clearly started just now and you can go in circles in your own brain?! Or you could consider i once wanted to destroy myself because i found everything was like the world around me considered and said? How about i DID destroy my own mind with the paradox of subjectivity. And then saw Michel Foucault reading exactly the same books going to exactly the OPPOSITE conclusion?? I went to psychiatry said if everything is subjective you do not get out i said "all this interior is insanity" and then i read the theory of relativity so many years later and a white dove came to my window? I stripped the modernist wall paper and there were golden palms under it? Enough? Want 300 more such effects? Matter and electricity clearly coincided as Jungs theory of catalytic exteriorisation effects goes and that as much i would have never believed, neither would you if its not a FACT now. Alas, that needs not to mean anything. For someone to finally have the nerve to say though. WHERE is it, that its a story, and WHERE is it, that is the meaning of it? Clearly we can see the meaning has been lost in life, the reservation has gone in advertising. In fiction there is high romantic realism but certainly no elegance or classical pride of tragedy and will to motivate one to a faith more attached to ones real life. We have a segragation always of time, past and now, futuristic development of minimalism, we have a detachment of how we live, eat chips in front of a screen or chat all day, and adventure and games. The celebration of essential resources and deification of that would lead to less consumption obviously. Or any theory wortwhile would be against the rudimentary in design and hence be artisan. Hence be uncommercial. We can form this eventually in some extreme leasure or tourist camp, commodify all life. Somewhere there is a restriction, beauty is subjective, yet there is none more general concern then providing basics and sticking a poster against the wall depicting some castle or dark music star. Surely matter comes in all forms of allegories? Why then is nihilism and beside that conceptual art and minimalism prevelant? In any case you need to crawl into a worthwhile armed forest now, there are no restrictions on industrial powers?? What i mean is, there is no hardening, wearing and tearing anymore. There is freedom, but it is decided for some reason now that the quirky science fiction story -ahhh a modern reference there will not be many.- suddenly invented a instant zapped on your plate dish, and the people in that fiction story had decided, we should eat nothing but bear atoms, we should eat a grey sordid goo?! “nothing else is real” they would say. A 26 year old female milking a cow? A VIRGIN for that matter? Milking a cow. That is somehow unreal? Unfathomable? Dismissed into history? Not of our time? What the hell do you want me to write poetry about? Smartphones? Okay this is toooooo phallic for your modern notioN. OKAY, how about twenty virgins managing a 19th century windmill and baking bread? We could easily make them immortal, seal them behind a glass wall and put them there as an artwork, ideal beauty then… exists. Some notions of modern reality would allow beauty or any classical reality allows modernism to be integrated and you can integrate the classics into modern shells and start over but you can’t just stack concrete and asphalt and stand in a traffic jam and consider no composition? The whole composition is way overdeu for evaluation.
What followed was that i deduced artisan reality is communication over beauty (which happens to be treu if you ask international heritage foundation) but this artisan has no time, THERE IS NO TIME, so artisan crafting and building churches to the IMAGINATION is an entirely democratic way to assert truth and beauty and cultural renaissence. I rest my case. I have a 7000 page manifest. So no reason not to pick it up. Its all surely a waste if i have to explain it in an introduction post. But its all tied together, whats more, i am a unique individual in that i’m no longer here, i’m no longer part of this time. Just like a nineteenth century system, which invented your modern atheism industrialism consumption and minimalism and everything else anyway. So. Truth is always dictated. Because: "Reality" is "not subjective".; is not how the standard and accepted theorums go are they?? Besides reality is abused by the civil class today. An insane person does not belong in their reality. So to an insane person reality is just merely what the normals tell them it is. Other then that a briljant mind might simply not condone the reality as it is and live in a better, more composed, and consider a composition more aligned to a future ideology.
The standard aqcuisitions is indeed that reality is an object to each a subject and we don't know what is behind that. Trace it back thats what started Marxism, minimalism, antiestheticism, modernism and so many other things sooo. "reality is but a word to assertain ALL that is known and so far we only know and we only apply our knowledge to what we can or must create and we can and must have for ideals the rest of reality CAN not be known to my understanding. (Science can come up with an allegory, temporarily even then, of what reality seems to be doing, other then that imagination or personality is all deemed insane to science. Excessive character, extravagance, excentricity, decoration, a nuancation of the very basic always becomes an abberent thing, consider how our language evolved. From everything coiling in decorative circles its noa a slick exclamation point. “THIS IS IT”. How can we ever entertain such notions? Each consideration of past genius is considered insane or conceptualized as “surpassed” -for the sake of?- this what we have now? Its somehow all surpassed, people hurry that notion, they have no other notion then the bare innovation, which is, easily and will also be surpassed. (not then some classic beauty considered by some.) The surpassed is surpassed as the modern is now post modern, we might as well call the surpassed then post surpassed equivalent to that? We will call the classics preclassics now? It does n’t do anything it just nothing no words to work with then the “new” and if it was not “new” it would not be the superbly innovative which it was acclaimed to be. We communicate only what is material for us. We have considered everything is subjective and we have created a society for subjects who have no real opinions as only the general subject is real. And we have done that the past 200 years. Skyscrapers, fiction, key on the door mansions, this hive they built is what we will treat of, and the fantasy as kitsh underground and shining from the fiction cities, fictions fantasy and esthetics radiators and fiction hypnosis. It can hardly be called a reality.
Rather we will find business suits and jogging pants are now fiction.
If this manifest is real and solid.
Science is another matter i'm not sure what science is, at least it IS the opposite of the imagination myeah that would figure. Besides we would n't think you can understand quantummechanics with logic i.e syllogism or theory of relativity for that, so you must understand it with imagination, therrrre they seem to have lost with the simple "there is no god, there is yes god" system, the imagination or allegory simply doesn't have that problem. Things can be identified by spirituality, and don't need to count for those that do not believe it, its not a matter of belief either way its just a presentation of fiction. Of which can be obserbed in all its luxureous and awesome facets. AND will be taken seriously considering how elegant, serene, majestic, beautiful, might, expression,...etc it has. Superman wearing underpants above trousers or superman being very aligned and mighty evolving IS important to the DEGREE of seriousness therefore the validity of imagination wisdom and how a deity is installed. (notice again as we seem to conclude this “object” behind a subject” is a total farce.) Faith is therefore the absolute awe of imagination as abstraction and the providence of reality somehow, as it created you and as you would have touched upon imagination even if you died or were ejected among the living even for a brief second you get recognized. This is entirely reasonable. As supersition is entirely different and the side effect of subjects discovering all kinds of faiths, which are merely artistic considerations. (Some of which practicioners i may like or dislike their methods but have yet to have found me once not inquiring who what and why and wondering as i first and foremost consider it art and secondary can always debate on these matters. Truth is nothing applies to me in a very strange way.) Some rhetorics and tragedy also may be included. And inspiration is TRUTH, so one is always free, imagination is the way to inspiration, inspiration is again the way to more imagination, inspiration is a passage. There are; since reality works and is a clockwork mechanical only; two things, lies and very beautiful lies. As we need to create, we do not accept a terminal solution simply, as we would start to create the same thing over and over again. We come to the solution that all allegories matter in matter. Schopenhauer can be turned into an allegory, as much as Aphrodite or whomever, to concentrate on one point is cultish is n’t it? And they have, they run it all over the world?? Most people have as yet to realize their more serious and melancholic facets because they are still high on cartoons and this ironic hysteria, developed we would say from the Surrealist “prophets” by any means we do not consider anyone who has influence as other then a prophet, even if he would consider himself as an atheist or a fiction writer. We have prophecy or degenerate prophecy here, not anything else. Aphrodite is therefore evenly worthy in allegoric value as the nothing or the mould we are on the earth. At no point is modern society a solid construct that can evolve and operate a fashion onwards with the clockwork. It is the new perpetually innovating only to create the same monstrocities eventually making the clock spin in circles, and explodes, this is, along with this hive, and this underground now outrageous, not at all unlike we wanted it, as now we can rise up and this power vacuum has us simply as artists, recreate the world as we see fit. We gather the courts the cosplayers and place our designs and technology there. After 50 years of ever more and ongoing and increasing waste and stupidity and driving in circles. We who know yes, that society has a history, and has also to us a future, to the ordinary mind, he just exists in these seconds, to the policians, there is no time but this circular mainstream verneer laying over arts and beauty everywhere. The intelligence and old audience of classical books can no longer be spoken to. The classic genius can no longer be commercially accepted. If you utter a profound vision against commerce of course it would not be commercial, therefore we must gather here, and make our own courts and salons and senates. We consider then this work is an evaluation and psychology of the structure, evaluating the past 200 years, considering its development of space initiatives reasonable confused and obscured by a lack of leadership and somehow, it all went crazy. The considerations of spacetravel are dialectic in time we can see, how people built biospheres and modern spaceships on earth. How the imagination did n't propagate but rather mystified space travel. If we analyze not just 20 or 50 years but 200, we can then actually grasp, and not just reshovel modern reality, and can only then come to profound insights on beauty, kitsh and technology, or the value and worth of it. Standing as a modernist among modernists finally has not a single use anymore. Communication will simply abort as the decay over 200 years has everything aborted. The first time warning you then however. This is by no means conservative or progressive. It is not left or right and it is extremely left AND right. I consider God is more corrupt then most people today -who want modesty- but that is exactly what i liked about the man. First of all I have no opinion to sell other then to people who already had a hard time today and just find this to strengthen their own ideals, i do not write for self assured modernists, trolls, civil people, tidy people, family people etc. I don’t see how there is anything here to doubt or debate?! It is merely the construct of a new genius, so declared and confirmed indeed a genius “scientifically” by the way, after he was shoved under everything with a little pill and the rhetorical question “now you want a normal life right?” maybe they should have let me answer that question. And actually should have listened. I don’t write this to be made into a moral indignation for my person. Yes i’m a hypersensualist and an esthetician born in modernism and the anguish of the deep pit, loneliness and being scoffed all my life how can i be anything else? I considered murder, armed revolt against average citizens, i considered just about any depravity etc. New depravities which the marquis De Sade did n’t even consider. I’m by no means even as corrupt as him?! I had platonic relationships, one with an anorexic in psychiatry. This usual i want to fuck and i need a bitch and how that goes these days is n’t my style at all?! I’m still warming up writing poems about breast development. Which are not illegal but should provoke what i consider a serious amount of a deranged and utterly degenerated mankind, degenerated in that it got to believe the advertisements, and never looked for the depraved passions or possibly passionate turmoils of the soul or the excentricities of love and sensuality, reverie and lust and sentimentality. Which it somehow was spilled out of, now it claims its heinous despairs and frustrations must be spewed over various brilliance and provocative merit?? They can have whatever ghetto they have left, whatever empty shell of a culture they have left. Hence it is not an opinion, but a resolution, a manifest to those who need it. It could be but a provocation only to those I could annoy or agrevate. It does n’t have to be a vestige of the truth against or in the face of their nihilism or their ugly faces when they blow steam from their nostrils. I made a few manifests, i opened the eyes of Hethred at the beginning of this site? One reason to stay away? I will give you many more reasons to stay away. Because i will always have a degree perhaps MORE nervewrecked then they could agrevate me, to aggrevate them more then they could aggrevate me?! This of which is hardly possible for a generous and sensitive person as myself to establish. Thick hard spiked hearts i can't easily beat them. So i flee here, enter a more frail and estheticly inclined domain!! And if this site does rise up, insulated from all these screams and opinions. I rather prefer a desert. Preferably with an anorexic or two. If I ever be Christ to someone, which i certainly hold for possible, and which is certainly desirable, then i would prefer a desert over the crusifixion of modern age, and with it a desert from its dialogue debate and sense of reasonability. None the less, i have seen a certain problem clearly. I have stumbled upon it at 21 i believe i was. In great solitude. Now i have no, no peace in a forest or a desert. You are just consuming it all. With your casual all owh this is going well, with your casual owh small steps, owh small virtues. If you say to every intelligent person he just has an opinion and should sit in a forest or a desert and leave the world to the democracy? Excuse me? Yes excuse me, very much so?! I did n’t want to be part of it. We will see then in all coming storms, if I also have the last word. Then i can rest in peace when the hysteria, the despair, the frustration, and the inmeasurable arrogance of various stupid peoples around, will be smoked in that last word. Then again, i only have peace when i DO have the last word, at no point do i want a hysterical, dumbfounded, stupendous, sewer of a society and anyone who does not literally rise up for the fight against it have the last word. Then i will not have peace.



First verse of the Bible II

I KNOW NO OTHER SOCIAL INTERACTION THEN TO INSTILL IN DEEPEST SADNESS, OR TO SEE THE WORLD WITH DECREPID PERVERTED HATE, BUT ALL THAT WOULD STILL BE A SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH YOU. IF IT WAS NT FOR THE REVENGE THAT I WILL, IF NOT YOU GREET ME WITH KINDNESS OR SADNESS, SEE YOU IN THE WEEPING AND WANING BELOW HELL OF DESPAIR, AND YOU ARE NOT IMPRESSED. IN A GARDEN OF TRIVIAL PLEASURES, YOU ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY ANYTHING?! SO GRAVE A SENSITIVE MIND, THAT HE WILL THINK TRIVIAL SOCIETIES AND YOUR STUPID REASON AND YOUR STUPID IRONY, TO A MORBID ENSLAVEMENT, THAT YOU HAVE NO MORE NAIL CLIPPERS, BUT BRICKS FOR TEMPLES AND CASTLES TO STACK.

PS
To any young woman, i am still not married, NOW, i can state uniquivocally that, i invented the notion "love needs not to be consumed." if i already knew that before i met a girl that refused me, but had already proven that with a girl far more irresistable and considerate and kind, then you will know my name was "emo" and "angel" long ago. I can be perpetually friends with you, you can be perpetually lesbian, all i need is "love and freedom". Sex or strife or bullshit considering who i am and my impotance frailty and severe taste for important philosophy is not what i will have nor tolerate nor is what i have found in anyone before. In the notion that there is indeed a girl that would fight with me FIRST and has me do dishes later, wonders on this surface LOST and NOT smother any chance of lasting romance to idle domestication, and girls usual material snobbery and futility, and the whole attitude that comes with that. I will stay forever alone, yours truly.
"Tristhithea De Egrevheii"
I will remain equal to the frail, not a slave to the demanding, in that i have no equal, in that i am everyones slave usually, but prefer to be left for that, alone, and entirely seek refuge in and on my own discretions.
I dedicate this manifest also to any female lover of a possible Christ, also probably going by the cherishname of "eskimo pussy" or possibly a lot of "Eskimo pussies".
Ideally and to the privilage of my subjective opinion i choose NOT two of two things. ONE muse, which is infinatly frustrating, NOR a thousand whores, which is equally infinatly frustratinG.
I CHOOSE thousands or any number of muses, and NO WHORES, if have ONE that is not a whore and not demanding all kinds of nonsense but can sit quiet and knit a bit or whatever i'm fine. Its not too hard and not too hard to find either.
Our marriage contract in any way will NOT have any part in societal convention as that marriage indeed can not be certified by any state or any religion. But it WILL be a beautiful poem for YOU with QUITE an artistic value, you can even sell it and buy yourself a luxurious palace, it would be nice if i was if i was allowed just to walk around in it and also enjoy a roof over my head, it is NOT demanded, but SERIOUSLY.
Just it was your own subjective opinion now to understand what is FREE and what is PRICELESs, i have no interest in changing your mind, think of those things and decide on those things yourself. You already KNOW who you are, other then that any of the words here said were just air before the dazzled, and huney for the bees. If you are a dazzled person and you say huney here, i assure you its AIR, so no need for the dazzled to START STINGING ME WITH THEIR POINTY FINGERS, if you are bee and see air here; I ASSURE YOU ITS HUNEY!! So let me then rip your genitals out or whatever i'm supposed to do. Its not clear to me actually. I never know what to do.
I DONT ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING!
And clearly not even that.
Simply said, if you think you are superior in a domestic situation, then that always ends up with you pulling my hair and i could sincerely and rightfully bash your face up. EXCEPT i never DID THAT, RIGHTFULLY YES, BUT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT TOLERATED, I CHOOSE TO HAVE NONE OF YOU IN MY HOUSE. As far as running the world, any beautiful woman or millions for sure could run the world, so go at it. I offer you this site for it. Then you don't get so eager trying to fight in my household and you can be occupied in your own stupid affairs and do what should concern you more in the first place.
They asked me if my muses were things, ideas, or people.
funny but somehow so far they were all of the above, things, as they clearly were ill defined, ideas, as they were illusive and mysterious and people, as they were too human for me
ONE shieldmaiden, 14 in love 15 engaged to be married and at 16 unrecognizable and lost to me as to anyone. SO, if i was her i would have just got married in my ritual i composed and visited me in psychiatry accepted me coming drunk at the wedding, would have been a real pussy exchanging swords with me as i was her and attacked some cars and i'd be AT ONE and INFINATLY strong. But then again i'm not HER and then again I AM A MAN, always a girl, and SHE is a woman, ALWAYS a woman, and NOT by any means even remotely close in ambitions, nor equal or at the same odds of procreation and love and compassion in mind or in body.
Drink from me you precious concubine my body is my wound and my words are my blood.
I drink A DROPLET of a virgins blood, never greedy or at all hysterical for it, and no body but souls will i ever wound, leaving screams always behind me, but even as their souls i can crush, to scream or sit idle by and come back to scream or sit idle by is something they know always assured of, and hence never worried much dispite their shaken souls. Broozed strangled or broken, yet as their flesh; alive. Not did they thank me yet for being alive, indeed can they thank me some day for their souls.
And you Joan of DArkness!!
well i always carried your spirit and i looked for you, i could not figure what it would end up in but this reality we have now is as solid as the past and the future. My solitude once, my legions surely mobilized soon. From the world of tripe, looking for the lost recluse, the beached and wrecked, the lonely platoons, the havoc soldiers, the assasin templars, the killers of the shoppers, the skelleton who thinks i'm smart, and the artists who see me as their long lost brother, returned, a spirit as that i am and now you can be aware to carry also like i carried you always and will from now on, soul turned matter, yearning turned into flesh and bones, a saussage like your body in a latex condom, Or otherwise know as the most brutal heart in all imagination and beyond!!!

Some Entirely Self Indulgent remarks.
"The Super crystaline Moon Verse"
"My favorite quality i bestowed man is his love... For the arts. Never daunted for it, ever to wonder, a gaze deeper then any ocean, a counsciouss in it more vast then any universe. In it he communicates beauty, as it projects of an infinity of eyes whispering an infinity of voices, and in communicating beauty he loves himself, and is not self love, and that means to be high proud and glorious the ultimate feature, more diabolical then any weapon, a pride to defy or smile as you were slayen by that weapon. To wallow in defeat yes, to grimas still of anxiety trembling when you rot in humiliation, perpetually looking up, cascades of defeat can never wore you, in it then he is not alone, as selflove, is self worth, and self worth, is the value in which anyone will be traded for. "

The Silver MOon Verse.
-"Satan without his sword, or for that matter myself without a sword, too funny as none angels would dare not laught at this a joke, and to you a joke," -"and this world entirely your amuse, could i then if not Satan as i be? Rid the world of your spewing ironies turning the earth decrepid a reign as a yoke."

The Absinth Moon Verse.
"Despairs for deepest wrath thay caught me in so much darkness as a black hole vapor draped in black tears so wet"
"Had evolution not granted me these two eyes "
"Without the sight of any light and even then that so much sight a lessed!"
"As in this oblivion only deadened hearts now cries!"
"For any panthers here playing as flowers in a swans disguise!"
"On none then a crusified butterfly may nature have at its behest."
"Or a braver, glorious, dutyiful, and esteemed gift trapped among societies lies."
Let the victims of society be with more furious and nobler signs one day be again blessed."
to hell may the devil be, indeed where you are trapped with him and as he flew once and still meanders and eloquently there flies.
"As anyone should equally and always be bold to state so with their every wits and smart magnificent talents only a robe to your most beautifully and woke and brazen bittered heart
To note that in existence there is nothing to mock but that its a friendly companion of death, entirely, a child its softest and most sincere art."
To blatantly and mercylessly mock this omnipotent and illusive and alike a young maiden a mysterious existence is to shout aloud.
That none but your desolation caught,
and none of you a comfort
is in these dreaded and anguished parts allowed.
A crisis you have bought.
And so you did not of this crisis at all needed suffered.
When you eat or drink or sing.
Now then still.
That pagan realms here are king.
And religions stupor drunken from the dreams.
Left this reality frizzling at the seams
and finally had the end now a one reality as far as it was real
as a young newborn deer now as a kill
with a one golden arrow
prey to the devils under a devil this prey reality and its dream therein it is still...

The Blood Moon verse.
It would be assumed that all time universe and existence is meaningless and everyone gave up on the existentialists request to look for meaning, or consider the warning that others are hell?! But how would you contrive of a moment really? How would you describe any word to that? And how could you not see the heat coming from always one step nearer to that hell? Hell walked forward, a prophecy then, science could not resolve it, for how in hell could the be knowledge if you evolved from prophecy, how free will if you are attracted from the future and ever onwards. Destiny has no equal, its name is an ounce of milk, spilled upon a flower, a flower petal, drifting, on an ocean of milk, sweet destiny where did you wonder? Owh mighty universe how did you catch my soul her and now, without your graven material portals, i would be nowhere, and you that granted me awareness, may seem to myself that i am. A ghost so ominpotent, and a figment of my own imagintion so illusive. WHere you had not caught me. I would not exist, where i had free will. I rest now on laurels that as far as intuition is in the future, for a frail grasp among illuster purpose, that in the past also known is an intuition, that as you realized yourself, only then do you know yourself. And as you finally know yourself, only then will you see what you did. Leaf, in the gracefull realm of an ocean of milky intuition.

THe Opaline Moon Verse.
Owh majestic you a symmetry that you are at the other end of existence,
throughout electricity and omnipotence of an illusion,
to us mere an unfortune and a crime, chaos! A loss to us as an abode of this oblivion in which extince falls to its death!
Saw any eye upon beauty at all as an intrusion.
What a friend to be made in love, and a shrine and art made for its wasted flowery breath.
So certain as in sleep and psychosis blossom the ultimate woes,
and cancer never from these or any sorrow or death in haste or even at last beauty goes
as supreme quality of existence its cause and purpose and its goals here in you flows.

Romantic was also once identified as the smallest defying the overwhelming odds, like a candle light dinner, but it was purer in the nineteenth century, as everything is commercialized or trivialized in this age
how you are even apart of the world and NOT be apart of that world is at least a mystery, is in some realms at least catalyst of black metal as in where it got us and is in some realms at least wonderous where on earth these subjects who never heard of black metal keep coming from and what on earth they are going to dress up as next??
What more can you loose yourself in completely, in the authenticity with all to do with nature and these deities and characters, myths legends. If only we forget this giant heap of plastic, condoms and styrofome, carton board and bubble wrappings that mankind made and is so hysterical about? Are we not fit to loath as dark elves? Do we not have right in our malign? Do we truly devestate the planet? How many are there like us? Like was said to me just now? "how many care for classical beauty?" or as was said earlier weeks ago "Have you tried keeping it to yourself?" The fools want to party hard! So the dark elves hold their rites when the stench of mankind reaches their sensitive nostrils!! Is n't that then the greatest proof? Keep it to yourself, keep to smalltalk and drivle, is n't it the proof that mankind laughs and groans, barks and smirks in greatest hilarity over its little bubble, of which with few words we could tear it apart. But let us not do that. Would n't that be upsetting to the party of the retards?

"if you do not believe it, that is none of my business, I MYSELF believe it, and that is enough, your refutes or what you refute me with is each a meager and unfathomably small component of debate towards me and against ideas so vast that it makes you an infinate amount smaller then me. I BELIEVE THAT, IF I DO NOT OR SEE ANY MORE OF YOU, OR NOT HAVE CONSENT AND APROPRIATE FLATTERING FOR SUCH MARVEL, then i will read my lines a thousand times again and forget about "YOUR OPINION" and if it is not consent flattery or entirely ambitious new excitement for the future then i suggest you ALSO read it again a thousand times UNTILL you forgot YOUR OPINION, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with these statements and the proof of burden is still AGAIN on the existentialists perspective to concoct another stupidity or a disregard or an irony to reverse what i just said, and that for the disregard and vomit out all beauty or all creation AND YOU COULD NOT SWALLOW IT DOWN AS IT CAME AS A SLIZE OF PIZZA WITH CHEESE LIKE LEAD AND SALAMI LIKE HUNEY ON TOP OF THAT? MAKE ANOTHER MOVE, ITS YOUR TURN AGAIN, esteemed fellow politician. SEVEN BILLION politicians and SEVEN BILLION VOTERS, my voice and my vote i will throw that away. I just mean to rely on the merit of magnificence of the creation of THESE, anything else may be of distant remote orders or alien awareness, there IS NO CHOICE."

"this is an underground artists resistance radio broadcast, this is the artists military emergency and apocalyps broadcast system we appeal and call out to all artists who are not impoverished and or committed suicide and or destitute, ignored, in psychiatries, begging etc, and call them to arms for the perception war and create a unique ecological and artisan and sustainable society. We are not Utopists we simply want you to abort societies garbage stack and stop working in factories do it yourselves stores cinema's etc, just let it all crash and burn, then we recycle most cars into spacecraft as is proper and is the only way to survive, the idiots have lost, their reality is a nazistic propaganda genius comitting genocide on fish feelings and anything remotely considered beautiful or worthwhile. We repeat, where you are, this is an emergency broadcast, do not conspire to modern reality. ABORT"
"A prophets job AND his doubt both ends and begins, where he has had another one to listen, but there the job of anyone who listen to the prophet ends and also begins again."

Now the time space and causality of anything that you need to know about my childhood nor perversions i DO NOT care NOR do i have a candidature for your gossip pages EVER, but ONE thing will you understand i CAME UP WITH THIS ALL for a WHITE DOVE COming to my window and living with me for three years. I DO NOT OR ALSO come up with all of this OUT OF MY ASS so to speak to speak the language of all you rotten existentialists EVEN IF LITERALLY PRACTICALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUST BE AN ASSHOLE OUT OF THE BLEU IF YOU WERE NT BORN ONE, AS IT ALL INDEED DOES CONTEST OF A PRAcTICAL FACT? NOW THAT MEANS and by ALL MEANS I ALsO HAVE RIGHTS, i can not get it published or NONE would MOBILIZE POSSIBLE TO FIGHT ALONE FOR THIS CAUSE THEN??? BUT NONE THE LESS AS A POEM I CAN JUST WRITE IT IS AS I SAY IT GOES, OR IT GOES NOWHERE? AND IT GOES, AS IT GOES, IF YOU SAT THERE DROOLING MOVE OUT OF THE FUCKING WAY AND LEAVE ME THE FUcK ALONE. IF THERE IS ANYONE SPIRITUAL OR SINCERE AT ALL YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS WORLD DOES NOT WORK, IT IS WITHOUT VALUE. AND IF YOU BELIEVED THERE WAS DESPAIR?! THEN DO NOT LOOK AT THE DESPAIRED THE DEAD THE SUICIDAL OR THE SKELETONS, LOOK AT THOSE WHO HAVE FUN?! IN ANY CASE THERE IS PURITY ANd INTUITION, OR THERE IS CANCER AND DEVESTATION, I KNOW AND HAVE SEEN INTUTION, PURITY, ANd I KNOW AND HAVE SEEN CANCER AND DEVESTATION!!

Well behold now what is clearly the DUMBEST society ever devised, they believe in NOTHING, and indeed make no BEAUTIFUL matter or consideration prime nor even be remotely CONSIDERED, they AGREE on that and this makes the existential crisis of the market and makes the debilitation and existential crisis of all the authors and advertisements, and the policians the LEADERS god forbid have NO other creed then suffice that self destructive market. And THIS society believed that what christ said that he who is poor will be the first person to heaven IS A LIE?? It is not only contrary to that a mathematical fact, it is the only antidote and leadership in a time of total hysteria, if they said peoples brains don't mature very fast then surely everyone stacked with LED showers and LED cookers in stead of going back to an old thrown away KETTLE or even the notion to drink everything COLD if it would only help you to SURVIVE, and not consider you all invented and are capable of FIRE for YOURSELF as a SUBJECT YOU CAN GET IT IM SURE, we can always find out, TO TAKE FIRE to survive you are used to that; but for sure there not many advertisements or prophets today telling you TO LEAVE THE FIRE to survive and i'm afraid that is ALL That was necessary, try establish the meaning and stock value of this society THEN?!

"To be blessed with many muses, but the notice that it would leave you completely wrecked. Which is the essence of reality, love or misery, i can not nor have ever decided then yet other then both accounts are in me, to aim very high, be dazzled, and fling myself at staggering depths alike. But don't take that for granted. A staggering high aim and a dazzling depth may be the same to a pizza gubbler and a philosopher, what though then would be the meaning of words? If not to eat was in ones heart? And if not to know was in ones heart as well. If eating was in your heart. I surely would hate to see you mess up a painting of a Goddess. If knowing was in your heart. I sure hate to see you having to eat the cadavre of your own Goddess."

"Why did you create a problem, that you were unable to get out of in the first place? But it was resolved somehow."
"The evidenntial must be spelled out to people, so much of what i say people say "owh i already know that" "owh they are already doing that" etc. is very frustrating, well, since others don't know that and you did n't know as it was n't spelled out yet and IF what i say would be spelled out for everyone maybe they would n't make this society such a big mistake, and they would n't just sit idle buy reading the advertisements, maybe if you agreed or discarded the masses for what they are, you would n't just act like the masses anymore then. Maybe if i'm done with the masses, there would n't be any masses left, so far though. Not so well yet."
~~~
THE SUBJECTIVE Well defined by Kant its "each an object to one a subject and we can not know what is the thing in itself" but defined by me it becomes a circular loophole not being able to state what you think is beautiful and evolving in the shapeless, formless, odourless, imagination pulp of fiction and virtual reality and minimalism and mass degeneration as marxism as unbrideled capitalism individualist hysteria and a materialism of trivialities and above all, it juxtaposes the "artisan history" opposed to the "technological novelty" which is a no way street. Progress optimism the french revolution democracy and technology as minimalism in architecture, conceptual art and abstraction all came from this "a subject knows no object as he can't identifty it with another subject." Ironically it created another society. Which was always to be a complete and utter paradox.
~~~
"An artist as a craftsman, of words or worlds, may write himself as a Christ or Satan alike, that of which will appear is his weight, and dispite Christ or Satan, more even then that, as i know that is my weight. But of that you will know. NOT that everything is "subjective" but that that means you are a craftsman of words and worlds, of which you may write yourself as Christ or Satan alike, because that must appear your weight. IF you are a subject, so then you are NOT a subject."

"The word is indeed that most people are "subjected" "ruled" by something other then themselves. A word entirely unfortunate. But they chose it, and so they went for it. So then subjects are from Kant, Communists are from Marx and Kant. If i set you free, then perhaps to exclude myself, as i was n't any self among subjects, but that i consider i had a sign to teach me to write. Then that sign is significance, and if you were not emancipated, and needed a religion, then that you could be emancipated. But that you could n't be apparently? Without that a sign. I don't need that sign now, so consider me an atheist, but for the significance of emancipating you, someone will indeed need to signify something to arise mankind from this wasteland, of which any artist and philosopher that truly studied the age, could see the rubble that was stacked by the past 200 years philosophers, and was the essence that birthed this society."

"When nothing has changed, you know that 1 and infinity, and an Eden enclosed or a universe, you know that now and finally there is only inspiration, and then you will know everything, and suffice in hope to create some more days and lives."

"If it is a science what is in here, or if you can deduce a science out of it, then the world, will as yet have a dramatic twist, and then it can survive, but if everything is just personal drivle, which according to quantummechanics can indeed BOTH be treu, then i can consider Immanuel Kant and Poe as Baudelaire and Schopenhauer as much as Nietzsche Sade, or Hitler or Jean Delville or Reagen and so many others as PROPHETS, and then I am one of these PROPHETS, both can be treu as there can be LESSON AND INSPIRATION at the same time?! Means that you have to derive of something to know something, and you have to -in the same time- know freedom to GO somewhere?! How on earth that happens is absolutely counter intuitive and paradoxical. But the fact of the matter remains that this world in one fell swoop is one whole from the past, as it is another whole if you start DOING SOMETHING with it. The marxian Hegelian and Schopenhauerian and Nietzschean and Einsteiniean presumptions then alll cave in with the same notion also. Well if it was n't going to be pretty profound, apocalptic even, a shattering notion, then it would n't be exactly scientific nor prophetic at all would it? See the air or the profondity in BOTH notions as you wish?! But analysis and formula to sustain this whole concept are plentyfull. But with my mind as quantummechanics i would already have destroyed you, i could have personalized my own sense and life and reality into the stars or black holes and could have been considered a great man, but could have achieved absolutely nothing with it. Untill after reading the theory of relativity a white dove appeared to me. And for that, i don't have to be a grand man, i can just be a simple poet, doing one simple thing, and that is to certify the skin of reality, which is not so much vacuous prophecy but evolution, as you always said, way before that, that i had no thoughts who you could get carried into to, just loozing track is all you could do. And any man or any mankind would, after all this society is naked and made empty and functional for a reason, it is a hive and a democratic billions of heads for a reason. But to make sense of YOU i could not, and YOU did not think you could make sense of ME. Though the thought that a dove is so much to SHIT, it does that on your roof perhaps, but entirely WHOLE a dove, shit AND feathers and wings and beak and brain and then even mind etc, came to my door, well i should n't be so presumptuous i could say OUR door as i don't really believe in property or domestic relations whatsoever. But that reality is shit and all should be functional and the overall notion that there is nothing does NOT exist to me. It DOES NOT HAVE TO exist to me. If you bring it up i will naturally resent it as much as you SHOULD but NEEDED to resent and it NEEDED an answer, so there you go. Science to think you to NOWHERE and a prophet WITH dove this time to get you OUT, simple, naive, kitshy, entirely plausable, but NOT a CHEAP feat of hocus pocus AT ALL. Considering right now you all have NOTHING, i just need to write all my beautiful architecture, FOR YOU, and YOU will then think the white dove does but SHIT and I OWN THE BUILDING, and i but imagine YOUR WORLD and consider NO, the WHITE DOVE DOES NOT DO BUT SHIT? AND THAT IS NOT THE ESSENCE OF LIFE, whatever which was n't totally obvious, but needed a white dove for me to ring through in this age and this age with THIS philosophy, and THAT amount of "reality" as quantummechanics, well good luck in building a nice building for the imagination with that one. I am waiting. I am an architect or for that matter a conceptual artist with an evil before hand, a concept after the facts, i can verify my shit fine as any conceptual artist, my world is slightly bigger, and i have as much to describe a fantastic and equally religious world as scientology or psychiatry etc. BE THEY AS THEY MAY, i differ on this seconds and arts to have seconds of life to be treu. If psychiatry or its patients, or for that matter scientology and its teachings will ever be examined and edited to profound meaning it will be by some notion of intelligence and perhaps some "politics". Simply not listen like psychiatry does or simply have nothing on earth to centralize and consider is not dangerous for myself, its more dangerous to them. I'm fine, and besides, i do call myself on emails more an ELF then an ALIEN. Just a matter of ESTHETIC and PAGAN awareness. But at the other side of reality, or from where i could come? Well reason can do more things then just slap bananas out of a tree you know. You should TRY IT!!"

"If there was never one to liberate the masses? Then religion would have led us here. At a different point but none the less we could have done without?! So let me ask you? If someone liberated the masses? How could the masses ever be liberated? And if you have a subject? How could that subject ever be part of the masses? The only truth is self indulgence, and if it is truth? Then the self indulgent must be seperate, and if one would now be seperate, the one would choose to be slightly self indulgent?! Be that as someone might amuse himself in other things, when the masses usually confirm glaring at eachother, exhausting the teaching, and confirming to a "reality" which does n't appear to be one at close examination. In this treatize you will find all of the above. Self indulgence, originality, lack of conformity, and the reality breaking away from an exahausted "reality" which on close examination did n't appear to be one."

"What languages or schizophrenia or deities may once be, if we see what they did, then we can but exalt in the religion that we are NOT doing that, and THAT is the language that is the truth and with which to speak, to see to what they did. Any other religion is abberent."

"The greatest moral of conservatives is that we should return. The greatest moral of this as a manifest and what is identified as "regression" is that we are already returned, others can do as they wish. But it is inescapable a consideration of esthetics. We can not just, "stick things all over it" we say that modernism is indeed a detriment. The greatest morality of progressives and of modernism in essence is the paradox that "to each their own" which essentially needs to be "nothing" as anything else would be fascistic. None the less modernism was formulated by a mere few people and built by a mere few people, and the author of this manifest is not keen on consensus or blind adherence at all. But a notion and that everyone would need a notion of this is indeed inevitable, as much as then fascism is as much consderable as communism is, at long last we are not left or right, we are not king nor pleb."

"Modernism must make all decorative features of aristocratic emancipation and art into some fascistiod dream world that must not be emancipated, yes take the artists from their clouds on one hand where it conserns the free market, and kill them where it conserns progressives, then at the very end both sides capitalism and communism must consider we have a final result a "ghetto" or what is considered "multiculturalism" or "multiculturalism" which finally ends up into one big "ghetto". Finally we say build neigbourhoods into palaces and adopt any allegory at your own free will. And these plebeians will not be so frustrated. HOW you got into this modern philosophy need n't be at all so blatantly paradoxical, and me getting you out of it would n't need to be so blatantly paradoxical either."
"Archsymbolism, the notion that the imagination, when indeed projected as serene, is holy, and when indeed projected as beauty, is apart of ecology, and has in it the key to the completed artwork of the earth."

"This time is like a mass of walking cans of perforated diarrhea spouting out their contents everywhere, because for twohundred years no one ever got to any substance to build people, to educate people. There are a few things that the suicidal and the frail, the anorexics and amok runners, mainly, would need to know; to keep it together; They will need to absorb a few things. There are poets who don't know what words mean anymore, philosophers lost in subjectivity paradoxes. Well for them this is written. For any classical mind, it will not be easy to build it up again. but we did build things up again here, so its a fresh start. We needed to get this through a machine especially programmed to find you as obviously when you write down the words melancholy or art or beauty and so many classical references its not bound to be very commercial. The masses regurgitating their own vomit again never interested or never was a concern to us anyway, that that vomit is on top of everything now and there seems no solution for it is problematic. Here apart from a fresh start is also something solid, rather then conceptualizing history like modernism does we open a gate to it again. That should emancipate personalities not kill people into being a mere subject with their own opinion to be lost among the abstract industrial machine.

This does n't have to be some vague or solipsistic theory or a theory part of the solipsism, in fact its a critique of subjectivity. No realization of beauty or meaning can be established without first a critique on subjectivity. In fact it was a problem the MAIN problem even that created modernism. If anyone sells you spirituality or anything now they clearly did n't see the problem. We are here to get to the bottom of modern esthetics, because the philosophy resulted in a society and the society in its turn is nothing but an esthetic commune.

"To emancipate matter and art, we adhere only to the highest purpose for things and for ourselves" We DO NOT want no conceptual church full of rubbish we are all symbolists now, pluralists, that is imagination falling apart in a plurality of allegories, with only SERENITY for composition of what we would find as beauty and deity, as it would be serious, and so we WILL make religious art in EVERY possible concept of its beauty and use ANY "faerytale" at our disposal, to Churches HIGHER then any before, as they would be imagination temples or imagination cathedrals. They will be HIGHER then the dogmas, as we also know that; "truth is inspiration"."

"So other then that, Immanuel kant was wrong considering we do not know the object, as always there is mass coherence, if i would state how i love this or that beauty, and everyone else always anwsers me with "everything is subjective" except for artists or otherwise classicaly scholared people, who would have it in themselves to form constructive debates on that matter, you would consider there IS such a thing as the masses, and the mass coherence of modern people. THat what those who defend beauty would be subjective is then absurd and sickening. If THEN those mass coherent people constantly bicker that everything HAS to be so damn subjective, it is no wonder that we revert to the grand sceam of things and the whole of modernism and its foundation to contest that when it proposes it as a fact and if it proposes there is such a thing as a "pluralism for all""

"In any given case you have TWO ways you can be resented, to be in effect part of the modernist sect of being a "distinguished normal human being" or to be "an artist of your own thought", the first one which is a sect and will always be part of dogmatics, apparently so now very much, and an artist of which deu to his nature not being part of the distinguished normal human beings has to fight demons and then be parasited on by those who dispise him. It could be first and foremost a notable luxury and treat then the RIGHT for the artist, for the Christ(s) to dispise the masses. In which they would be satan(s), but benevolent or malign leaders none the less, and prophets they will always be."

"Considering "Christ" and "Christians" nor Satan and Satanists for that matter are the same, there can not be justice, and morality is perpetually schewed. But more then a politician or a leader that "takes" or not "takes" it is effective only where shit gets straightened out in the wider picture and on the longer term, if that does n't happen no proclaimed "justice" and "sincerity" whatever that all may be will lead anywhere anyway. Whereby my position is only too clear that whoever has wealth should not sustain from artisan opulance which only employs artists and does n't feed anyone, but artists then, who now work in do it yourself and other useless supply stores for the masses, and their opulance is farcical. Equally i see any moral depravity as a mere myth the masses always do with what they do best, would they have not commited mass suicide if they did n't have their only solace? GOSSIP. And which latter can be opposite to the moral fibre of intelligent discourse as the backstabbing of equal man with the hypocrisy of identification with it in the first place. If you would give so much credit to yourself, you need not be innocent to cast the first stone, why don't you look away in the first place, if you were such an indivual, no you had to be part of the discourse."

"In this modern age you can get thought a very conservative stance which denies or does n't include the modern "romantic" stance
this "romantic" stance then though did n't emancipate actually it just let the masses grow tedious and banal and gutted the exeptional from society as some kind of disease
The avant garde stance dancing around society always got naturally selected out of it, as it never put its foot down."

"The notion that society displaced 40 to 60 percent of technology and progress is a legitimate analysis and concept, but go explain that to the commercial press?! To the newspapers? Go make an advertisement out of that? So what goes for me that that is an opinion on the grounds of analysis, it goes for this "subjective" culture as it evaluates each subjects worth for some reason or other. I know that for twenty years???? They refuse to publish it or give it any rumor? EvEN BEFORE post truth let alone AFTER??? Now its anyones geuss if its true. You can analyse jettonize the whole civilisation into space and leave NONE on the earth and still some people will consider the earth is flat FROM NOW ON???" I'm NOT even a fundamentalist "round earther" I mean all things considering, it could all be forged etc, thats very much possible. Nothing on the internet can't be trusted etc, horizon theories etc could all be fit for interpretation etc etc. But if you analyze the mainstream perspective and trace it back some time SURELY we can see the expansion of the structure? SURELY Egyptian, Biblical, Greek, Roman, New Testamentical, Medieval, Renaissensistic, Manneristic, Baroque, Rococo, and romanticism and classicism and both World Wars are not completely imagined?? Even then i also even admit that if a God was really all powerfull he could have created the world THREE SECONDS AGO but WHATEVER?!

"To posit a genius is somehow remembered and this is as a result of some market value seems rather invalid as first of all there did n't used to be a market value, even less did they ever get any share of a market so often, even less as time progressed, and even more so it is invalid as most genius is currently forgotten, and then they even state these genius are "not even genius, everyone can be a genius." This is a whole thread of erronous assumptions that only this manifest can unravel."

"We have no inclination to decide for you whether you like rococo over Baroque, or Roman over Gothic, in any case as any art style would have its characteristics and appeal, however to consider modern architecture and this whole hive and not assert some problem with "subjectivity" all together it seems that, those who would assert already ties with any classical culture have already done so, and all there is for those who do not assert ties with classical culture already for them there is nothing else but "nakedness"."
"If the richest man on earth would tell all others what they needed to sacrifice to survive and surrender nothing of his own wealth, then this would still be a sound plan, now you could survive and have a way to do it. Justice does n't have the least bit to do with it. You could wonder what of his wealth you would really want for yourself. Or how many would want his wealth etc. Or how he could devide all that wealth to everyones further sustenance. But mathematically as materially all this "justice" and all these "arguments against hypocrisy" hold no water or ground whatsoever. I don't suppose the poor NOR the rich have any idea how to even begin to save the earth. If you did not consider it remotely possible, you would n't surrender any rights , you would bargain at hells door step for the last ounces of your retirement, and if you considered it remotely possible, you would surrender only when YOUR end would matter. But to any fair witness, to any objective spectator, the WHOLE world and reality is hypocritical. THE MASSES are hypocritical and entirely dumb founded, as for such a clearly superstitious whole of subject culture. THere is indeed not ONE opinion that would save the earth. Not of politicians or people in the streets. It is an entire culture and fetish all together of MINDLESS carnal self indulgence and global destruction. And to some even, and to politicians , and advertisement too, they are mainly there to keep up the appearence of our "aqcuired wealth, values and progress, godspeed modernism" not a communist or fascist or anarchist or a scientologist or psychiatrist or what may that does n't agree with it untill you read this and got out of the sect all together.

Where it is then entirely natural that "Renaissence" rediscovers the Pagans, that the "Romantics" rediscover Medieval and lend from John Milton, that the Neoclassics rediscover the pagan, where the "Gothics" form out of an affect of the medieval and the "Gothics" of today rediscover Gothic fiction etc, what is then left outside all that is the unaware or unformed, the slick just normally endowed in others teachings, entirely living with the bare essentials of commercial enterprise and in effect, unaware their irony came from the surrealists. But in effect the bourgois once so hypocritical and esteemed defending beauty became the modernists now and the avant garde started to seaze back to beauty, in an evil garment. There must be something of an ethics of beauty and form in that. But that any consideration of beauty or the classical would then be "subjective" makes absolutely no sense.

More then the "new" it is legio that this cult of the "new" goes into perpetual repeat?? Drive your car in circles, play the most superficial pop song from the eighties once more, cut your hair, get a job at the factory, breed one point five children. And this could go on forever then? Yes out of any relation to the classical you can "grow out of that" and join this modernist sect.

If all of modernism would realize, which it indeed does n't realize, that it should n't be a dogma over beauty or not beauty, that there is indeed only melioratives or pejoratives on beauty or nothing or atheism or conceptualism or minimalism, but it does n't accept that is a dogma provided by the whole subjectivity concept.

It is amusing as it should be some cause to bewilderment that the authoritarians say there is a problem with authority, when there is none, and this is a democracy. Whereas the progressives battle anyone that seeks to arouse some kind of individual emancipation opposed to the sterile masses. How any makes sense here is not entirely clear. What none of them touch is the root of the matter, for which first of all you need to read a few books, and then see the paradox in all of modernism. None of which is in the books at all, it is here, the books, ounces of it, could lead you back here, where you go from here, is here. In any case this manifest simply does n't allow the left to tout "everything is subjective, so you must all adhere to nothing" nor can the right tout "there is nothing in subjectivity, so you must all adhere to histories paradoxes and conservative considerations." What I have done is rectified a few paradoxes and opened some other imaginative ideas. All of which can then be considered brilliant, and also implies i have a few issues with the status quo and other normalities and "people in general".

Its basically unsound that such a genius as Schopenhauer would state that to redraw into art as a refuge to society. Subsequently killing all idealists and artists and making them self destruct. To then have Nietzsche more or less emancipating every individual to become a tyrant. All of this is unsound?! Marx and Hegel then can equally be considered unsound. Michel Foucault was on to that while Noam Chomsky dispite his benevolence as a person has no insight in the paradoxes of all of this.
"Just know that subjectivity is the naked essence that which does not know the object, so it does not identify with it, so the hollow crowd ends up spouting abject matter as it does not study nor had vision, and that is the reality we end up with. Ironically -indeed irony exists- to not identify with the object and thus throw away all imagination (where it concerns religion, an ethical consideration more based in nature or primordial lesson and hyerarchical consideration or devotion) on one hand and all serenity (where it concerns esthetics or man or a young female for that matter central) on the other hand. This would basically end up in a complete mess, a putrid brown smudge, a world without sculptures or stories, without stories of moral and meaning. A void reality. WHere only trivial pulp rises to the top. WHere meaning is filtered out and rich language is incomprehensable to the majority and perpetually tossed into the sewer.

"Yes the great distance, which has been existing since the romantics, and slowly left the masses to rot, this chasm has only widened, naturally the artist is the furthest removed from any convention of society, then again. Who will win? The factory? Or the dreamer. If they say "everything is just subjective" then the dreamer is a component. If the dreamer on the other hand goes "this factory is a dream" then we have slightly reversed matters and need to state some solutions.

Where it is presumed an adult loozes his innocence, we more so consider he still has that, each can still be moving in his childlike behavior in any way. It is more the adults don't posses the denouncation of conventions much as the sensitive thinkers. To be a subject one should only know to stand naked plucking berries, even so far as cultures before the "subject notions" they actually KNEW the object which would have been their cultures THEMSELVES?? To just blatantly start talking about objects and subjects is, resulting into and finally did come out of some description of aliens for those who know the exact truth. It would befit to have some scepcis to that as well, that is not easy growing up in this place today. In any case the consideration of each as a subject would stipulate not only to "serve" some unknown and metaphysical opinion (nothing, and to share nothing, and be subserviant to THAT?!) and also to want and be granted everything to any scientific gratification. Which also is n't treu. THis then as conformism will induce everyone to want, that car, and then want, two cars etc, or will entice subjects to say "yes i need closets for my clothes" and "this toilet needs to show the drainage" it can not think a way outside of conformism. Then it can only think to have all the luxury in the world because after all it is "a subject just as that rich subject" etc. "why can i not have that too" "he is a subject just like me" and then this needs to be the end game here, as much as "the lottery is anyones game" and "everyone should have a chance to succeed in capitalism" which then also implies "capitalism should make everyone rich and to own as greatest amounts of luxury tourism vacations closets and toilets etc" as long as it looks alike. When then the king does n't order from Ikea they forget that its an artist basically just crafting a unique item, now you get a kings dishes for 1 euro something they would just throw away. "But law and behold if you would dare to be self indulgent". So in effect, which was a childrens game, will always be a childrens game. No one grows up here clearly?!

"Go tell Mies Van Rohe or perhaps Immanuel Kant that everything is subjective and they should intervene in the discourse of architecture or philosophy too much??? MAYBE you SHOULD have thought of that. AT AN EARLIER DATE???"
Now the hardcore truth about all this pluralism and multiculturalism let me first state a bare and considerably "fascist" consideration but which none the less is treu, nobody goes to a country out of the "goodness of their heart" and "to support the other culture" they come for opportunity and usually towards the vacuum. Which vacuum anyone including myself would consider to FILL. Now there are supermarkets and highways, that as much i have found. For this culture to be "filled" with anything me personally with "western" and "aristocratic" and "decadent" as "hyperesthetic" considerations ALSO should be allowed the opportunity to speak. THIS ENTIRELY differing from the notion of what could actually be DONE.

Now you can DO one ONE of TWO THINGS, deport all the islamic, or build them a persian palace in stead of ghetto's. YOU CANT DEPORT THEM AND BUILD THEM A PERSIAN PALACE at the same time. And even then, considering i'm a compositionist and this is EUROPE we probably MIGHT do something in the middle. THATS NOT the racism on one hand of individuals or right wing blabber all together and IT IS NOT the subjectivism opposition we have NOW. Its entirely different. BUT to CONSOLE the ones who like culture and their own culture AND to console the subjects of who'm we know i don't fancy it all together but MERELY because of the dicision seems to be ABOUT SPLIT IN TWO PIECES maybe THE TRUTH should also be split in two pieces WHATEVER THAT TRUTH MAY BE?! And I and everyone needs to sort of contrive or constreu something halfway. FOR THIS what is going on NOW?? NO! NOT either way of any way right now, THIS is SHIT. In any case it would still be possible, perhaps, to build ALL immigrated cultures their PERSIAN or HINDU night stores and whatever may be. THey WOULD STILL have more culture already then WESTERN culture?! But NOTHING and GARBAGE culture for all and SHOVE ARTISTS ON A CLOUD OR INTO PSYCHIATRY ETC AND ALL THAT. FUCK OFF.

Now it is evidential that ANY leader who does n't act on behalf or settles things for the right will be executed from about anyone of half the population on the right and anyone who does n't settle things for the left and does n't act on behalf of pluralism and ecology gets executed ON THE SPOT for not serving the left wing position. Me i have not the slightest notion of left nor right and besides that if you shoot me if you execute me on the spot you'll never even have a chance according to my own modest and philosophical assumptions. NOT going anywhere is DYING, ME MYSELF i just want to be advised by INTELLIGENCE who takes these things into CONSIDERATION. I DO NOT want to just stack cages and invite all Africa in I DO NOT want to gass any jews and or islamic i can be considered islamic as i consider THE PROPHET THE PROPHET and consider a name also a depiction so you know how fundamentalist i am. I even have considerations on how to depict ALLAH without depicting him etc. CONSIDERING ALL that i can be considered a prophet, an artist, an architect, or a modest polician as far as all these left wing politicians and right wing politicians i have seen i have HARDER nuts to crack then their blabbering all over for a status quo which is going nowhere i have a FUTURE to build i don't deal with "i provide more home, kitchen or garden sales" and such bollocks. I am NOT a banker to go "owh i create soem money to lend for cars and houses." ALL that SHIT is completely redundant to me and a complete bankrupcy to the planet all together. I am what is known as the artist to propose to the bank a CLASSICAL TEMPLE and can not commemorate the name of the bank as it is TOO MODERN and UTTERLY INSIGNIFICANT. So THEN i would be a PROPHET.

So as far as that goes, all these previous considerations, we could then consider. If sustenance and whining and perpetual materialism and garbage and opinions are important, then also I can do that. And consider all your opinions that i hear could be for a bar or your neighbour. If it is all that counts my personal wealth and my own opinion then i could say, EUROPE needs NOTHING but A KING to furbish the craftsmanship and ecological care for EUROPE as a PALACE, everything else has been tried and failed. IF EUROPE would have a king and all be furbished as the outskirts of a KINGS TASTES, then it would radically different. It would actually WORK. So then it MAY be known that with all this hogwash i NEVER wanted to lead EUrope, that i WANT to lead europe as it would fit my artistic project. But that I would definatly need some protection FROM THE BASE, which obviously hates me. And i need understanding FROM THE TOP, and the militant and ardent supporters of classic, ecologic, esthetic notions, even communist notions, any notions, and know that with presidents i will have little to nothing to discuss then radical changes to be implemented to greater behest of humanity. For which this humanity will hate me "owh you are taking my car" "owh i can't have another flatscreen" etc what will be starting to apply. companies going "owh making a solid product is not a good business model" etc. I SEE YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING SURVIVE, that is the one and only guarantee I have for you. For that i consolidate massive new philosophies apart from artistic awareness and bully MOST of you. By any means communist antifa or fascist, black metal or martial industrial ALL bullies MOST people. THIS they have in common. I'm just here to make compromises on how to get some art projects going for restoration of the planet. BY ALL MEANS don't think i ever wanted to be part of this. BY ALL MEANS don't think you will ever make it without a seriously intelligent person. If you don't believe in me, i suggest you wait for another, if i make it in any case would n't it be the MARKET to have decided? Because that is surely your metaphysics right now owww. A smartphone or survival of the species, why don't we let the market decide, and with enough advertisement i'm sure we get the smartphones over the survival of the species. THAT is THIS SOCIETY?! THERE NEVER WAS INDIVIDUALISM?!

When the business model and this "market" supposes this reality is essential it is diametrically opposed to a sober life and the survival of the species. Be that as it may you can discuss the reality you would have had without capitalism and communism and a "pluralist" market but for now with ALL knowledge we have is that houses and the whole earth is being STACKED with goods and about 40 to 60 percent of society is stacked WRONG and this can NEVER be resolved and mankind can never survive if this is not adressed. THE SUBJECTS and the bacterial growth of the economy is AT AN END and new theories will ALL be evaluated as no societal convention today (which societal convention is already very limited and entirely together opposed to this manifest) will survive nor have the earth survive. You don't know as much as me and "possibly" you never will be as "intelligent" as me POSSIBLY but then? would that matter? Or? Would that mean if i thought that or if i considered that you would not support me? I already know myself to be more intelligent then a lot of people, that COULD be used to adress a lot more intelligent people. It COULD ALSO shock and disgust the majority. Even then i'm afraid i'm at this point in life right now?!

"To put in the most blunt way. If philosophers saw the civilisations meet and oversaw the whole earth. They should have asked themselves "what composition and where to with all this" NOT should they have considered this subject to each an object or an object to each a subject nor even the theory of relativity if it was not more subjugated to the perspective of where you actually are to which the rest of reality WOULD be perpetually relative yes. Considering that if mankind would not exist, EXISTENCE of deserts without any mind on them or even black holes or suns alike would be RELATIVE. I assure you even they would NOT exist?! Thats NEW but by all means if you think of it how you can't prove reality without a human still in existance so SIMPLE a truth no matter how abberent and innovative that may be to society YOU CAN agree on that yes. And still that opposite truth with that "we can not agree on anything so must sustain all in every way possible" is all philosophy this whole circus thrives on. You had a philosopher to get you INTO that and i'm afraid whether those philosophers are popular or not a philosopher to get you OUT of that is bound to get HIS foot actually DOWN. Which means that i indeed stepped on the earth and realized i was actually here, and that you can all establish?! Maybe you should establish some things FOR YOURSELF, so you DID NT NEED ME?! But you CLEARLY need me. And that makes me anxious and nervous."

And lastly an introductory consideration to a militant Joan of Darkness who had to be suffocated by religion;...
"Maybe ME i would have been more keen within religion and liberate me or find a way out and YOU would have been more keen without support and like "whatever" and find a way out? Who knows maybe we had eachothers lives??
i could work with religion but what on earth do i do with "Whatever" A lesson would never frighten me, an indifference, ahhhhh welll."
You could say...
"I was educated with the trauma of indifference and flatulance of convictions, the natural outcome which is only greed and self centeredness. "
A treat i already excelled at, and would only confirm and calbrate finally with the extraordinary of my thoughts and the superb luxury of my tastes. Of who'm then if UNIQUE, must be incidentally SOCIETIES tastes. As there is no subject such a popular subject as a PERSONALITY.

As stated officially to my psychiatrist.
SO
"i can not stop thinking"
thats what YOU said
now you catgorize that then as "you are paranoid, you don't know shit"
but i can do that too?!
So you STOP thinking.
So by all means you are dogmatic and religious.
And i by means of "intelligence" which probably is also some kind of disease.
Can trace your religion far back.
Your need to conform to society and your judgement that i should conform to society EVEN if that society and the very dogma to conform to it make no sense for survival or considering the essential sustenance a human being needs to survive.
I ME i survived on candle light and got all the plastic and consumption out and threw away your modern society?
And this is supposed to be a pluralist subjective opinion for which i can not fight modern society?
Or for that sake burn its billboards (which i already explained to a psychiatrist in which instance he let me go, not withstanding i a was already awash in poison from your medication.) or attack its citizens, god forbid bash some consumers on the head with a sword? (which i have a RIGHT to do if you do not allow intelligence to meet other intelligence, if you prohibit intelligence from being published. If you explicitally strangle any kind of creativity for the sake of your "conformation")
That is in a nutshell the situation I am in, the situation this society is in and by means of your "pluralist institution" carry on to drug me and refute me and refuse to work with me etc.
Now the doctor SAID "i will read your manifest and hey it will be on this screen etc"
then he SAID "i will put you away forever"
which is it now? ACCEPTENCE? UNDERSTANDING? EMPATHY? A LISTENING EAR?
or some "we'll put you where the light don't shine"
WHICH?
I assure you that INDIFFERENCE i had plenty of that in my childhood and in this world.
THE IMPORTANCE OF MY WORK, that may sound a little bit like a christ complex in this reality but SERIOUSLY.
If i FEEL that the DOCTOR DOES NOT OR DOES NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND ME.
Then it is NATURAL and BEFIT he refers to me to another doctor.
If the psychologist says i don't understand a word you are saying just ask the doc for less medication he does n't care for your bollocks and all that. HOW can it be SAFE then to have LESS medication IF NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME?
HOW DOES THAT EVEN RELATE?????
IF TO ASK YOU
TO DO YOUR JOB
IS A POWERGAME?
THEN I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT YOU KNOW?
SHALL I FALL ON MY KNEES?
IS IT OKAY THEN IF I DEMAND SOME UNDERSTANDING?
IS IT THEN NOT A POWER GAME?
NOW IF I WOULD ACTUALLY SIT BEFORE THE DOCTOR
ON MY KNEES
HE WILL CONSIDER I AM BEING SARCASTIC
HE WILL CONSIDER IT A POWER GAME
BUT UNFORTUNATLY
IT IS BY GRAVE CONSIDERATION OF MY INTELLIGENCE ALONE
THAT I AM NOT CREDITED TO BE NOT IN POWER????
EVERYTHING TO CONSIDER ME NOT IN POWER IS DEEMED TO COME OUT AS BEING INSULTED BY A NATURAL AND SELF EVIDENTIAL SARCASM OF MY NATURAL POSITION?
NOW
if this state is considered PLURAL
and this psychiatry is considered TREATMENT
for any AILMENT
then my ailment is. IM SIMPLY TOO SMART AND TOO INCOMPATABLE WITH THIS DEBILITATED PRIMORDIAL CONSIDERATION OF DOING YOUR JOB AND ACRUING SOME MATERIAL WEALTH, ADDED TO THAT THAT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR JOB IS, UNLESS SOMEONE IDENTIFIED IT FOR YOU. WHICH IS IN ANY CASE WHAT DIFFERS THOSE TO STOP THINKING FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT STOP THINKING, I IDENTIFY YOUR JOB, YOU DO YOUR JOB AS I IDENTIFIED IT."
AS LONG AS THAT DOES NT HAPPEN WHICH CLEARLY IS NT HAPPENING, YOU DONT LIKE ME, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS VERY SIMPLE; I DONT LIKE THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE PEOPLE BEING IN CHARGE; I ACCEPT YOU ARE IN CHARGE, BUT UNFORTUNATLY AND AS STATED AT THE VERY BEGINNING, IT MAKES ME RATHER MISANTHROPIC, WHEN EVERYONE IN CHARGE AND THIS IS THE OUTCOME, NATURALLY IM ENTITLED IF I AM EQUAL TO EVERYONE, TO BE SLIGHTLY MISANTHROPIC?!

"WHICH BY ANY CHANCE YOU IDENTIFY ME NOT HAVING A REASON TO BE AT ALL MISANTHROPIC? IS WHY I AM MISANTHROPIC? AND IF I DO HAVE A REASON FOR BEING MISANTHROPIC? WHICH YOU CANT ACCEPT? BUT THEN WOULD CLEARLY SEE YOU TO UNDERSTIMATE WHAT EXACTLY MISANTHROPY MEANS TO ME PERSONALLY?!"
In other words if you do not permit THE LIGHT OF MY SOUL, INDIFFERENCE YOU CAN ALSO GET FROM ME, BUT YOU BETTER REALIZE WHO YOU HAD NOT GRANTED ANY LIGHT FROM?! AND FOR AS THAT SOME SURVIVAL IS ALL AT STAKE, AND YOU GET VERY LITTLE BASIC GOODS FOR THAT SAKE, THAT ASMUCH IS ANY LIGHT OR AN ADVERTISMENT THAT WAS NEEDED!!
All that BECAUSE IN MY TIME, ONE WOULD HAVE SOME REVERY, AS PATIENCE, AND GRACE OF COMMUNICATION, WE DID NT ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE AROUND PIGS AND IDIOTS ALL DAY? NOR HAVE THEM SCREAM EVERYWHERE ON TOP AND FROM BELOW?! WE WOULD HAVE SOME WAYS TO CONVENE, NOT HAVE YOUR MASS IDENTIFICITIONS COLONIZE EVERY FUCKING SQUARE METRE IN WHICHEVER WAY YOU CAN WITH YOUR SUBJECT AND HIVE COLONY.
There is only one thing a psychiatry is essentially befit. TO LISTEN, clearly i am not PARANOID, there is no identifiable DISEASE like that? CLEARLY I am pushing some other detrimental notion of society. CLEARLY IT IS MY DUTY TO ALERT YOU OF IT AND YOUR OBLIGATION TO TAKE IT UNDER CONSIDERATION
BECAUSE I KNOW ONE FUCKING THING
PARANOID? TAKE A LITTLE A LITTLE PILL?!
SUCCESS?
NIHIL
AS WE CAN ALSO SEE
SUICIDAL? TAKE A LITTLE PILL?!
SUCCESS
WELL COUNT THEM NOW HAHH?
HOW GOOD IS YOUR PSYCHIATRY
IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING UNTILL YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF MODERN SOCIETY? ADOPT A CLASSICAL LANGUAGE, AND START TO CONSIDER SHIT PROPERLY.
IT MERELY CONSTITUTES YOUR INDEFFERENCE THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY LABELS WHILE SAYING OWH ITS A LABEL, WHILE CERTIFYING THAT THERE IS AT ALL EVEN A PSYCHIATRY. PARADOX?!
WHAT I AM DOING, IS LABELING SOCIETY.
THAT THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION THEN TO BE INSANE AND TO BE LOCKED UP.
A THING OF WHICH YOU THINK IS.
A LACKING TO ADAPT TO THIS ALL NONSENSE?!
AS FAR AS THE POPE IS CONSERNED, IF HE WOULD BE A CHRIST OR A PROPHET FOR THAT MATTER AND COULD ENTICE THE WORLD TO CONSIDERABLE RESULT, HE COULD DRIVE THE WORLD OVER IN HIS FRICKING MOBILE AND EVEN HAVE 2000 PLANES AS HIS ESCORT, UNTILL THAT MATTER IF HE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT AND ENOUCAGE EVERYONE TO RESULTS THAT WE SURVIVE, HE CAN STAY THE FUCK INSIDE OF HIS VATICAN, EAT SOME BREAD, AND DRINK SOME WINE, AND HELP STACK A CHURCH SOMEWHERE, LIKE IS WHAT EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO. AS FAR AS THAT GOES WHAT IM PLOTTING ON IS GETTING CULTURES AND TEMPLES AND DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURE ARTISAN MADE IN AN ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABLE SETTING, IF I CAN DO THAT AND INDEED AM TRYING TO DO THAT I CAN HAVE PERKS YES. FOR EVEN SNOTTING APART OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT THERE ARE SUCH THINGS LIKE "PERKS" HAHHH. TO EACH ONES OWN. I HAVE A HIGH RESERVATION TO EVER LEAVE MY OWN CONTINENT NATURALLY, AND I HAVE A HIGH RESERVATION BUT TO WALK ON MY OWN TWO FEET, OR TO DO OTHER BUT A CHARIOT WITH HORSES TO GERMANY, IF EVERYTHING IS SUBJECTIVE MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER NOT TO REST ON INVENTORS AND WISE MEN AND PHILOSOPHERS LAURELS, WHICH IN ANY GIVEN EVENT WOULD YOU MODERN CITIZENS DEFINATLY NOT HAVE EVEN THE WORD SUBJECTIVITY, NOT HAVE YOUR WEALTH, AND CERTAINLY NOT YOUR CARS OR PLANES. SO HOW SUBJECTIVE DO YOU WANT TO GET?
NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE?! YOU CAN SURVIVE! AND YOU CAN ALL JUST WALK IN CIRCLES AROUND YOUR HOUSE, AND I CAN HAVE A "PERK". OR YOU CAN GO EXTINCT THATS IT, NOW CHOOSE, ITS YOUR CHOICE!!! YOU ARE, THE MAJORITY!!! YOU ARE, THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT, THAT HAS TO ELECT ME?!!!! GOOD LUCK!
BUT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW RESPECT FOR INTELLIGENCE AND IF ITS ALL FOR YOURSELF, AND BY YOURSELF, START FROM SCRATCH?! STRIP NAKED, DIG SOME ROOTS UP, NO CARS NOTHING OF CIVILISATION, IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A WASHUP HEDONIST OR WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU ARE. FORGET A SUPERMARKET YOU UNGRATEFULL SCUM. FETCH A ROOT. AND ALL THAT WAS DONE FOR CIVILIZATION BY STUDY? THE AVANT GARDE AND PERSISTANCE. AND NOW YOU WILL ALL SAY? SURVIVAL? NAHH, AS LONG AS I CAN HAVE MORE. WELL ITS CLEAR THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, AND IT IS CLEAR THAT IF YOU HAVE TO SOLVE SIXTY PERCENT REDUNDANT GARBAGE AND WASTE THAT IS CLEARLY MISPLACED NOW ACCORDING TO WHAT WOULD BE A NATURAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR SOCIETY, THEN SOMEONE HAS SHIT TO DO AND SHIT TO SORT OUT. SO DONT LOOK AT ME; ITS SEVEN BILLIONS SUBJECTS GOING TO SORT. ILL JUST SETTLE FOR THE LUXURY OF PRACTICING MY TWO FEET. AND GET SOME FREE DOPE FROM PSYCHIATRY.
If its JUST asserting ones own very STUPID opinion you'd be surprised how definitive i am, how far i take it, and how much necessity there is for it.
And YOU sit by, JUST observe the spaghetti with extra sauce advert, and then think without any study or scrupules you can STILL vote for the candidate for YOUR interests, not for everyone elses opinions, FOR YOUR opinions, not for ecology, FOR YOUR front lawn where everything will get better?! And then you are surprised why the factory keeps jetting all this garbage and why it keeps growing.
The people I already agree with I already agree with, the people who will consider me a prophet one day is the people who piss on me or on everything abundantly at this very moment. Its not they are very original at all. The treu awareness of this age was DESPAIR or AMOK. If you though to be some random joker well there is a lot of them yes what do you think people like us are fighting against?
If you are happily spitting and happily frustrated deu to a lack in consensus or hope then this manifest WILL HELP YOU. If you still don't care then DO NOT THINK I CAN NOT GET TO YOUR LEVEL AND NOT HAPPILY AND PERPETUALLY SPIT AND GET FRUSTRATED AT YOU AS WELL, in this modern notion of the ABSENCE OF TRUTH, tell ME about it?! I have LESS of that then you have for that matter.
But for that i KNOW now that in a democracy and market value principle the AVERAGE will dictate the truth and by all of my understanding very much so INTELLIGENCE was ALWAYS against it and always had to rebel against it. THE AVERAGE truth leaves you with NOTHING AT ALL. THE EXEPTIONAL, HAVE, and WILL always shatter it again.
The proposition is simply, if smaller grocery stores are ruined and these were still artisan stores and had some ritual and communal living, then you have supermarkets with everyone going in circles, and now you have groceries just to order, that JUST to make it all useless, and to ruin one with the other, then STILL you need an esthetic vision.
If then you consider i would have the wits to say "we leave the esthetic vision to all" well do you have any idea how unsound it is for Noam Chomsky and his teaching of anarcho capitalism when he does n't state a single measure and considers that they should all be equal while he has millions reading his books and his teachings go absolutely nowhere. You think THAT is going to solve matters? There will gladly be advisers there but hopefully for a "dear leader" that can distinguish fame from fascism and authority from a pop star, for that matter i would like to see someone who can "recognize" over "vote" too, whichever point the latter ever made then, the prior still has some old testimonies. With votes you have n't proven much at all yet with that. With buying the proper product you have not proven much with that at all EITHER.

So if you must know, it is not funny but indeed VERY IRONIC indeed that most authors today and in modernism are ironic existentialists, because they wallow in the futility of their or anyone elses existence, they are not even existentialists as THEY devised that you should LOOK for meaning. Now to no extent was i ever an IRONIC existentialist i did write some UTTERLY SELFDESTRUCTIVE existentialist books that i did not even consider publishing eventually, i mean you consider it but not really, i just reminisced on passed authors etc, untill i realized your prophecizing that?! So i thought how to get out? WHen i was rather considering art would indeed be an answer; (As i have analyzed now in a profound way, understand that who might be capable of that.) law and behold i also had a white dove at my window with which i lived for three years and lived on candle light and tore out all that was not completely classical in esthetics, i did not tear out technology i just furbished it differently, etc. When that is subjective of course that white dove it is a creature that but shits on the roof. TO MYSELF it is significantly MORE THEN THAT. TO MYSELF if reality IS SHIT i would severely want to destroy myself and considering modernism i would severely had wanted to write about something else then SHIT. Now i had it with people who ALWAYS have to refer to EVERYTHING being SHIT AND IT BEING WORTHLESS; that is MODERN, that white dove may not be a sign, but at least it gave me the idea THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO BE MODERN. So i left you behind, and i gave you an option. None of which attached together can ever be explained how thats done. I OFFER YOU to think about it, as you no doubt learnt to think for yourself by now, dispite the complete lack of SUBSTANCE for those thoughts, well now i give you substance, so don't WASTE IT. TRY to COMPOSE yourself.
VERY IRONIC, very inexplicable, for it to be a sign could be explained only in this way, that change was perpetually stuck in the scientific notion and the lack of spiritual thought. If esthetics could not exist as clearly it does n't with the lack of spiritual thought then you NEEDED a sign to evolve. Now there may not be much UTTER realization or reality whatsoever to the notion of such signs. EXCEPT when this age was entirely a notion and a realization that had to be surpassed. In effect it could only be a sign when time and evolution works BOTH ways. You are not only evolving from the past up to now, -which would imply the chaos of everything that you do and that nothing could exist and evolve eventually but a cancer- you are also evolving attracted from the future onwards. That would then be confirmed by, templars, elves armies, roman armies and what may, to actually understand they are not going to just stand there loitering, but also would need to get off their asses. TIME WILL TELL THEN??! But i surely have seen a lot of people on their asses and this whole structure to just waste as if there is no tomorrow; well i surely was n't agreeing with that for the longest time. 20 years to be exact. A roman soldier would n't have not had the nerve to kill for me if i told him what was at stake. Sadly enough it is proven i could not even kill for that. Its not even necessary. FAME can be enough, and then we can have GLORY again simply by standing in unison, and devise the proper decoration amongst us. WIth the labour force ALL TOO EAGER to build something MAJESTIC, with the right wingers ALL TOO EAGER TO RETURN, with the progressives ALL TOO EAGER TO HAVE JUSTICE AND SURVIVAL A GUARANTEED INCOME AND ECOLOGY AT THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE?! That there will be a lot less cars and most importantly a lot less STUPID cars will not be ANYONES concern after a little while. THough we may have to stack some peoples cars in piles around this little city. FOR SPECIAL EFFECT, CLEARLY YOU CAN SEE THAT "we'll buy the HOLLYWOOD LICENSE AND PURCHASE YOUR CAR FOR OUR MOVIE LATER. BUT IN ANY CASE FOR THAT AS OUR WARFARE AND NONE OF YOU SHOT OR STABBED AND ALSO SURVIVE AND KNOW YOUR PLACE, well we have done worse, once, to soldiers, as well as to civilians, does n't matter much, any soldier can be a civilian and every civilian can and may be adopted as a soldier once, as much any plebeian nature was featured in an aristocrat once and every aristocrat was considered a plebeian once, as much as, artists and philosophers and poets were considered working class, or subversive souls, sometimes the truth catches up with you.

"You are rejecting any kind of empathy i would have trying to convince me to have more empathy?
How are you going to convince me to have empathy if you reject empathy?
If i consider you have suffered you won't believe it unless your suffering must have been greater then mine?
I have Sincerely felt empathy for many people and also for you i don't feel the need to consider that empathy for me needs to be absolute i'm considering a general principle of modern philosophy and the fact i have to put a stop to that.
Nor does empathy rest solely on having empathy for one person and regard this person above all other persons including yourself you conflate christian matrimony for empathy. And i don't believe in that i believe we are all in this together.
I can't very well consider that my general philosophy for general well being is conflated in its turn for empathy for you above all others and leave everyone out i'm dealing with idealism not with personal household arrangements. I can't accept my general philosophy means you need to feel left out and abandoned as then I would write things solely for you and write poems and such and lead a life far away from society in a forest in a cottage somewhere but that as much is not the job of idealists if you were born and destined to be one.
If empathy means you can be humble, as empathy would deem you can be made smaller then the other to deserve it or that the other makes himself or herself smaller then the ones to have empathy for, then one or i can have empathy for you, and make myself smaller. If anyone wants to manipulate or center themselves at the expence of all i say you are just what my psychiatrist deems as "playing power games" in which case the power game comes from both sides i imagine, and will always appear to come from both sides. Maybe we can all be as small or as huge as we can be or feel the need to be. it IS natural for me to be very sensitive and moved and for me to become the bottom of any assertation or attempt of someone to become assertive and then fly away to my loneliness yes that is what usually happens. I can be assertive on my own and people can be assertive on their own you don't need people for that i don't like to play peoples games, again i'm just naturally sensitive and frail if you don't believe I can have empathy or feel empathy for you then i assure you i can be very humble. But if you demand that, then i can be very far away, and that is the complicated and uncompromising of my nature, and the usual conflict with people. I AM the BOTTOM of things, THE PIT, the BEING AND SITTING AND THINKING, if you are not more frail then me, go away, and you ALL go away!! Sit in perpetual loneliness, as i have no business quarrelling with you. I am GLAD to exist, which by any perspective means you are too idle to that existence if you are not as frail as me. And if you mean to belittle me or negotiate with me, you are probably already considering to stab me, as i give no other reason for you, then to take your swords elswhere, that is why i am alone, at peace, with a sword that never kills, that is why you have other people, with a sword that is meant to fight, and many who are willing to confront you.
If you demanded something from me, then in all luxury of modern era we can say it takes no great effort to simply exist. There are plenty of those to demand much greater things then to simply exist, and in that the world is rotten. So if that even is not granted to me in all this luxury. To be without anyone demanding me this or that. To not be in terms and console mutually, then your presence is not for me, not in my vicinity. I will not use a sword for a soldier, i will ask him if he wants a sword, i will not either use a whip on a woman, i will ask her if i can be permitted, that does not mean i have to be guaranteed all the justice in the world for every hulk hogan to a duel and win it, nor does it imply that if a woman is asked the strokes of a whip or has had of this whip, that i HAVE to be asked or HAVE to be given strokes of the WHIP.
I do not go to war on my own or for any other reason then the common good and chivalry alike.
So i don't have to.
I do not do dishes or do household choirs if i can prevent it, or if it is not solely a peacefull and undemanded joy, or a ritual, or a free strokes of water over my fingers, i can live fine on my own and if the dishes disturb you then give me some bread and water and there will be no dishes, then i miss the water strokes on my fingers, but if that needs to be under some terror, i have no business in modern rivalry among domesticated conventions of today.
If you don't give me anything at all. I will not need to whip any woman.
And with that. Any proper woman a victorian poetesse, knows where to find me, i'll be safely behind a whole lot of female militias.
If you don't believe that, shoot me and prove the world can end.
I assure you.
That you are in my head, and by no method will you ever get out of my head, and by no method may you ever live on in peace or not see the ultimate despair, IF I MUST DIE!!!
"You have known, a simple mind, simple as everyone else, with his simple and modest analysis of the age and analysis of the problems and analysis of the erronous assumptions, but who will now need to assert a huge leap over so many simple minds, and their simple and modest two seconds decisions, in a world their repetitive modern cult of no change and no hope, or those merely as salesemans tricks without vision or the least amount of brains or a measure of knowledge what on earth that would take to have hope and to what measure change was needed?!"
Do with that as a war cry or a political statement what you must.

There is no point for the melancholic the creative and the wise to be strangled in a structure that mere compartmentalizes, not need them, not recognize them nor reply to them in any way beneficial, we offer in stead of conquest designs, for all underground cultures, and for the underground to back up, these are ideas other then the structure, if you choose to be in the structure, there in the top left corner is the button to exit this site, an arrow, forget you ever were here.

Everything is always subjective, and utterly tedious by that, until its halloween, well then all cultures suddenly come out again. But what structure really allows this? Should not halloween be indeed EVERY DAY? Well we have the designs, so get your behind somewhere where it belongs. Maybe then it is only befit, for this arch symbolism era perhaps simply be called Halloween? Upon post modernism the reaffirmation of all past cultures? What is in a name. We still need to wipe the floor with this subjectivism that is the arbiter of all the nothingness. And Arch symbolism addressing the late victorian pluralism and newer expressions on the academic peak of techniques 
Arch symbolism, keen not to simply make it a meme culture again. Halloween would be another meme culture but it is the gist of it, let alone we should n’t be sour for the next avant garde coming after again.


The skin of reality is what the senses are bound to
we can't go outside of that.
Its like identifying with the gender you already are
its useless, but, in this time, very essential
Where identifying with the gender though is a presumptuous concoction.
The skin of reality is a usefull and absolutely relevant tool to think and create art.
if you go out of that you are not in touch with your senses, ideals cast by senses, motivations urged and bound in senses; you will see that relativism and deconstruction follows then soon.
you diminish your soul.
Your soul is bound to the senses, in an entirely artisan and natural way. To furbish this notion SCIENTIFICALLY is what is described here, without which you can’t escape the past 200 years of deconstruction. Especially Schopenhauer was never overcome, and created the crisis that is this time. 


We mean to conquer Europe at least with Black and other Metal legions, furbish a belt of grand arts all over Europe, emancipating all cosplayer styles, classic as modern, whatever can be used, and furbish them architecture, we have form be our guide, fantasy be our guide. We stop the structure from eating up the world by building higher and more classical. Alas, for such a decorative culture most people are a little dazzled and numb. LISTEN YE WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE APART. Leave them be and retreat. We need our 1111 elves just to decide on ecology, supported by our 3000 6000 and 9000 wise councils. We need our angels from the bible belts saved, and build them a fortress. I had a sign, trust me, its necessary, if not, who cares, we do it anyway, because mankind needs someone to have a sinister plot against the ever stagnating masses!!! We need to build ONE city up to classical standard again and can develop new capitals for all cultures while we retreat from nature and provide again to the earth. WE NEED TO FIND EVERYONE, dispersed, sometimes playing peek a boo on all these social media channels, but finally hopelessly lost. We did n’t get to blues, rock to metal to punk to gothic trash to death to black to dungeon synth for no reason. We need all our vampires to build them a gothic avenue. Cube reality and status quo is over.


The past philosophers left either a crisis which turns the mainstream now very grey, and there was a revolt now running a dead course, all life has been sucked out. Any provocative thought or trying to re-address the classics is discarded automatically as uncommercial. People find communality in saying everyone is alone and life is a failed system, you would end up being very alone saying there is always communality. You end up being a pariah if you rise up for beauty sake, criticism is legio, drifting atop the same hysteria, criticism is what modernism wants, then they get attention, saying its bad art usually has the least inspired people again going that it is a subjective value, indeed that's what everyone knows these days, we need a thorough examination. Bland people are attracted to the mainstream like moths are attracted to light, then a provocation or a moment of genius leaves them uncomfortable. Superficiality can only polarize, and the more nuanced provoke, but in the nuance the agitation and grumpiness and conservative of the plebs in charge is already known. Likewise the subjectivity everyone supposes presupposes agreeing with everyone else leaving nothing to one self, this is the beehive, the uniformity and anonymity. This is the problem which when it is seen forms a new avant garde and which the most intelligent only today could understand. It is the actual reality and state of intelligence, as it committed suicide in a long thread, and where the obsolete and trivial opinion not understanding this essence run amok everywhere. We are nowhere if we would reside in a forest or attend masses in church, we see this paradox at the frontline of thought, it is not somehow we went conservative. We bear witness to the root problem of the progressive. We then trail this main critique of society along; tracing it in all these messages in cult notions where society tries to address the problems and pitfalls of being lost. And where it is keen or demanding, screaming for a solution. We trace this here in the problem of the decorative versus the functional, esthetics, and hedonism versus any credibility of nature. The ecology. Hence the machine you have found consists of two main legs for reevaluation: the esthetic and ecology for renaissance.


"The past had the avant garde always known throughout the culture, today in this dreary ordinary and naturalist land the conscious of the historic threads that lead here and the awareness of the perspective of idealism is lost everywhere, as its vigor has decayed over time. We are talking about the romantic, the symbolist, the avant garde and surrealist considerations… There are decoratively staged pictures made every day, there is a whole underground full of refreshing ideas. This is why we created this site for the "life of the mind" and those akin to the classic decorative ivory tower as the surrealist revolt. That the modern bourgeois lost in cheap culture stands there naked does n't mean we have no keenness on content. On the contrary the mere gimmicks for arts sake seem lost and a profound classic foundation on what you know is all the more relevant today. As in individualism it does n't matter to deconstruct no more, one needs to build up one's own, stating things about the world IS the world and considering it is individualism one is Christ giving meaning or one better shut up. Then it is clear one will need the classics. Todays pleb culture will drive an intelligent man insane. Even so, an elf cosplay picture of such beauty would have any mainstream media shatter?! It simply can’t be done; they don’t tolerate eachother as the mainstream is the bourgeois naked as postulated before. You detach and have disgust for it, in which case you are lost on your own. And then you are welcome here. Or you can assume a vegetative state with them. Or troll them. In that case stay away, troll them good, but with no sense of principles or justice there will not be anything gained in that. Trolls are existentialists, they have nothing to contribute, they, -apart of irony- reverse it and make it ridiculous. To gain principles and justice out of Sade and Schopenhauer is peculiar, but not impossible, as judgementality and ordinaryness is also a feat of will and sadism, it is unfounded, it is all unfounded then, hence we are at war. At least here we stand for the merit of our talents if not our shining brilliance, if it is all an opinion then still we are afraid, even more so then before, the masses will not understand us, and indeed, so many were left behind, it has no idea. We exist to be forgotten, and those will return here." 

Secondary we are lost in an existential crisis, the "believe in yourself" stated to the others has you not believe in yourself?! (its actually quite complicit to the ghetto anonimity and despaired aggression increasing) The "think for yourself" has you no thoughts to savor. The "find meaning" has you no meaning for yourself? The whole modern discourse is a paradox. You can't derive composition or consensus out of that. The crisis is a paradox of its own faith. Like atheism it tells you no story, gives you no serenity for art, and leaves you with the whole empty box society is today.  So one should derive something else. That this would be a profound direction of establishing form  and matter and esthetics again is a cause very much lost to this age. But we have a sardonic tendency, these peoples superficial bubble in which they discourse for mere empty opinions without the actual substance of the philosophy of the opinion itself, the books on the opinion were soon dissolved for the superficial, and then the books were forgotten and but idle subjects stood there, with the most superficial drivel first, after all these are commercial times, get really shallow, that pays man. WHere the masses are set loose for their inferior drivel because the philosophers let them. Well. We can't teach THEM anything. It would just be a fraud. The ones who ventured into ails and sufferings of their existence in all this are worthy enough to venture back with us. People that just settle for the vegetative state and participate in half wit culture will never be of any use to us or to culture. They will marvel at Van Gogh when he is sold for Millions, they will kick him down when they pass him laying in the gutter. 


We describe the world, as its very essential to escape the modern bubble we have been forced to live in.
If we realize and describe this bubble and assess the material make up and build up of this reality. Then we find a consensus.
And then we may find common ground, we may have a word system not wrecked by inconsiderate back and forth.



We may regress and find those that have regressed and are already back in the more substantial books like we are. 

We mean to salvage the intelligent who are left with nothing but to stand there thinking in circles, we claim we have found a substance here, a solution in every sense of the word. if a wordsworth, byron, Mary and Pierce Bysse Shelly, Leight Hunt could find each other here, if a Hegel, Tieck, Schelling. could find each other here, a Goethe and a Schopenhauer, a Nietzsche and a Wagner and a king ludwig II, If De Goncourts, Barbaye d’Aurevilly, Huysmans and Villiers could find each other, if Michelangelo, Da Vinci and cellini can meet on the street corner which is this site, then it Will be a success, once the library fills the artists of whom we speak can gather around the manifest, now they are dispersed and not a word provocative and lacking commercial debility, could get through, so this underneath must be the new means to connect, may we learn then that that as manifest or this site does not have to be more treu, nothing is simply treu in itself or logically speaking, that is the error of this age, but let it simply be known that more actual rhetorics can drift on such irrational feelings, as on irrational feelings this age is a child that has been not told what beauty is, for the sake of logic, if that is not sad!! More then it is individualism we might consider.



We would dare to establish that matter, is not relative to the subject, to "know" that, or rather "if you would posit that" you also adjust the material -society, through the denouncing thought- to the relative, so how can iT be relative then? Well we can see now all the classical artists can do in their garage what they want but if you propose a formal work owh dont bother, but the same social consensus has run through this world, the status quo was disrupted and became a new one, Now it is a question if Duchamp would not have minded to work and his material in his garage then? Why did some build galleries in front of decorative art? Because it was time, well then it is time but also we can see we lost, no man is ever liberated, let this be the garage where we do what we want, let the world babble, Its not like they ever answer our mails or answer us with any substance, there is none in them and never will be. As it is the minimal is only one style, while you can clearly see on this machine the decorative styles are much more varied. As it is, after the impasse of a monotheïstic concept; we could all just go to the few remaining forest and take a stroll in toga and be polytheïsts, and there is nothing that could prevent us from actually pick up on that role and be in Rome Greece or Egypt?! That you can do that means modernism is a lie.







Kitsch in essence does not exist, certainly it does not philosophically exist, other then that iT formality exist, as iT would be mere concepts in a conceptual world, rather then actual decor people take more seriously, then of course, if you make good art they Will ask what does iT have to do with the age. But of course that was the problem to begin with. Everything was subjective, and so one could n't talk of good composition. Everything that was formal or in any way figurative or artisan was kitsch. Thats how this species developed ACTUALLY?! How absurd? To agree to disagree. And they have nothing left? To stand for finishing the artwork of the earth now well. We can see there is a lot of stupid things in our way. What a waste of time these past 100 years when in 1900 formal art was at its most idyllic. Technically the academics were ideal, technically, that is why when they mastered their art they started to experiment again in a downward spiral. And society needed to be destroyed of course, but no one bothers with that notion now. They effectively live, and abide, in a society of deconstruction which they should hate

Now its not clear, consider, Christ says this is my church, then they build churches everywhere. Now Kant says subject object drivel even more stupid and a little innerly twisted and the whole culture does something again. Then its not exactly clear what one is to do now?! Everyone is clearly babbling, in a bubble where apparently the fish with feet appeared after 22 years, this creature rejoyces, with all the oceans dead it thinks this little fish is some kind of prophecy to the restoration of the oceans, this is its Media, or how about “the north sea is sick its devastated, but there is good news, there are less accidents with ships.” How can the bourgeois and the pleb lack of character and resilience be any more exemplified then with that? Soon you would think this commerce its not its own pile of shit it creates but would be an actual unsurmountable solid culture with merit?! But someone to crawl underneath of it? Nor Satanists nor christians nor modernists want it. People are busy y'kno'?!
























We are forced to live in a shapeless meaningless realm of childish cattle sinking away into the past 200 years philosophical deconstruction and lack of personality, any media or commercial success to intelligence is impossible. This is why you are here, we have been meaning to find you. Advertisement and commercial media furbish light entertainment only and feature the disastrous development of human beings only as part of their gossip section. This is deplorable. The avant garde had some influence on people, they don’t take things so seriously, but now every time you utter an intelligence you are greeted with these hollow remarks and hollow stares. We realize we don’t belong here. People don’t talk from themselves against the world, they are dead and incoherent. They blame us from talking from ourselves against the world, usually people identify and talk like components. They speak from a system of subjectivity and reduce or make things relative. It should n’t be a surprise people again speak of individual personal taste if the system of subjectity crashes. This is then a heavy task for someone to wake up alone and simply tries to talk of esthetics, or composes a thread of thought. A genius would try to assemble coherent meaning. Everyone else's soul has been sucked out as depicted in the motion picture Dark City, a very allegoric representation of the anonymity of this age. That some people today will consider this is based on them, or they are perhaps a Neo, able to tune or fight reality may not be as much psychotic but merely indication of creative powers still somehow summarizing this age in fiction. Of course the profound theory why and whats next can not come from fiction. For that you need a total synthesis of society, not in the least a revolution in Urban design and media. We could then perceive this system as a meaning, if not an avant garde revolt against a tedious and decaying subject philosophy, leaving everything boyish and childish for everyone's leisure, an attitude effectively unbearable to us. As Breton said, the Bourgeois can not win. Now everyone became Bourgois, a cozy childish bourgeois, keeping up appearances. All the same, the past genius said what it wanted. today if you speak of esthetic tastes they consider it a violation of their opinion, even if its just abstract and they can’t defend it. How many times would you speak of a concrete form and they will answer “thats everyones own opinion” it is effectively all they say, they can’t speak, they don’t have rich sentences or vocabulary.
Artists with a little bit of background know this “opinion left unexpressed” and all the derivatives of that are a shambles. People will always go no one cares, while it is an engagement of black metal and the underground to resist by active disgust and various lyrics considering how stuck we are and for some malignant uprisal still very much possible.
Where Michel Foucault already said that whoever speaks of the French revolution he would strangle him with his corduroy jacket, it is quite sure that in the decay of systems of thought and his own system he wanted to attain a thought of power.
That the author signing below has forgotten the actual thought of insanity and now creates a system of meaning or something to do with that power is not just a bold entity of whenever wherever.
It is here and now.
We establish a center, individuals are just babbling and walking around, living in cubes, anticulture has been baptized to culture. They don’t even know who and why exactly that is. We don’t put the center as they do somewhere else, somewhere beyond their grasp or sympathy. People in their subject reality say i am one of billions, whereas those billions are very small minds meaning very little, as yet, anyone you meet in the streets will consent to them. If everyone thinks i can’t help it i’m just one among billions there is no center, no communication, no change but the populace hollow wants of more leisure sports entertainment and gossip. Then people will say its pretty absurd to just state your opinion. Its an actual breach with modernism. That the consequence is found by this author and people could find it useful is exactly considering everyone should think for themselves rather embarrassing, only considering genius said people should think for themselves we can consider it a failed experiment. In any case people were wondering, and did n’t offer a solution, so it became a crisis, if you experienced this crisis you need this and also the proposed solutions, as its not without fear and anxiety this solipsist mind trap of current age. That people do not understand you once you got out is mind blowing. Light minds insulate any genius and novelty with their blabber and blindness. Considering only genius can offer resolution from a problem it created, we can see the world is as it ideally should be, seventy percent is turning to powder, how Michel Foucault would have done it in the eighties is strange, but the way they are babbling in all directions today it is a simple matter to start a whole world government. Problem is how to go about it, how to find the others when everyone is just squealing in different directions, no point to them. And it leaves us pointless as well. This is why we talk about the stages of emancipation Paper, Printing Press, internet and Ayris Machine. In order to solve the crisis of individualism we need to find a share common esthetics again, or contrive a plot for those esthetics underneath.
That would then interest anyone in the thirty percent, the smartest first. Of course rather then polarize with left and right we brush against BOTH of them now. But there should be an entirely new dialectics to create change anyway, we dig for a whole other species and there is indeed not all that many other options.
If we create an aristocracy of the people and a new mythology of the senses who needs fascism or communism alike? Who needs a system that says you can’t be pluralist, you can’t do what you want? You can’t be decadent, decadent and doing what we want we have always done. This is no new thing?? And communism, anonymous components and no hierarchy and no large estates managed that can not ever be real? A castle should be built full of skyscrapers now? Better be to turn skyscrapers into castles in stead, or at least art deco towers as we propose, get some forests restored and some farms to provide the towers.





We see a lot of good art underground and a lot of movements who are serious about earth, nature and art, we do not accept them being kept below under the guise that its just subjective or that they just need to stick to reality, we also see a lot of art of which we don’t know what its made for, it’s not that someone’s opinion is suddenly superior because he gives a decent critique on what made this age and what were the pillars of thought on which modern art and modern theory is vested upon. We don’t accept a watered down reality under the fat monster of the mainstream with its cheap thrillers, games, entertainment and sports. We are Dantians, we stand with one foot in the middle ages of modernism and with one foot in the Renaissence of arch symbolism, which emancipates all subterrain movements classical features Surrealism, Irrationalist classical movements, etc, even abstraction or minimalism. We are here to give again opportunity to brilliance, and not in the least to have a review of what was once called beauty or decorative and is now deemed kitsch. This will appear a dead end and just another theory grabbed from the sky, but everyone keeps repeating these dead end arguments to stifle actual conversation or actual personality. Then we see the new becoming very bleak and uninspired; art is in a crisis, and when you read this manifest you should come out the other way. What we have as a frail gesture “look at this, look at what i did” is a very moving and genuine gesture, and Satans “What I love most about mankind, is its love for the arts” the “you are subjects adhere to this and whoever does not adhere to this is a paria and our enemy” is the downside of this naivitée, there is much generosity and curiosity around. To give it a safe environment and to refute the poisonous of the arrogant and the dumb and the melancholy of the frail we can offer this philosophy, as also the poisonous is derived from being misunderstood or facing something you do not understand, a penetrating light needs to shine on the industrialization of humans and this concept of the subject, and we propose then we do not talk of it no more, this derogatory of senses and spirituality as personality to the behest of a general amorphism, it is not a culture or a philosophy we need to consider. With art we argue there is nothing lost, if everything needs to bear results this so called truth of 200 years has delivered no results, but putting us in cages making us cattle and put the vulnerable and cherished in the streets with the trash. That this objection would deem us fascists or regressionists is unfortunate, but not any less amusing. The dictators walk away, then see where the masses and their “each their own opinion” and all that are left when this is analyzed and in its turn stacked with the trash where it belongs. Many peoples hobbies will have to become their professions, and many peoples professions will have to become their hobbies, a hobby, as something esthetic, will perhaps be needed to be calibrated as part of functionality again. As the decorative which is all things. Functionality so often is wasteful and an excuse to have more garbage. Again we need a thorough study of philosophy and practicality because this is impossible to reject with the challenges ahead. That the decorative is just there that it is futile is modernism shooting itself in the foot and defending itself in the hospital, it needs to be taken to the lunatic asylum or employed, all the decorative artists currently in the lunatic asylum or working for the do it yourself stores need to be emancipated. CLEARLY, because that is what everyone can SEE?? If you don’t SEE that, you are lost in rhetorical tricks, which indeed many people are, as the spirit of the time spits the same dogma’s about a hundred times a day on millions of channels. It is keen we put up an art nouveau bank in an art gallery now, it is keen we make art nouveau supermarkets, if people stand there dulled out when they look at art or walk in the streets it is again, keen, to entice them again. That modernism is a tricky religion to find a way out of is treu, but the analysis of modernism here should see everyone rejoice, we did find a way out. If Schopenhauer says “around every sun these balls on which one has secreted a living and knowledgable fungi” then that can be accounted as an opinion, it is actually part of the development of the crisis of the opinion. If then these days everyone says we are bacteria nothing more, and society treats us like that, then that is a religion. In 90’s philosophy books it is remarked, is subjectivity, what Schopenhauer said, again subjective. And indeed it is, many people fail to see the consequences, i have went to a psychiatry to speak about it 20 years ago, because all this would leave you totally destitute and in fear, many philosophers today probably commit suicide because of it, I have found a way out. Let my message be heard then and come to the aid of the frail, rise those who are brilliant, and emancipate the fight against a zombie culture. It is then necessary we speak of this dreaded politics and its diastruous left and right, but this is also a matter of this post subject notion, communist and fascist tendencies alike, we can’t use them either way. They both absorb into bitter delusions fragmentized truths. we will see here ALL own EVERYTHING now. Which is a disaster for both rich and poor alike. YOU OWN IT, YOU BROKE IT, YOU FIX IT, If you sold garbage you still own it, on the ayris machine we see everything as art as your creation is your output, your ideal, your property. The idiom to hold quality high was lost and needs to be retriever if we mean to get anywhere from this point. There is no rich or poor and definitely no subjectivity. You do what you can after this manifest has made you see the idle ways of your bitter subject delusions. Of which truths must be, again, terribly uncommercial and bitter in their turn for both left right in many ways. But a treu novel spirit and resurgence for the intelligence and character underneath, of who’m were lost in a despair they could not meddle in any way with the all web of idle and smug answers above and everywhere radiating the crowds. BOTH fascism, and communism, are meaty, ready made thick lumps of fat food for the masses. That is to say we are very dialectical in our approach, both can be used as inspiration, but to establish a culture you can’t use either, we see the hysteria of fascism and the amorph, formless of communism, which also completely identifies with the commodification of capitalism. Also communism and capitalism are either end of commodifying subjects or components as we consider. That then this should complemented by dystopian authors is self evident, it is also very unfortunate. By means of crowds always doing what you say, distopias are not a very good messianic force to be written down. This is the struggle artists have squandered. We need to regain our position. We are seeing the old principle of “divide and conquer” all over again, seven people are babbling their snotty opinions, and growing a hive on automatic pilot, only a machine which bluntly stacks the proper projects on top and reorganizes that wins. This structure can not win without individuals and what are politicians doing?  The same as advertisements. According to Schopenhauer and Mainlander and Hartmann this was the end or the culmination of the will to life. We should have seen total suicide by now because everything people could want is resolved, but they want more?? And they sit idle by with their acquisitions with the whole world capsizing. And who dares to ask these spoilt masses for sacrifices? We would forget that the masses were always the spoilt kings, an exceptional king, remains a feat of long expectation. And then there is the underground, of which lyrical content and eloquent as tranquil classicism is long overdue, it can not be recognized, because it, and every word of this manifest and art listed in these parts, are radically misocommercial, it grinds against the nouveau bourgeois and their new stubbornness and idleness, their clean minimal environments to cater to ever more industrialization, the dogma of anonymity and futility and the average. If something is not average, it can not get through. Again, as we say below, the masses, and this subject theory of the past 200 years,  it has involuntary created  a machine to feed the masses their own vomit, over and over again, and this will continue until we put a stop to it. This also has the imagination, with the deficit, the stagnation of subjectivity come to an end, which we aptly term the End Of Reality. Namely the reality where everyone goes, society is not only always and will always be driving around in cars and eating and watching to and going on vacation. It was also created in this fashion they think. They have n’t read philosophy, they are not in touch with history. And this all is a very suffocating environment. Then you have philosophers analyzing dead ends. And again in the underground where there is a considerable treat of brave defiance where they say “fight all circles and dead ends” some lyrics and culture of which Tristithea Ellhe De Ellendeh is grateful for. Then we we posit “the hobbies will have to be professions and the other way around” that also counts for halloween, apparently, -and even comedians who are reasonably avant garde aim their jokes at this- you can have an opinion, but all passed culture you can only dress like that on halloween, god forbid you would dress like any other culture but the very plebeian idea of modern subjectivism, that culture which does not even exist but in some derivative of all the past, then has to be the main culture, and they proclaim that subjectivity stipulates you must all think the SAME. this is the OPPOSITE of what it should be, yet the whole culture, and the philosophy of everyone works this way, no one is liberated by this, the gothics claim every day is halloween. And they are a subculture, fairies and renaissance fairs galore but they are a subculture. then when you read a book or are interested in fantasy or history etc you are a nerd, apparently all people before 1930 were nerds. It was the nerd time and now we have matured, into a stale mate of having the most popular trivial notion. Well these business suits and the ever expanding modest fashion also becomes a shambles and entirely embarrassing once its been stretched, now by means of a trait of subjectivity, that subjectivity is again subjective, you come out to a very different end. ALL becomes ratifiable, ALL past cultures, ALL new notions of esthetics, and this bee hive essentially, its -again- REALITY vanishes as snow under the sun. It HAS already vanished, Hollywood and all imagination ALREADY treats of these ideals, ALL motion picture WARNS and PROPHESIZES these ideals. THE DECORS are just being stacked in the wrong place, the bureaucracy just built another smoking section; hung a few more forms and signs, signed a few thousand more useless jobs that will be futile now, and very much futile in their own world, and futile in our future world, which at least would be sustainable… and this is what this manifest is here to fix. these business and other suits and modern people then become a kind of modern fascistoid “wardens of the concept” they exhume some kind of authority, and in every facet of culture it is then belittled, kitsch, togas, art nouveau, renaissance fairs, they are all within their control of the concept, and for to be in control you must look a concept warden and adhere to the everyone has their opinion, if they have an opinion it can be put in a glass box because they are peculiar and fit for halloween. Then these people roar and yell of indignation looook at this funny clown, and with WHAT philosophy in mind did you have then?? by any account it contests of a certain frailty and vulnerability again, these wardens of the concept are all the regular people who did n’t emancipate to that, and then it follows, all THOSE people are subject of the most hilarious tests, we can see these people they stand up when other people stand up in various funny ways, they have no scrupules, they aRE NOT THEMSELVES?! ALL their culture consists of is peer pressure, its hysteria of thin air, and then this modern culture deems classical cultures rediculous.It follows for fields of technology that an old computer or an old marvel of technology is not necessarily old, it is just more formal, that some people do not understand it is very futile, because the new has an ever narrower window, be it architecture or computers or anything new, it is always less formal, always less artisan, and always more readily replaceable, all skyscrapers full of offices built in the last twenty years can easily be replaced by a single AI computer chip stuck in the ground. No bigger then an electric cabin to fit wiring for a small suburbian street. Then you have a serious problem if you do not resort back to esthetics, the artisan, or some sort of identity with colors and odors and touch something. These people then gave everything up, their subject notion actually consists out of pushing the here and now to the somewhere some time. they don’t actually exist as they surrendered everything to the structure. Concepts like renaissance fairs and medieval battle reenactment fall in that trap too.  With modern degenerate emotions that advertisements are of course always surrounding the premise as the wardens and nurturers of the concepts.  It follows also for instance then, that modern psychiatry will consider something like “the nuns have their chapel, we have our chapel of nothing” apparently all surpassed vision and authors have to be psychotic, and their culture this culture of nothing is the only thing that can be tolerated, good, all past authors could be psychotic if your culture meant anything or stood for anything. But we may also endeavor something like, their views were visions and created this age, and not for it to stand still at this point. They created you, but you spit on them, you conceptualize them, you fictionalize them, you archeologize them, then if they existed today you would belittle them and say, what you say, i’m sorry “everyone has their own opinion” if you then oust an actual opinion they go ‘somewhere, sometime’, or go “some flamboyant leader will stand up.” And spout WHAT shit from his asshole for more “volksverlakkerij” folk con artistry? WITHOUT this manifest? HOW?
You then stand before the abyss indeed, and wonder how if Satan does n’t exist how i know him saying “What I love most about mankind, is its love for the arts” well everyone saying all that does n’t exist, its actually killing it, like the faeries, and with that they are also growing more souvenirs from china, it is the entire weight of the economy that whole “it does n’t exist” objectively, in the medium of art it very clearly exists, of which medium is today dead. In your head and clearly on the screen it all exists very real as the imagination ether. Wait until this machine calls entire species, underneath, and rises them to the surface; you then consider William Blake saw his brother take to heaven with angel wings?! You would feed him drugs because he is not allowed to see that?? Even so today modern patients have imagination entirely battered by modern concepts, but this is a normal and sometimes turbulent ways of creativity. Not am i saying like antipsychiatry that there is NO proof they are paranoid schizophrenics, i’m saying the whole prejudice towards creative freedom makes those places the civil indoctrination and power exertion and control of the subjects, again, who get dopamine hits for tedious tasks, and the creative people, who can’t adjust to tedious tasks and go; HEY, IS NT THIS AMAZING, I FOUND SOMETHING. and regular people go, no you are insane we must do the same always the same, an infinite amount of time, and never be creative. This is at first instance the masses who are mobilized, never mobilize, then they stagnate, then a genius needs to come as they are completely stuck. then wait, untill some day we create entire worlds like mythologies are know today. The meat spouting from a petry dish, some hoze with meat coming out is an ungraceful step we are at right now. But a flash drive to project food on one plate from some atoms is conceivable, by that an electronbubble is conceivable, at which point every magickal feat can be realized, technology currently deemed highly psychotic, only to be further investigated in 200 years?! Near future however, we have the construction of all mythological worlds as realms in virtual reality, and then, the history machine, if God can’t see you perhaps, then the history machine can, and who watches you then? Well angels for the most part, who delve into all corridors and peculiarities to study. No one needs to mind these are twenty year old blondes, take a shit in peace then with a dozen staring at you. They watch you in the future in real time, as camera’s will be installed everywhere and everything will be projected in a 3D virtual space, it also can calculate the past. So in the future, it can see your most private or intimate moments, or hear you think. Get used to THAT idea?! hahahaha. As then with this machine you can appear as angels before historical figures you can CHANGE history in that machine, you can see people who exist in other dimensions, you can never prove those dimensions, but you can find them, in my machine, an infinite amount of parallel universes is possible. And it is possible to even hear thoughts of people, i mean imagine, i wrote so many vectors in public ten years ago already, you can calculate every lamp post where it came from, so then you have more data, and the machine becomes more accurate, we have a lot of data on social media and every position an actor ever made, if you put all THAT In a virtual space it can calculate history fairly easy. Coupled to all biographical information of the earliest people, then you don’t need movies or battle reenactments to see REALITY, you got a very lively scene of everything, including yourself there at the end. And, Battle reenactment etc, also equally make the model more accurate, so it all comes down to the same deal, reality and the things social and modern media has to offer is just a sceam for reality to be calculated because finally IT WANTS to be calculated. YOu can’t stop that.

With the lemma serenity in the imagination is God then the arts  might actually, for the first time again in a hundred years, get a modus operandi, which it has n’t now, i mean they shove you in psychiatry if you are creative,  its saying take your pills, eat three meals a day this hour that hour this that, and its all different in every ward and they call it the structure, wauw, great scream, not transparent at all. Artworks may be reevaluated as its a direct reaction on the art for art sake of the late nineteenth which created the modern crisis in the first place. The Artisan is another leg, it is the aura of an object, the meticulous expression, of which the subjectity is the demeanor. Authenticity and the worn rigidity of the artisan was lost BOTH in philosophy and industrial production, for the reintroduction of authenticity, there needs to be the rigor of a characteristic philosophy. The new is dead, fantasy concepts are concidered everywhere, time to integrate the classical with newer creative design. That this world can’t carry on as it does, that no site, media or person or institution takes full responsability comes to our advantage, now here in these parts can the wise and artists take to compose a world, undisturbed, without reservations.

There is a street named after me in the Etherith Mythology The Street of Tristithea, it was crafted by an angel, put randomly in the world with no adjacent street at the beginning or the end, an angel who was sent by Aeylyealle himself to furbish a street to the Etherith Temple… But had no money left for it, an angel did it, for free, i brought the Etherith mythology in Latin words to a reading audience, and also wrote this manifest.
























In any case and before we begin, it is among seriously delusional concoctions of truths and whatever other notions you hold in regard, that in line with ALL communism, fascism, surrealism, avant gardism, conceptualism, minimalism God Forbid, Kantianism Hartmanism Mainlanderism and Nietzscheanism functionality etc ALL THAT!! -WITH ALL THAT i say, i have ALREADY composed MOST of the future, may I be so SMUG to assert that you have BUT TO BUILD IT. I assure you that considering a cathedral builder he has a statue at the cathedral and his name etc and the people who BUILD it are all commemorated in the STONES of the cathedral that all also evolves now. But reality is MY cathedral, think of that what you must. IF YOU KILL ME, you may always revive me and have me on a throne and grow UP in dignity and RULE perhaps in dignity etc. I DONT FRANKLY GIVE A SHIT MUCH AS YOU CAN TELL BY NOW. But who makes the cathedral, and who makes reality, can no longer be deleted from that picture, dead or alive. I will reap, as i have sown. Or again as prophecy notions are involved, everyone who sown, have also reaped, if you have modest, existential or ironic teachings they have ALL ALSO REAPED. clearly. What is actually known then is usually NOT left up to YOU OR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CIVILIZATION. And that can be considered simply a matter of practicality not something i ethically or morally agree with i find it myself MORALLY REPREHENSABLE. Thats entirely amusing, as i'm now considered both your king and king of kings as your dictator. The FIRST is by any notion of what i have seen, EASY, the second is dangerous and considering i rule reality, very much as if you had to score a whole earth of golf terrains in one hole. And still did it and there was no way you could ever miss?? I am in effect immortal. Again, dead or alive, depends on you what shape or form i will take. To DIE is not in effect NECESSARY right now. And if i actually believe that white dove in the next life, which i will NEED, will rely on the generosity and honousty of you mediocre pleb vermint. I will see it in you. So you can kill me, i can beat it, i'll sit an eternity without miracles and have a soul as a mind pure as a black hole, ferocious as a thousand pulsars, destroying worlds i have dreamed of it, majesty of irrational whims, and for my hate, building worlds that is what i effectively am about, irreverent from the meager conventions of modern life, as i was born there, but will never die there, goodbye, the door to you is closed, you can come in if you ask nicely, if you break it down again or concoct some more of your idle conspiracies in your short fused attention, the door will simply DISSAPEAR, and i will just be sitting there in vanity alone. Soldier and Emperor of vanity thank you very much, i have not seen many soldiers or emperors of vanity other then imbecils of vanity all together. "peace love etc" that was the hippie movement, feasting on meadows was invented there. I long considered some elves may actually be "radiated" by the lord of the rings and be at all interested to meet me. For THEM i devised a ELVES SENATE. NOW PLUCKING BERRIES NAKED is NOT hippie philosophy. IT IS ELVE PHILOSOPHY. Everything evolves. FROM THAT NOTION DERIVES, that EVERY AQCUISITION that we have today, may be otherwise evaluated as befit our survival and growing on other planets. If we recycle a HUNDRED PERCENT or SIXTY percent but surely no less of amount of cars of this planet into spaceships THIS IS ENTIRELY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ELVES SENATE. YOU SURVIVE OR YOU DO NOT SURVIVE, I AsSURE YOU WE DO OUR JOBS TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES, i'm afraid the earth and YOU YOURSELF have screwed it up somewhat and beyond some recognition. So if you want to indeed survive, listen to the coming elves senate and surrender your property appropriatly, we will NOT pluck berries naked for your camera teams to prove we are rudimentary and impoverished and to prove that we mean business, we DO however depict ourselves in elvin "art nouveau" clothing or other satanic and vampiric attire. IF AT ALL tailors are IN TIME.

A statue of the Greek Hermaphrodite alone would prove it. The conservative and utterly undone features of the modern boyish innocence and vanity of the civil is mind boggling. This statue and the fact they want to hide it is basically why i'm saying what i'm saying for twenty years and the reason the civil can't bear the smell of me.
The" greek sacred of sexuality opposed to the polarization of modern virtues
the civil are conservative and naive
its not about homoerotics
and it should n't be dramatic at all
its about the very natural of erotic deviation
as an essence to all things
mainly to the creative things
its not about homoerotics
The ordinaries concept of "kinks and shit"
is like saying culture is "white and nerdy"
thats like saying imagination and philosophy is "schizophrenic"
The polarization too of the Romantic Agony of Mario praz, the Sadean discourse of culture, the avant garde opposed to the conservative. Of which the avant garde lost, has somehow transormed into its opposite in woke, and the conservative which somehow now tries to get in touch with pluralism.
Its also like the usual resentment for the mainstream of kitsh features like Satan or Vampires
Or Black Metal or even Metal in general
Its indicative of the mainstream and its lack of passions or need for a magickal thinking deifying its passions, which it does n’t have in the first place. Or it would be the very stale representation in imagination of evil and good, of those very fictional heroes which again, was a culmination from the depletion in romantic era and of enlightenment, creative more distance to the object and distance from the subject to the formal, schizophrenic and esthetic, and open sexuology. A sexual abberation then that the modern is a parasite upon, considering some people like Praz or DOnald Thomas, who is then so inspired, but resorts to proclaim the moral melioratives of modern era which we contest and in all fairness have perpetrators of a much deeper despair if we consider the pedophilia and cat torturing, execution, mass shootings and other violance. Sexualization then which this manifest does n’t get into, for the reason the author does n’t deem any sexualization very relatable to a public for himself, since deviation is entirely skewed and would render it fully unconvincing to prove a point and since this sexualization was already thoroughly depleted by various authors, in which case of course they created more distance to the masses.  This manifest now goes into the very practical issues entirely vested upon mainstream discourse, and of course the deficit of its discourse. The deficit as unbeknownst, the generality of the subject again fed into itself, and therefore to the average nominator, only capable now to disapprove, unable to construct anything, because it would lead one from the hollow to the aberrant, core of provocation and passion, core of creativity and intuition, it would be truly new in that respect. This is why the status quo is the essence of civil degeneration, the degeneration deu to the mass psychosis and the progressive, alternative values who have long been discarded and moved in the pages of history which only academics read, or have some childish notions in the form of metal still going underground, but not with anything profound as to attain a level of authority at all. Where an esthetic object has now become a hobby, and entirely redundant to economic value, much like this the connaisseur or one who actually practices culture, along with gothics or metal or cosplay for that matter, or even wearing a baroque gown for a wedding it all becomes “nerdy”. The businessman has prevailed in putting a necktie and an entirely empty value at the forefront, an empty value which hollows itself out. Yes the merit here of this manifest is not in criticism, but in assessing that the status quo is not a status quo at all. Business as usual is a stagnant as yet for deepening of stagnation, a thing of which then it needs the progressive, or the avant garde, to enlighten it, to be its parasite, but only for a short remainder, in effect, it will topple. THis is why we called this the revenge of drama after all. That we propose the formalities of the past as esthetic libertinism then does n’t deem us inclusive of the pasts cruelties, this is merely a case for a new UNJUSTICE not exactly to reverse any justice attained, which we then see as only illusive, in so far as it stipulated some notions over others but entirely deflected the course of esthetics the formal and the libertine. Sade as an anarchistic force from below and Hitlers oppressive force from above both had the most debased escape of the most pertinent and admirable questions or rather positions of pagan reality. Meanwhile the middle class does n’t remember itself, it is completely without history, merit to its presence, or without a capacity to formulate a future, as much as the position “we individually try to survive is all that concerns people” is a notion of the past, so is the moral prerogative of the middle class being the worlds most prime chosen conspirator or protagonist of any esteem here. A vanity which this manifest proposes the underground should be taking away from it violently with the assumption of the serious accusations and priorities given here. More then Soddom and Gomorrah we would call it the upmost deplorable conjuction of middle class culture and mass hysteria however.
The collapse will be something entirely different from all its present day moral precoccupations.
More akin to some athetistic anticlimax, the indifference of nature, or the indifference of deserts before nature. ANd the incapacity of this dead body then, the middle class, or the masses for short, and their liveliness over any moral deviation, which is embarassing for the conductor and appalling to the spectator because of their incapacity to reflection, think over things, because they are soulless instruments. Coupled to the precarious position of almost falling into poverty, the dread of vulgarity and lack of comfort. As much as any comfort unrelinquished at any cost, even with their lives at stake, so too, for this little bit of comfort, it is natural for people not to relinquish their narrow minded morality. Counter intuitive at least for the creative, counter instinctive, unnatural, to the one who was akin and entirely familiar to the future, doom for sure.
The only purpose for this society, is the dead matter of the masses be returned to being the instrument of a sadistic destruction. We have to take the candy away from the baby. It serves absolutely no purpose to alleviate anyone from the antiquity of some primitive surrounds, this very dread of the vulgar of poor conditions is simply because they are just as dumb and henious where it concerns intelligence. Yes the simple mindedness to refute the formal of intelligence and manners which the aristocrat has been thought, and which is the nature of all genius, renders therefore the acquisitions of social revolutions and emancipation all in vain. On the contrary, as we say here, it ruined our chances for life in space and built 50 years of biospheres to get commuters out of the rain at the train station.This then does n't come from someone who wants to be apart of social conventions and needs to manifest himself, rather means that a casu of the principle you should be frankly obliterated without scrupules. I want no part or mean to relate in no way to your society. Be it modern, or the ilk that you were always apart of and always will be apart of. Whereas Camus and other intellectuals criticized Breton for saying it is the prime concept of surrealist principles to shoot at random into the crowd with a machine gun we can clearly see the audience did n’t give the voice to Camus so we can clearly see how it was necessary to be said. Camus, and Kant for that, gave the voice to the masses, upon which the masses forgot and started to squeal. Not in the least was it prone to decay in its own right. I mean we can see the thread, its only a self evident voice you find here for the need and keenness to rediscover and reorient. And this is done by a method of regression. Not here proposed a regression alike fascist dogma, but one on individual choice. As I made that choice, and have evolved entirely as an individual in that, it is relevant I would propose this to other subjects, who may be delusional of subjectivity and may as yet also like to develop into individuals, with more formal preferences of who’m are now discouraged and of which a language of this discouragement has been crafted to keep this down, to a very futile and insignificant and unmaintanable end by that. But perhaps even still, with this entirely material or more precisely estheticism of christian convictions and a sense of overcoming modern judgementality as materialism, as with overcoming a sense of hysteria and irony you may be actually moved again, moved to be so lost as i have, even more so when you would adopt this all alone as I have. WHen it is you being deeply troubled when you are compared to the amorph only, in that very sentiment, how profoundly you shoock, in that you will know how much you are alienated from them, and keen on feeling the disasters of this time. This entirely undone by the false pretentions of the individual liberation which is a literary litter as big as its garbage dumps and this affiliation to any but “Western rights” who can be keen only on the empty fodder necessary to produce it as yesterdays news, profitable when its todays waste in effect and very much related to that. The main point might still be, that the derailment of ones personal convictions, if they were more esthetic, spiritual, have no to succomb to greater society, it will appear this status quo will end very soon, maybe even only then when this is completely understood, and otherwise it will surely end in a beheaded, industrial consumption of all in its unlimited expansion, another way of contingency is not thinkable. This cartoon of a God pressing buttons from behind a computer screen then, would be the opposite of my mythology, the second or dual leg of this manifest, opposite to the ironic chronicallization of classic deity, whereas in my work it would be a more serious restoration and esthetically pleasing and serious esthetics of those deities. So suppose you had the unhindered glance, of looking behind reality, and twohundred years ago they would have wanted to build a church? And you could stop them. The underlying reason for this manifest and myth is to innovate that notion. And also claim that that problem, to have looked behind reality, or at least have diminished those that looked behind reality and its assumptions, has rendered a society that would stop the construction of said church. Not only that its idle ongoing itterations that we should n’t are the only patchwork that comprises its society. What the balance of that church is with ecology is then needed to be expressed, or, when our doom is already cast over us, what softened end we could have in adopting this material is provided. As it is explained here and solved how, spirituality can’t do without art and art can’t do without spirituality. So we can say this of purpose and conviction, if you do not have a purpose, you can not have a conviction, and if you do not have a conviction, you can not have a purpose. It is very alike to potency. No fetish without potency, no potency without fetish. The intermediary of all this is a kind of faith, with superstition as its material lever, intuition as its amorph thrust and art as its end result, a meaningful ritual as repurpose, a reallocation for art. It is in that it never was any less religious, the formal exercise, merely because of the doing and thread of cultures and masses, and the decay of innovative philosophy, that this manifest in itself, reasserts what is there, religion, only to formalize it again, which was lost deu to the philosophies of the individual. It is treu as i state here, that the artists now dance around a urinal as if its Mekka, they even call modern entertainment temples Mekka's now. This polarization between the west and other cultures then is a crisis, in turn creating a vacuum. And this vacuum then is defended in each verse which people spew today, and also defended against these ideas, of which i hear often an awh well your never going to get anywhere with it, which is the essence of the vacuum, in their subjective reality nothing matters, whereas in my reality again adhering to the object it is either treu or false. If its then treu or false you also admit that and get engaged, or be part of the dead matter of masses. The very nerve to consider something like nature a resource to be depleted when you have it as your house, and then when this is suggested, to stand idle by that suggestion because you consider it will not amount to your own or the majoraties investment in economic "realities" at the expence of the "ecologic fiction". Essentially the supreme lack of pride and worth of masses to scoff the facts under the table, -also part of their sexual uneases and insecurities- and in effect demolish their house, trading it off for a very carton board instant fabrication not to wither this storm as it is right now falling apart. And even then, in their dogmatic and incredibly stupid insolance they will refuse to admit the house is gone, because they have to admit it was because of their stupidity and coherence to the norm. The norm and coherence itself became the deficit, the aberration became the ones who had always warned them, and the slush of them is in effect the only thing they remember of the past. Yes the hysteria of the norm remembers only the aberration, because it did n’t actually study nor engage nor care for the past, as with spirituality and art then we could say. The lack of care for the past of todays society, feeds into its lack of study of it, and its lack of study of it. Etc.

Introduction.






"for beauty and for vision and for merit and intelligence there is now no economy, and for stacking a shitty house full of garbage there is no future? WHO will win?"

We are here to make worlds, to make fantasy reality to create empires of vampires on the moon and faeries on Mars, we have no limit in what we perceive to be beautiful, in that we master as we were deemed, cursed even, to be our own masters, BUT,... We respect you?! OR WE DISPISE YOU!!! If you can not respect ANYTHING, then please accept your position, we have met you before.

If there was n't anything more, if there was n't art and beauty above strife? Then mankind must perish. There is n't that now and mankind is perishing. And that is good.
To resolve that. And find a cohesive answer on what to do. You will find it with intelligence, artists. recluse, philosophers, renegades, classical minds. And they will be featured here.
To have them solve this society. refurbish, redecorate, compose without restrictions, in more then grandiose disgust for the very existence of this time and its greatest loud touting protagonists...
So do with this what you must. Leave this place, or join in a palace where you may and can have enemies, but where the main feature is the palace, to which we mean to conspire. No one likes everyone in this world, you are not sheep, that is clear, but you are on a meadow, or in a stable, someone is building that. There had been some industrial teaching, we have reached the limit of it. The criticism on society has itself become the society.
That palace we now own is the earth, this machine, the ayris machine, is a machine of the Gods, not the sheep... now a ruin left to rodents, this world is a ruin to be overcome, not to bring in your five cents to buy something, that will not resolve anything. As we state later, mankind is a commodity not a liability. This is such a vast factory, it were better if we were to produce, and produce for the better, but currently its all been sucked up by fat subjects. Well houses can not be stashed goods into forever. You can not fit such an infinate amount of kitchens, and they are trying, to make the kitchens collaps in some months, weeks maybe, so you have to buy another. Well then someone will just have to work again, someone will just have to waste again. The system. Is not at all anything BUT religious, apart from this form follows function etc. These are religious systems. And as there was christianity. Or pagans, the Christians as they did to pagans, the romantics as they did to christians, sought to disembowel, to go to the core, to the heart of the essential fibre of mainstream considerations and stake that heart, for the very destruction that must be the dialectical process. At no point do we concent any anwer of infior or mainstream drivle!! "It is just how it is" If one would burn people on a stake at these times. This whole pack and masses of "we can not change anything" needs to get its act together. Most protests are not even considered here?! Indicative ofan unease, beautiful in their chaos, identifying a coming destruction, but what do we share of their ideals? None?! MORE of this modern free garbage for a wealth is not considered. MORE middle class, MORE bourgoisy EVERYONE stacking industries on the world. IS NOT CONSIDERED?? Industrializing all IS NOT CONSIDERED?!We disgust people who want to conform, as they conform to a "subject" alien race. Bacteria. I mean to disgust them is to want them emancipated and be thought for some intelligence and beauty?? So are we really fascists??
As it is you hear these people thinking positive thoughts about these infinatly small projects everywhere, then again the world as such is stacked full of hope, it is becoming an awefull mess of those piles of hope filling this planet. To just see things in a very big perspective, comes with extraordinary responsabilities, and you can see its hopeless very much, its not always easy to attain, especially among the perpetually small and uninformed minds, but some people still do that. And they see, people just are not doing enough, not organized properly, and their main philosophy is flawed, not to say it is actually detrimental, the philosophy of the past twohundred years is the very cause of the deficit, and as a cherry on the pie then. This so called "modernism" (of which any generation was effectively fighting the spawnings and errors of the next one, and the earliest generations would watch in anguish where the latest generations pride themselves on what they accomplished on top of them, all this laissez faire and fighting for rights and wealth generation leading to an amorph industry and complete lack of composition for the sake of this abstract "subject" we all supposed to be.) well this modernism, clearly ended up above all in a complete opposite of national socialism, and anything remotely smelling classical in its nature, and essentially natural in its purity, is considered to be part of a genocidal maniacal cult. As if Hesiod or John Milton, Vergilius, Rabelais, Erasmus or Cervantez, or for that matter Giordano Bruno or God forbid William Turner or WIlliam Blake, Frederic Leighton, John William Waterhouse, Charles Van Der Stappen or any of those eminent artist we have as our fellows in this community had ever anything to do with the mass hysteria and assumptions, who simply now evolved to worship mass vomit, its not because there is no one responsable, not is some evil one single individual, we are not allowed to critique the masses in the brew they are distilling all together as all one individual or a whole pot of individuals, it is not because a dictator could not do other but arouse the masses to nonsensical hysteria, that they can not do that on their own?! To provoke with that creed and to provoke these easy and mellow assumptions was the choir of the underground, to take that to a next level is none other then pure world denouncation and actual individualism, as well as anarchy realized and a composition again considered. This vomit, that is the leftover and the very apocalyps of classical philosophy. Needs a definitive reply. Again. If the masses took the creeds of philosophers, and it turned into vomit? Then how on earth could you not critique vomit? Or the paradoxes of subjectivity turning into a culture?? If we trace that back? How much of this pluralism is really left? It was always just a crisis this pluralism. In all its facets. We trace this crisis, to its very definitive result, so that then, the modernists can have their dialectical answer, and preferably commit suicide because they are walking on plant growth and have to eat vegetative life which feels pain, and in which philosophy they walked, and can not get out of. Let us end that philosophy then, by confirming it. And see where and what answer it can now (not) lead to. I have myself and many among us, have gone to the full extent. And this is all you can come up with, after completely progressive views.
What is perhaps the majority is an opinion exactly, opposed to a general abstraction ABOUT opinions, which is what the main philosophical discourse was about. There are people very lost in that, and that then the ones to develop generalized abstractions would suddenly deem this opinion very vague and powerless would want a resurgance of beauty and antiquity in its decorative features well, that need not to be an opinion exactly, as that was usually the notion, the abstraction and the general analysis of things that emancipated the opinion, now time to emancipate it into different directions. If you would have emancipated something, and suddently it makes a new thought impossible or paralyzes it among the down trodden paths, among the unfertile land, and the peasents say hey. No manure here. In any given case you can consider to be a cog on a coghweel of the machine and it keeps spinning in this the way you see it everywhere. Or you let artists conspire of which main floor plan is already started here. Considering the gasoline spilled everywhere with the mainstream lack of credibility and in the full spectrum, and the lack of movement in society, it being stuck and repetitive without arts or new theories, it is effectively unable to breathe now. And then we would assume, the individual; babbling individual, can have his house and his cars, our militancy that spans the globe, nations, and across the complete spectrum of political parties. From Dali to Breton you could say. Well those houses and those cars will appear very worthless when they don't create a future or can not allow a beautiful landscape to exist, that in itself was suffocating, and the future, and a landscape was the essence it needed to realize in itself and for itself to breathe again. We may only assume a large militancy is gathered somehow, or a decorative world is not possible, all the world today, is there, because it is wanted, people have already got their needs met. What the masses do then is chicks tweeting for the mother chick, but there is nothing we can bring them, perhaps this one beautiful ideal then. But it was supposed to be... their own opinion, that would bring solace?! Hence why the emancipation of this "opinion" could never work?! And the weight of the structure was always somewhere completely elsewhere. That is why this manifest would be the majestic soaring of the imagination, where it was obstructed, and this for the emancipation once more of material art and wealth of civilization. Where that was, as far as considered subjective, now certainly uniform and monotone. We then can be considered symbolist, to support symbolism, being, "decorativists", compositionists, "antisolipsists" we refuse to accept the word modern, as it does n't work either, symbolism was modern, perhaps it was the last modern figurative, Well it still had man, and female, and nature central, later we have but satan central, we have little else left?! We did that, now we have no pluralism to condone, that the excuse for all these tedious buildings is that they are perpetually "innovative", and "modern" and that that is just how we do things now. For that to be a final truth, they would have to be innovative for millions of years to come, and they would be effectively as old as Rome or Egypt, but then they would be still called innovative, which is in itself a complete paradox, andso gladly we do not wait for that. We can assume in advance; that effectively it is soplipsistic. It can supposedly mean anything and so much, but its meaning is effectively infinatly small. We have walked through the fractal!!



So in that even uselessness would have no meaning without existence, then again if you posit it like that there are some things more preferable then the absurd dogma of the word uselessness. Rather then a dogma, the world of nuance of perception is the only truth, the richess of reality in its forms, and the richess of imagination as its wealth, and in that it shall be religious. Even modernism is a religious cult clearly, preaching against those who feast on blood of lambs orvirgins alike, but a sect of its own as completely analysed here, and to greater delight of the artists and the suicidal, consider this? These modernists blame symbolists for revering the "useless" object?? But they insist on idealism, which constitutes then subjectivity and can not be resolved, yes, has to be entirely superficial?? There is nothing subjective then the all surveying gaze of things as “the imagination ether” and there is nothing so majestic as the fact you can’t catch anything outside it and actually touch that, where you in effect walk in and through something of a “corridor of mirrors” which is perception in time, in which all memories are dreams alike ambitions, and also that through awareness and the point of existence of the moment and through the imagination, there is a crack in that mirror. Through the ages. And that as much is actually wonderfull. Metaphysics, our counsciouss is that crack. When we would be automized, this would be also automized, so we can think ourselves a hole through the mirror of reality itself, we surge from the heavens of the universe to the portrait against the wall, we are so fast, as our mind imagines to speed forth in ever more infinate space, in a second, we attain, and therefore the very next second of existence is a problem as a it needs a solution all together. Different from that postulate that we can not know what is behind it, and two subjects are effectively locked out of eachother, we can see everything crystalizes in emptyness as we try to agree on nothing, or becomes minimal when the imagination becomes virtual. It seems a natural canon of society. considerably bigger then may be assumed, and there are liberations and emancipations yet to be provided to be aware of that. And then the quest for beauty can only just begin. In any case this notion that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" or "is subjective" must die, as that is the transparancy, the invisable notion of beauty, then it is in no subject. It is this or that, mine here and yours there. But that must start somewhere. And did n't start for 200 years yet. It was ABOUT the subject. And now all seem standing in the same courtyard, with all the other courtyards vacant??! you had to agree to disagree, and you found nothing that you disagreed upon was left worthy to consider?! And you are supposed to be an asocial species? I have seen worse?! You are supposed to be violent people? Who torture and battle? And bomb and rape? You consider "we must bomb here, there" and you pride yourself "I bombed them and shown strength" and with an entire economy, trying to win some sort of grandiose game which you are perpetually loozing, in small gains or large sums aqcuired, you are loozing your game, and those who genuinly care for this social contract, seem ever more infinatly rediculous with their false cash and their clothing becoming ever more unfashionable and hopeless, those who do not care, or never had cares, but their own merit and ideas and crafting skills, seem ever more bewildered over this farce, and proud standing there in a wasteland. What now? Should i really shed more nakedness for emperors to bear themselves? Stack more fiction for you to understand time and esthetics? Or shall i do it all with me, here orating, and the frail and the artists at the core now, and start all over again?

There is n’t meaning then in how you robe meaning. In that, the lack of distinguished and serene art today. Is the greatest detriment and the greatest lie ever proposed for a religion. A stampede into the vacuous, and the emptyness, of which itself again has no meaning… Even the word would have no meaning, if it was n’t written virtually, in ink, or in gold. Then we have found the decorative is treu only in existence of its word and eloquence. Matter primes. Where the consensus is pluralism as long as its a crisis, where it is new as long as it is not classical or beautiful. Therefore everything that is not decorative is a lie; and everything is decorative. Modernism where it abandoned beauty, is the ordinary made into a little fantasy story. Naked Emperors, Brains equipped for eating other peoples flesh, stumbling in the streets. Now the symbolism and that awareness already lives, be it that to stow that into a philosophy has n’t been done yet, to form it into a cohesion has n’t been tried yet. To critique the subjectivity itself has n’t been done yet. In that modernism is a sect. That we have no more media, that commercialists will reject criticism, or any irony considering advertising as detrimental or God forbid, relative?! Now this hysterical, existentialist philosophy is defended as ardent as fascists or communists would defend, what is not commercial is demoted and shelved, "owh i have been so pluralistic i provided the populace what they "want" that is key. That we need the worlds underground to unite, the ones who CAN still be mobilized and are not absorbed in modern much ado about nothing but survival on trivial and futile luxuries then called "sustainability" of this "subject", and the machine to unite the underground against that; Is presented here. Then be it a future where the substance of meaning is to excell in the academic, the object of meaning, is the allegories delved from the mind anew, power is inspiration. Much like art is worth more money then money. Ideals are worth more then the economy. And the economy fails anyway. Its a factory you can’t stop. If you have no ideal, no concept of beauty or composition, and therefore if everything is subjective, you have no means to stop that factory. To direct the factory. You must have leaders for that. To see to composition. You must have man like Gods for that. For now, all leaders are conspiring to see the factory just to scurry along. Therefore the innovation of this little manifest. Is to my own great pleasure, the demise of modern society. That i have hated. Since the dawn of creation, and my feeble soul was potentially there. I will forever sleep well, my death is beautiful. As my last gasp will be in an excited anguish and excited rancour, I will spit at creation, my legacy is to see the inevtability of destruction and chaos to reign supreme again, I will take beauty into my sleep, as i will see it restored. And flail with it entirely or rise with it entirely. My death will be beauty, and my tombstone or memory will be a solid and undeniable aura. People can not mock me as ever i would refute them and have them in despair, wallow away into nothing. The ones to hate the decorative and esthetic prowess, the ones to be for a second, that i have worth enough to indeed live and preach. That to be my brother in that. And to respect any word i said. And not to discard it and be wavery into the detriment of reasons and considerations of futility abound. Where i was right for a second and for a moment found religion inside me. I can shine and feel it is enough to obliterate an entire world which is the same cancer of selfdestruction that is my greatest feat and joy. As society keeps its pace, i want to destroy it and destroy myself. As I managed indeed the words and the machine to do it. I will laugh and the strongest, settled in their towers laughing from above, or from a distance. I will forever be bound with the frailty, even moments of it, the sickly and the innocent and generous beauty that i love, and for moments had met its existence in this life. It is useless, but i will take a profit they say. Self fulfillment of rotten peoples. Death equals all and then it is for nothing they say. Self fulfilling legacy. So too does beauty fulfill itself. And in that, as an architect would own especially all the world ugly buildings, he savors the beauty as he can, and in that as an architect savors, i know in my decadent but superfluous heart i loved all the virginuous minds. Affinity with the detriment of death so supreme, it lay there as innocence, and warms with its company a remainder in art. Selfless as without senses, when you are dead it matters what you gave and not what you took. As what you have or be will be no more. And as much as life is social. A construct where you can find pleasure in giving attention because you get attention. So does this selfless act where you believe and utterly care beyond and dispite of yourself, becomes a death most beautiful, as nothing remains but your cares, and nothing remains but cares for you, while you have no care to be aware of, nothing to entice you, nothing to prolongue a motive to a further action. Revenge, is for beauty to pour into your grave. The only thing that keeps me alive. An extacy of things to come, an extacy for the future? Poets immortality revised, I had to life in your nightmare. In its friction i delved sparks throughout me and in that hate and sparkles flying from my hate against a dumb solid body that is your society. I already rest, your society is already dead, i am already dead. When misery creates sparks, so too death can be legacy to an aura. My passions, meandering, collidinng into other bodies of water, game of sheer power of electricity. Where this instrument, perception, was bound to play all the symphonies. So it will be, that they will have heard it, and this instrument is inspiration for so many new crafted jewels authentic and ingenious a mountain of violins, a tower of piano’s. With a mankind to revere always, and always to be guided and deluded, there is nothing among empty opinions then the beauty of my cancerous soul, self loathing, with an empire as we will see, of who’m is invited, in it, does not exist, and who trods and spits at it, is all too common and abound, the casual kisses i received from the grattitude i would bring something profound, is an empires worth, the empire, to the world is worth nothing, the world is worth nothing. An empire for a few friendly kisses. And the world to stumble then. As it will see to its ideals also a tombstone, bleak, ominous, without resolve or comfort, vague, to be forgotten, in the moment, a moment for me, hardly aware as you were, i will not be apart of it. I will join the ranks of my fellow carcasses, distinguished, peculiar, a unity of light,and frequently so dark in ourselves,...

...malign in our elegant sins...
As we would have credit for that over those who spat at normal things!
So often as our minds would rise.
So often again, by our frailty the unity of light feel in their hearts but melancholic cries.






The Imagination, architecture, sculptures, paintings, nature, perception, is the truth.
It is all and we are nothing but crystals of it leaving a coral of life, leaving an art project.
All is art, that is the torch we carried, and to which we are measured.
Any relation you had to arts, which is existence, is the light anyone can perceive.
Man anonymous is a one who gets one torch.
Genius is one who set the world on fire and of which all the torches of the people are filled with, or they carry now. When we are existence, it is very apparent, when we are not, we never were but an ounce of light still meandering. And that is outside us, as time renders us a thin invisable film which is the subject, and matter which is the torch.
To be a character, means you already won.
Nothing would appear so futile about that, but to file it within one allegory or notion; of which futility or uselessness or repetition are just, once again, a few allegories who apply. More so there is the allegory of “wondering” and “awe”, when we observe those allegories. If you had been bestowed futility it is indeed to looze a crowd, take it away into your feelings, of autism or neurosis alike.The crowd is what a genius must carry. For now they created inwardly dead beings. There is no one saying society is not dead. And there is no one who can deny that over the past 200 years genius was growing dead or confused.
It looked inside but to itself, and it got perpetually and infinatly confused.
To describe something outside yourself, or project an image, requires more boldness and perseverence, and disregard for the self or the self of others then they could muster for now.
Hence the crowd that listens, does n’t have the boldness and perseverence, and disregard for the self or the self of others.
And thus this culture, does n’t project anything outside, dispite themselves or others.
It is a cowardly, self absorbed, abstract remainder of pagan classical and even religious life.
Through the ages it became a chance to be religious and to wield so much power over masses and start arts beyond any insignificance. Then, with the powers to arts even more significant, they, Descartes Kant and the others, created a cult of the self, under a sky of nothingness, all little burning stars without any reservation, and no nothingness they would not choose to scream into as they were so frightened of it.
Now it all appears very trivial and a serious dead end.
A time where you can choose but two things. TO be numb, or to be insane.
In essence we shift reality here. From people who are within reality. We now say, we are all actors. In effect decoratively, that is treu, the balls or the casualties to be heroes do not matter no more in the arts where confides and condenses all reality at this other pole now. All the decors of fiction, where once, or in the future for that matter, a reality. Normality, the mainstream instant house. Is parallel to the actors stop motion, futile life; all other life is decorative and worthwhile. We can absorb the euphoria and the extacy of the actors will to live and crystalize that into fantasy. As much as schopenhauer already said that the highest refuge of the will to live is art. And as much as conceptual art already noticed that any art is that of which we say it is art. As an artwork, we are vampires, angels, even newer concepts of fantasy like emo’s etc. Black Metal is the very notion to crawl into fantasy without -or mostly- abstaining of any actual affirmation of ones credentials. But the modernist philosophy threw mythology, religion, beauty, into fiction. Which is the vault where we can take it out again. The sparce remainder of what was left, is deemed normality. Which the pleb gratefully consumes. We must foremost, crystalize something other then bacterial subjects living as parasites. Therefore as religion was psychotic, the world must be led by the psychotics with the psychotics. As this rule it must be through arts. As this rule goes it is merely insane and has not political or moral affiliation. All there is to know, as it goes, that times and esthetics change, and there will be no debate about that as our philosophy is change and as our theories we have created this age in mutilating and denying our own prophecy and prophectic natures into that solipsism. Then we will be insane again as the prophets and have no reservation when what we are and what we say is what we create, then we will only be measured by what there will be, and not by what we say. That is as much as Schopenhauer considered reality not a very solid word to describe a working ticking clock. What we say does n’t need to make sense. As long as it creates a massive change.What we say does n’t matter, time will tell how massive reality and words, so irrational or self indulgent can be. In essence we deplore the society of ethics of futility and the lack of imagination and serenity of an overall tapistry of lack of beauty today. A discredit of the beauty and serenity as much as the hysteria of the vacuous and the new. We celebrate and wish to credit none other then farmers who feed us and to bid them respect whereas they are artisan and therefore artists as the foundation of all life. And we celbrate the labour which builds beauty and awe, who manufactures the sculptures with great agility and effort and sweat. We CELEBRATE those, there is nothing subjective about all that. No future mystery or perpetual mystery with which the bourgois or maniacal capitalist must blow up and scream about the salvation of the garbage spouting out of their stupid factory and with which the notion that everything is futile we must disrespect the most foundational, that disrespect for, with the alleviation of futiltity to the greatest hysterical attention becoming some kind of sirens of the delusional. We don’t need this family life at the core which is in all cases already useless considering no amount of new houses and family lives can be guaranteeed or are even naturally considerable or possible to fund or are possible to thrive. How can people who revered Christs life consider suddenly family life is the last refuge? And 2.1 children will be the solace of civilisation? You have stacked your children all over yes. Now let them rather gaze into a wealth of allegories that can be their life. To have children and be a merry family should be of little significance, so many will not have a family at all. So many will never sit idle by the stove and or cook and retire etc, this consideration is perverted, it should be central and a concern to the Christmass man alone. It was never central to an artist, who has demons to fight, not be some kind of domestic man?! Family life is the womb of life, not the end result, family life breeds those to go on adventure or choose their mission, not those who again in their turn choose a family life again?! At no point is this nihilism to drive us back where we started. All the same for evolution theory and anlytic sermons to biology. Use your imagination! And may that be the final lesson, that rationality itself will one day touch a delusion, it may not have dawned on you yet, but for an idle lazy mind to go to the length of the delusional, we have no time for them?!
As martial industrial as well goes, there is only militancy urged for beauty and artisan prowess and artisan creation of goods and arts themselves.The militaries are in effect growing into such proportions, that they become useless, decorative forces, they are payed, to be standing ‘there” resting armies, they are payed to be decorative. The classical pagan armies too, are decorative. And the revolution, will be decorative, it merely believes in art, therefore it merely protests and takes, for the sake of arts.
Therefore these decorative legions must support something that is not classic not individualistic but supraindividualistic. We do not consider the celebration of individualism is the current artistic and esthetic prowess, individuality does n’t work if all are measured to uselessness and lack of respect, or the oblivion or futility of what exists. Individuality thrives when all layers are respected, now the average is respected, not labour NOR the decadence of the arts. Everything in between and average is respected, nothing metaphysical nor essential, this was the erronous consideration of philosophers who propheted but of matter as the futile, and ever dug a deeper hole into their own brain.

"If the richest man on earth would tell all others what they needed to sacrifice to survive and surrender nothing of his own wealth, then this would still be a sound plan, now you could survive and have a way to do it. Justice does n't have the least bit to do with it. You could wonder what of his wealth you would really want for yourself. Or how many would want his wealth etc. Or how he could devide all that wealth to everyones further sustenance. But mathematically as materially all this "justice" and all these "arguments against hypocrisy" hold no water or ground whatsoever. Palaces and artists do not feed people, farmers feed people. Palaces and artists are the luxureous parasites on farmers, but anyway the tastes of my audience would hardly entertain much other interests, me myself i regret all has been lost.


To digress once more away from and through the borders of reason, surrealism hence, we must retain again what the fantastic is, and what is in decadence useful against a bourgeois, that was always fighting the wars since long, a bourgeois, which is still in power today, even if it is called democracy. He who makes guns and not flowers will ruin his own country, he who welcomes guns with flowers will save his own country, and have an immaculate sardonic reprisal against a primates  drumming at the masses of  yesterdays reverence. The arts and creation will always win over the next day in glory, whereas wars will be the futilities of yesterday. We are not claiming hippie truths here, but there can be sardonic flowers on the tombstone of war, as there are many already layed there, but primates will forget the genius, and will make newer small minds from leftover art shards, where they once blew up the same stupidity, alas too late, but a criticism was there, and now, they have again us in concentration camps, and prepare for a whole lot of battle and armor rattling. Munitions and canon fodder, and most of them. Are not poets at all in need of a savior. This is why of course, nothing here shall be understood or be in need to get published.
Well i though DIVINE society thats A LOT to aim for but then again i was reminded i just wrote myself couple of weeks ago AN ART without DIVINE spirituality is no art as is proven today. Sooooo. Well there are a lot more calling for satya Yuga sooo. Thats going to happen. Then. HEGEL and SCHOPENHAUER as the dialectics of art would be what we need to CREATE as we as mankind do nothing with SOCIETY then doing CREATIONS. Basically we should n't be aimless and consider buildings theaters oceans etc more as ART! ...and as it is; RECOGNIZE composition in them and the composition we made and the composition we unearthed and need to fix at a higher level, and architecture and ecological architecture will be of highest importance. THEN we also need Mars and Venus terraformed for the growing factory we can't stop. It DOES have a purpose. Hahhh. I suggest we build all RUSSIA, AFRICA, ARABIA, CHINA, AUSTRALIA and SOUTH AFRICA a capitol HILL and a FEDERAL RESERVE BANK for more convenient trading, this trading would then be ECOLOGICAL supermarkets with gardens on top and below and FLOATING pools etc. ARTISAN ATELIERS in stead of shopping avenues. For the population we must also face we have now various cosplay distinct species as there are and i introduce here ELVES ANGELS VAMPIRES MEDIEVAL JOAN OF ARC LEGIONS BLACK METAL EMO's AMONG others. For which all DECORATIVE and befit architecture can be built as of today. Or tomorrow, considering you were still sleeping when I wrote this. But certainly NOT the day after tomorrow.
"When thinking about subjectivity, and in this the past 200 years, you can ask yourself, did you LOOZE subjectivity or did you GAIN it. I think we can safely say it is the prior. None of these of beauty or the frivolous, eloquent or majestic, have fallen as such for the masses, and what is at the end of the masses?"
When everything would be subjective some people or a lot would magnify and strengthen to a point of absurdity the hysteria and joyfullness in diar or hypocritical circumstances, therefore not everything is subjective as people would just tout and snot a planet to the point of extinction for their inferior personal sense of pointless and wastefull and abberent luxury.
Ahhhh death is an illusion, as life is an illusion, opposed to that as its funny, death we can't think it, touch it, etc. And to some extent our senses are an illusion so "life" is an illusion.
Sensory does n't apply which is strange.
As i had a white dove at my window i do believe in otherworldly spirit dimensions yes.
Well i hypothesise as you can't REALLY (as we live in "reality") ever know but thats the amusing, nothing of this work could have just come from my subjective crisis i was in. I got in it before some imagination pulled me out, and spiritual effects.

I philosophize about a corridor of mirrors running through reality to intervene
I can give you some ideas on how spirtuality could work, as a hallucinogenics apparently was still in society, to scout for some mysterious reality, a way OUT?!
I consider you can't tell anyone WHAT the imagination is
But surely there are more serious imaginations then fiction and entertainment?!
so what one believes should n't be rediculous either.

I believe in Schopenhauer and can rightfully say the meaning of life we need to look for in art and that goes for all people not just a genius for that reason that art IS God. By means of deleting God from the equation you can see what happened to art. Controversial now. Least then its popular, the media can’t stop speaking about it, to educate anyone in believing it you need to pass through several psychotic walls before you end up back in classical times, where indeed I have fallen.
As there is little else today then art which would still be meaningfull art can be like, watching, singing, dancing, getting a cow out of the meadow, keeping flowers, hahhh, under awareness and joy all is possible to MEAN something.
"Imagination and beauty to the subject, but this culture does not leave it to the subject, it force feeds sloth filth and garbage and drivle and babble, we gobble it up, and we want MORE, as there is no solution. No solution? The only thing not apart of this society is this manifest. You will find most things you say relate to it somehow, defaitism, all are paralyzed, all are dumb. These things are what 99 percent of people think today. The only people probably who think the masses are intelligent are ironically the rich, who work for them. Who sell them the earth."
Here is a wide and extencive comprehensive manifest on the poetry of life, it is bound to touch upon politics as it is kind of trading off and bickering and pulling apart the whole earth. But it is not in essence political, it is spiritual
Politics is tearing the whole planet apart. Not surprising then that spirituality and beauty as we are we should take up some responsability. Not taking that responsability is kinda a subject religion or hedonism which clearly has become itself a religion, is all over politics and it is outdated.
That the nation state, ancient local cultures, or pagan beliefs or religion are relative to the universal spirit and to darkness does not mean they do not exist on one hand nor does it mean they should exterminate all other life for it on the other hand.


A nation or a subject alike should n't have to comply to an uneducated herd hysteria or irony nor should an individual subjects morals mean more to anyone but being a confirmation of an affect opposed to another affect, by any means to state moral judgements would n’t be necessarily more wrong or right then the affect itself, of which rather the morally judgemental affects are the most superficial. To consider the opinion is a matter of generosity, and mutual assured and evolutionary intelligence. However hysteric, and mainly, uneducated people today never really mean or are able to claim much in a world where to seek education is terribly easy. We consider the masses opinions today as irrelevent deu to greater matters and not in the least problems As in literature found those of Kant, Sade, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, HArtmann, Marx, Mainlander Foucault and the Surrealists among others. Most present day banality is utterly unaware of the significance not in the least do they still still meander on the philosophy of these grand ideas, but right now, by this manifest recalled and entirely reasserted ideas.

"when it was to the populace equality, brotherhood and a very well stuffed free lunch liberty, to the artists, the philosophers, the dreamers, the sensitive, the poets, and those who do not need anything or want some principled faith, it was melancholy, dread, despair, militancy, perserverence, intelligence, vision, and principles more peculiar to the populace i might imagine. None the less, when you read this, you who are intelligent, modernism has fallen."
Cyclones or no cyclones, money or no money, we need to race for the exit, they are all bullshitting us here people, seven billion politicians, we need the ones below who are one in a hundred and spread all over the place, the 99 we don't need they can babble on twitter for the rest of eternity.
"Mankind has everything in common, namely TWO things, beauty, and space travel, that that is a grand CONVENTION is contested in every crack of this society, plain for everyone to see, one needs just dig up all the boulders of the past 200 years of society, and see that mankinds solipsistic cell in which he sits CONVENING on the subject problem of Immanuel Kant, is already realized."

"We hold it for self evident that ALL imagination and ALL beauty is to the discretion of each subject, none the less, if he does not TREAT of his own will to that a power to influence, to him remains NOTHING but insanity. I have been there, and now i open the flood gates of my own influence, and may you be another stone to open the flood gates to your own influence."
"When a person was in a finite space and had a soul and lived there and started to grow bigger then it would seem fit for something to provide it with a lid to come off and have some extra room. Eventually. Now if a child is in a womb you would think it matures to such an extent that it could at once survive in the outer world, for mankind to be a child or ready to survive in space is considered. That it matures as much and stays in the womb and eats the resources is impossible considering there IS balance and humanity IS somehow a baby. -We have clearly seen it is a baby.- But when there is a baby usually there IS a balance. You could consider maybe there is thousands such babies in the universe and we are one that sort of failed to form correctly. But that would just be a lack of principles and a cheap excuse, we have ALL the possibilies and we MUST make it and we CANT fail and THAT is how EVOLUTION would THINK... IF you would actually THINK. No line of infinate children on infinate gardens on infinate planets CAN be wasted, it is impossible!!


The "new" is a hype, furthermore "new" in form does n't even exist. The romans did what? The same for how many years? Classic reality did what? The same for how many years? Why would n't it be possible to have Satyricon make 12 Dark Medieval Times? The medieval days did what? How many cathedrals? You seek refuge from character into a quick fix, and its superficial. Quality is schewed and scoffed, nothing is right other then some fleeting trivial idea, gimmicks and effects. Because hey. "Evolution theory" Spawn of the latest is always the best. NO, we say NO. It ends in minimalism and TRIPE!!"
The only new that ever was is quality that lasts forever, and resumes a newer form only in reassesing what was and in its form it will be the next image of this reality. But "new" does n't exist, as much as it is ONLY the idea mania and definatly a religion today, it can ONLY count as innovation, and rather then to defend it as innovation, we can reply to them it also looks like a caricature of itself.
It ends also in the human body and nature not being respected and for that matter nothing being respected.
You wonder how many people are already removing my visionary text as an accusation towards modern subjectity on their part because "you not citing this, you are patronizing, you are this that not referring to this you need to fill this out, this that, mark here, fill out your name properly; you are self indulgent, this has not this, it is so i don't understand etc etc etc" VISION, knows, no greater people, it knows equals, or it knows only smaller people. In that here referred to the accursed poets, who are in to solve the matter, understood by no one but themselves and other poets. And that VISION knows only equals or fools is definatly one of my own. You can be equal to this, you can be a fool to this, but don't contest to be churning and growing in against the shell with an industrial machine, indeed a factory of people and goods, without KNOWING It, here i give you a chance to know it. Leave me in peace (and my peculiarities too in peace)."



MAnifesto CHAPTER APHORISMS

AYRIS MANIFESTO

It is reason, not just reason, our hands, meticulous, that gather up skill to make this image. And when we equate the image to reality, we find to our excitement and also to our greatest terror, reality holds onto comparison. Hence that image, imagination, and the quality of it, should n't be scoffed with rubbish. And there we enter the realm of philosophy, art and technology and inevitably space travel.


"It is modern times one and only aqcuisition left, "subjectivity" under which the masses got a carte blanche to consume away the planet and debate moderatly about it, and secondly, under which the woman refuse to be vain and frail solely, they are "subjects" now. And if you said they were woman, they would be offended. Thus we conclude that Kants Critiques is all a bunch of hogwash to begin with. And that there never was individualisation or subjectivity or anyone thinking for themselves as he recommended, there was just a lot of polarization, and as freaky as religion is, we can see all mankinds monkeys and serpents and elephantus and hippopotamus, coming out of the woodwork nice to meet you, we are the lonely melancholic panthers. You have n't heard of us before."

If christ innovated the idea for mankind being touched by the imagination from below, spinoza reconsidered that, that you could be so touched, or his divine status, but the same imagination and the same teaching it eventually is, to the prophet imagination should always be divine, or it is not its most powerfull, so we can say it is not with divine power the world is ruled, it is rather with faith we resolve the void with divine art. The imagination has gone to horror and fantasy since the enlightenment. But it is still the same imagination. Now we will resume culture! So rather then Spinoza deafening Christ, he had deafened the imagination. They all brought the wrong accents. With that accent if you want to take it further, you can effectively not find your way out? Atheism is a dead end as you would identify the absolute deity not to exist, whereas you postulate that it is ALL there can be and you refuse it ANYWHERE?! If anywhere an atheist would develop his own religion other then be a parasite on someone who believes in any kind of faerytale whatever will it or should it bother him you think of it that way. Devise some of your own faerytales or myths, i have already started, but by no means do i have so much problems with imagination, serenity or classical values. I am ALL ABOUT classical values, and then again I have read Sade. Its like WHATEVER.

Considering i just said that, there happen two things. ONE, your babble becomes unmaintainable. TWO, your world becomes entirely empty?!

To inspire, to be a weight on the dead subject, to be a surplus to the ecology. That is finally the intent. We seek a composition of the earth where mankind is not just an atom, which is a mere denial of his sensory features, and his intellect. No greater the monkey that realized it was a monkey, when he looked back and realized in the past he thought himself so much more. We got off course. Recognition, something you might not respect, but something set in stone that you just can not break. That too is to credit a divine quality, not to settle for a rodent quality, as that too is the creed of rodents, who do not merit a divine quality. Where there was a quality of the divine, it was diminished as non existent, and art degenerated because of it. We see it within art, this divine beauty must be at once again evoked in a profound way. And why would we need this, "new" which is merely a new form of expression, but of which all kinds have been tested, to merely concentrate on the new now is not enough, this technique must once again render the human body of some worth. For that we need to reassert that everything is an object to a subject, and we can not know what is a commonal object. We have reduced all so much so to icons, yes the world is so small now. And all the richess of form and cultures is gone. So much more so BECAUSE this subject thread throughout the past 200 years, if we take it out there would still be plenty of opportunity. Alas, We ascended to Schopenhauer, we could not get out, so we ranted like Nietzsche, and still we could not get out. Ever further back. And ever ranting, how could you have abandoned all in these arts? But after Schopenhauer, only insanity is left. Try find a way out now. Further back. Hesiod yes. Form some allegory. And why then would we need to those, who ever so tire us with this "is n't that to each differently" What is it then to you. Why are we locked with these who have just picked up these subject threads but have for themselves nothing to say? Now we can only in general attain that it is NOT subjective, as we need to agree on something clearly, and that needs to be simple and just a few lines with which we can always march forward. Well, there are a few lines here who attempted to walk out of modernism. If i want to make it known to most people I am not entirely sure, I always knew i was a rotten, dispickable creature, and because of old age i become even rotter and more dispickable. We have been. We are a lot that in an artisan life have n't rephrained any amorality and sin. And it is with greatest virtriol I expect myself to be received and poured over by each their ounces of sulphurous saliva, how could I please have the strength of their opinions, and dance as they do on my suffering corpse?! If there was anything established, is that I could not hold a classical philosophical truth to be left unanswered with another. That I mainly talked back to the modern inclination to dwell in this subjectivity problem. Is a disease, yes, it is an abyss. In which i definatly staired. Now then I can no longer dwell there with my pittifull person, my smothered pride, my own trodded down nobility as an artist. In making a breach with mankind, what peace have n't I found? To unchain myself from modernism? Why are we still eager to be part of these torture devices we call modern social intercourse? We have not the idleness of the new, and its effect, not the screams of the underground, not the screams of left, right, or heaven to endure, we are, effectively nowhere. We are considering, a chandeleer, or a sculpture, or perhaps technology enrobed with old woods. Where would we be if we do not believe in the new? Not wrecking, and vesting, and earthing ourselves into the form of the old? Ever it became more trivial, now mere the form of the old is left. So we exult in form. Cream, nutrients within our food; philosophy; there are none left. Kitsh. Substance in it, they have gutted any kind of premisse to assault them, to be granted even odds against the new. Yes the lack of hope and meaning, is certainly present here as we mean to sink back into the past. The hysteria of the new in abstence of something. Something profound, where we have grown so accustomed to metaphyics, the notion that it would n't be there. Is now all the more pugnent. Yes regression, to build a meaning out of form, is the only thread that was left for myself. And is that subjective then? No it never was, subjective never existed. if you would have an opinion you would have something I could treat of right here. but there is no whipped cream in just that, you had no opinion. I found my own schizophrenia, long after i was deemed a schizophrenic, i could never fly away, if it was n't for these, so called, catalytic exteriorisationeffects. I can not expect to be alive for much longer, i fail to see how i can have faith in them now. I had faith, extremely religious as I am, and extremely aware of the modern problems in metaphysics, i do not wish to shine any light for those who do not want it. I do not wish this to be reviewed in a negative way. Soon enough for me and for my kin they are steps I devise to climb upwards, i do not want to be yelled at and shouted at, I would trip, fall back in all this, plethora of unsubstantiated. Maybe this form, this weight, is all I needed to be at peace, it does beg to be constructed by more classical things, self indulgent, vanity, eager to phrase in, well; a baroque. Where else do my forms sustain themselves then in full rich greasy dashes, existence, rather then the analysis of existence, the concept of existence as a show, that no one should be interested in. Mankind is a social creature, I too wanted to be part of the debate. But i found none but equally dispickable creatures. Not loathsome, but somehow chastid and full of ethics, Sade too is an abyss, which I absorbed. In your modern ways of reason, which goes into every direction, you will have proven him right. And in the excess of your system, your capitalism, and your lazyness to concider beauty or the composition of flowers with a stem, manure among their root, and clean fresh flower. This society has turned it clearly upside down. You are clearly obsessed with Sade. you are obsessed with shit and vulgarity. It is in this very environment I can not assess ideals, nor find my own, more trustworthy and generous kin to have a conversation with. You have stolen the Media! Where should i go? Banish us all rather. We are better off somewhere where you can not see us. Again, Nietsche, he would think of me, he would scoff me now. And Nietzsche then? Would I not invite you to the mythology I wrote, to many of these pages below where i still considered to speak? But no more. My pretty petty song has been pretty petty sung.

The cities have lost their shine, they have become ghettos and colors and forms melt into a worn out smudge, nothing can be identified anymore, everything becomes part of the garbage, so we relish in pure symbolist beauty, not for the masses, but for those fewer underground, we mean to find eachother through these means and books and illustrated magazines of worth. Printed as classical as possible. With a staged classicism, as dignified out of the humility we are given to use by modernism and the modern means of humiliation and their voices. We move not from the classic to defy the ironies of the masses, we move from the ironic to the classic, we stumble, we fail, but ever more serious about beauty we become. Educated in the clumsyness of modern life, like some new religion, something undone by any myth, perpetually infantile, maturity and beauty lies way back from all that exists today. Nothing we can do today can contribute to anything worthwhile, there is no criticism or it will assume more culture, there is no ideal possible apart of it.



To go beyond the jumbling it all up in subjectivity, and to conjure a grand sceam of composition for the earth, its cultures and its ecology. Its not that you leave that up to science, communism, nor kapitalism, with allegory, spirituality MUST be realized. If we do not live for the arts and composition, if mankind is not means to an end, then they consider, life must be utterly futile, and so it created the greatest fraud, the greatest church in history, out of uselessness, because artists and intelligence and authors surrendered their rights. But the system clearly fails, and swallows everything. The masses who stood raising their hands for dictators, are now eager to consume. Another demagogy. And its called by some of mediocre intelligence "this societies norms and values". And was it not written? Was it not exactly what the philosophers said it should be? Don't we laught at the bibles modesty. And laugh at the vanity of leaders and kings? Do we have anything left?

I know not of anything I have written before, as below these lines but one thing. People who are, without generosity, without curiosity. And think this world is self evident. WILL BE CRUSHED, with or without me. And with them who do have generosity and curiosity, and who look standing on this age as any age apart of a longer thread, passing by, and utterly redundant compared to the past only, do I share a consent or a friendship. Yes if you are within this world, and are incapable to pass out of this world, i bid you farewell. I bid you, i have nothing in common with you. Your debates sicken me. Your culture is resenting, it stinks to me like the enormous pile of stinking garbage, oozing fumes filthy and sticky like tentacles, trying to lash on to everything and pulling everything in its stinking oraphus. People who scream or push others, run over others to be first, or resent to be last, people who like to be famous, or people who dread to be alone. Those people i could not care less about. Mainly, also. People who feast on the crisis of irony. Irony here described as a feature, coming after humour. The irony is always there, it is omnipresent, i am allergic to it, irony and as it is described in the machine here. Is an imbecility, it is superbly modern; it could not be other then highly developed and enhanced by the internet. Irony is the opposite of serenity. You can't breathe you can't admire beauty in it. Irony is the modern clown, the hysteric, who comes to trouble us as we are in a classical museum. As you know the two don't mix well. This is a truth like no other, modernism and classicism don't mix well, the hysteria of all these amused sheep, laughing at serenity; and constantly finding newer rediculous arguments, possible just reversing what you just said, this squeeling of amuse over anything solid or a prowess, a might or a decorum. This is the irony we are allergic to, and the irony which we can not stand. In some worlds I considered myself closest thing to a wrancune, and thats the closest thing to a dark demonic knight in reality. Its very kitshy perhaps. But that does n't mean I concur to all things being just a regular turd. There are vast color arrays in turds, you may notice it in your whole course through your arguments, me myself i would try a flower, or a dove once for an argument. And then enjoy that. That would be something worthwhile. To smear shit over all doves arts or all doves or butterfly arguments, is modernism. And I don't like it.

It is a great recommendation to those people trampling spouting up everywhere, and who do not reach for the stars, but in so many a deplorable way mean to a limited existence and a limited little treasure, limit your life more so, do not limit others for material values, you are making yourself miserable among a whole flock of angry claws, clasping for this momentary treat, be it goods or fame. Yes there is an ethics in esthetics, for what passed people did, for what the artists did. A way that in this era, you have to shake off your beliefs, steer back, settle in the calm waters of artistic delight of a more decorative time. And not in the least, in these murky waters today, one must be a flower of stone, or a heart of cancer.


To be very honoust, if you are not any Holderlin or Cellini or the like, this manifest was probably not for you. I resent having to be part of some, discrete or otherwise modest debate in the mainstream. Or bump into its easily provoked voices everywhere. So soon as you produce content you get some breed, probably developed from some kind of nihilism that only death and stupidity is good. Anything else is bad. These are just some threads, a long time ago absurd, recently more moderate, not necessarily more succesfull in trying to stop the screams of the mainstream in ones head, but always trying too break through the hysteria, for myself, for my kin, to develop a theory regardless. Those voices in my head, constantly laughing about every eloquent thing i would attempt, i have left them behind, gladly. It would only provide the force energy and might to someone who ended up having to live here, to detach and sink back as I did. Finding inspiration and the worth of that again in a previous era, or in the subtler or be it more grotesque arts today. A symbolist, always provocative to most, would n't mind making the whole culture look like a sixteen year old girl. A poisonous beauty. In his incapacity he might manage to make it look like a 20 year old girl. But a symbolist is no mainstream person who suffocates the world in this garbage, we wash our hands in innocence, yes as far as that is conserned. This is not what we consider normal. We do regard this as democracy. To have each ones tastes and impulses satisfied in an ever growing series of rediculous products, in which the masses are swept for some reason of subjectity anxiety, having no other ethics then sustainence to rely on as, through subjectivity this -anything but the new and hysteric, to consume, technology, to debate- was gradually denied to be important. A basic comfort of life is for long achieved, not having to pluck berries and hunt a deer yourself as an artist needs some amount of culture and preferably city life, does not mean we have to agree with the exponential growth into modernism. We consider chokers, latex and spacetravel the only uselefull things in modernism. The rest is not necessary. We suffice in some poor backward European land, abandoned castles and church ruins everywhere, eating artisan foods without it coming wrapped in condoms. Etc, if you would see that as your ideal, do consider to read on. To strengthen your mind into a neosymbolist hyperesthetics and hypersensuality. We would n't be part of this world at all. If not for our kin among you is lost. We must be so brave to challange a lot of idiots to find the few, frail, insane, occasionally modest or reasonable, yet inspired and passionate, for the inspired and passionate to be greated with a friendly voice, that is what we mean to do here. There is none more tedious and hostile world then the mainstream, of conservative and disgruntled, utterly frustrated hardly aware, of the usual moderate intelligence, which is a disaster to us. How do we know not to embarass us, or to offend them when we are among them? Yes likely in offending them we are still embarassed, it just never works out.

To the world then, we would have only this to say. if meat consumption somehow is unergonomic and wastefull. I have surely seen many other products in stores being unergonomic and wastefull. In fact the adds for them do not stop. In fact the very mountain of adds i get through my mail box all in itself should stop. I'm not going to put a sticker on my mailbox, i'll gather the mountain of stupidity, i could n't make it big enough. So to the world. Get an artistic board, evaluate use and quality of a product, and stop making it, there is no reason for your workforce to work, produce goods that need to be made again after 5 years, closets that break down, as far as a closet is even necessary. As far as it is, "just there" and not wholly esthetically becoming I have no use for a closet myself. You can put clothes in a corner on the floor. If that is not the minimum you could do then there is no use for idealism. Idealism however, we will discuss here among ourselves. You do not have to be apart of this nor is it in any way directed to you. If you accidentally stumbled in here and don't actually realize what is going on. We who are ourselves the rich, as we have our own produce of the arts, and we who are ourselves the elite, since the elite abandoned us, and wants fifty IKEA kitchens in their mansions, our paintings are no longer good enough, they are not, "new".

That we should all be valid or invalid as apart of the consensus of a society is somehow crass if you consider we are all subjects. I do not consider myself part of society. Nor could i ever be valid in that society. I presume i am hated and loathed by most. Forgotten by an even greater segment of that society. I do not exist. I do not have to begin to exist here, play your games, watch your tv, bicker in your debates on popular sites. Anything you do is in vain, that is not an attack, you can be guaranteed we are waiting untill mass consumption is over. For the powerfull to amass richess, and the artists will be there in droves, finally to build an imagination cathedral of some kind, as was proposed here. Untill you had all you could suck up. And then there will be an artisan reality again. These synthetic cities, houses, and artworks were a waste. We were not part of it. Nor do we henceforth need to be responsable for the whole species swelling up like a balloon. Some of us have always been here, and will always be here, I am already dead. let this be of a passed voice, or of a future, youthfull voice. Perhaps less of a parasite then now, but regardless of me, not moving, hardly consuming. We were always the parasites. We leap free from specimen to specimen, we are ugly, and we suck ourselves full of our hosts blood.
It is not by any means given to most of you to be parasites. You live in your social event, you are a socialite to a socialite, i spoke to you before, you drift into these social reminiscences of a regard, owh my how little regard, there is no hope for me in your society. To bicker or speak of the weather, indulge. To treat yourself to a nice party or a pleasent trip. We need to make our own truth here, we have no debate to be part of, we write our own theory, which is and will always seem self indulgent to you. Who have so eagerly spoken to many, or who are eager to explore fame. It is only by means of a common DNA of language, that Sade and Schopenhauer still speak, but alas, they are not really speaking to you. So leave this place behind. You are not really speaking to us. All hope is lost here. Leave this place behind.

One can be self indulgent, and gaze over this whole concoction of a planet, a culture, and consider you are worth something. And life should be rich and beautiful. Or you can indulge in the earth in this and with this society. Eventually creating nothing. Sucking it dry. And spit on self indulgent minds, laying on your beach, drinking soup in spain.
"if that what is above me is vast, powerfull and great, then i am truly great as I know myself"
Last warning, where I treat I would be a prophet or moderatly impressed by having catalytic exteriorisationeffects realized around me, now then I have nothing else to think about. And deu to the criticism of Kant, trod on fields never before ventured, likely then to those who understand 200 years of philosophy and have some oversight; I will be a prophet, as kant was, As Schopenhauer as much as Winckelmann and Baudelaire, Lautreamont and Breton were. That we consider this now again in some wholy classic light is only a measure of which I find myself highly aware of. Intelligence usually delves up something, and did I stumble upon something. It was Michel Foucault who finally pointed me out of the era and leave it to rot, as it leaves me to rot, that I would be anything as a prophet for these people is then in doubt. But that does n't matter much. When everything is subjective I should be a prophet as much to myself for a start, that is entirely plausible. Lesser geniality has said this. But from the perspective of where I see myself, yes, I am way back, and writing history all over again. Projecting a future thousands of years long in this new system. So. A prophet. In a very practical sense of the word. I also rephrain of modern writing, as its impossible to maintain for myself, as far as it was always impossible to maintain, if you see my earliest writings you can see in going back a few hundred years I only became more natural and peacefull.
It would be noted that I am first and foremost a classical decorative sculptor, and author of a classic decorative mythology. Hence, i can be considered an artist in the classical sense of the word. That I am not an artist in the modern sense of the word is perhaps anachronistic, but not unduly considering a development not noted in the mainstream, not the mainstream considered in the modern fixation on the so high and shiny innovation of today, that Academic depiction still exists in motion picture or music album covers. It would be considered that my Idea of a pagan market selling vegetables in a art gallery is the last and first of conceptual art projects possible. And a whole new beginning, that no one apparently is capable to understand that is very sad, and paramount to how religious and closed minded you really are. And how you rise one value, and fail to see the very simple truth in Van Gogh and Leighton or whomever. Its always the same. The values of art are redundant without counsciouss, hence the counsciouss of money means very little to what it is. Merely something which changes form in the mind of a poet, a culture, which he destroys or innovates at will. And then. A van Gogh is NOT worth so many millions. Nor any other work. It is on the contrary your money that is growing less in value opposed to the minds of some brilliance, and opposed to my artworks, your money is unsurmountably unvaluable. It is cheap, it is not art. Therefore it can never stick to any of these arts, and i can introduce one of the key lines herein, one can only own where one walks, paradoxically I also claim. If the world is almost dead, you own the whole world, not just your own backyard. Because your backyard, is where the resources of the earth are stacked, the masses own the whole world yes. And the leaders are a shining example of sufficing peoples mountain of garbage in their backyard. As far as i know, i was collecting old wood, living on candle light, trying to find honoust food. I am in no way part of your society for the longest time. You threw all my art and my old wood collection and artisan nails etc away, threw me in psychiatry again, and shoved yet another IKEA bed under me, and you repeated this over and over again. I don't have to treat of this philosophy no more in practice, now its up to YOU to understand it. I already understood it for quite some time. Equally detrimental then I would say. If a government leader is in charge for 1 year or so. The life of the culture is also about 1 year now at most. So you OWN the decay, unless you SOLVE the decay, and then you need to do something quite different then keep the socio-economic order entirely. Paving money for it will not amount to much. You can pay 400 trillion dollars for a Van Gogh, its still just a Van Gogh, to me, to him, to anyone, don't get your hopes up. Whatever empires you are building, they are part of a dogma instilled by philosophers, and now i'm glad to say, i will bash it all apart. The last ounces of what was left of this world. You will grow insane, or you will see the planet in pristine condition and develop a worthwhile economy, thats it. No more bollocks.

Little bravery in me then came back to this, early in the morning and two days no sleep i geuss. The hords of stupid checkmated by the few pennyless artists.
These notes are not things offered as apart of debate, they are song lyrics for the upcoming Principii Titanium Opera in which they will be entirely incomprehensable, so as to fit in with the crowd.
These lyrics may not apply to Empress who want to lead the world, or girls under eighteen, they might not apply to anyone, it may be just an arts, as a banner of a new state, fresh, innocent, gleeming with its new found ambitions and creeds. But It may not apply to gold star lesbians either, of which have been known in satanic netherworlds, to conspire with me in palaces, and treat of a world entirely different if it was conceived by dreamers, and run by woman.
THIS IS NOT FICTION! FICTION IS OVER!!
Now, for 1111 liv tylers, they will be known, EVERY useless product, evaluated as such by THEM and a board of artists, plastics etc, fitness, closets, etc, all this consumption bullshit, will be instantly stopped to be produced, in stead we will concentrate on WHATEVER WE GOT, TO GET CITIES ON MARS; now you are STUCK, because you can NEVER DO that, without my 1111 secretaries, excuse me, noble elves who rule the world in their palace. YOU CAN NEVER DO THAT, WITHOUT ARTISTS, and yes, coca cola bottles are more usefull then most things you have at home. IF THERE IS SOCIAL AND KAPITAL as two main items today, which is the left and the right today. THEN THERE IS ALSO A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER. DO NOT PRETEND LITTLE CHEWING BALL PLASTIC TO MASTURBATE YOUR FACE IS PART OF SOCIAL MARXIST NECESSARY SUFFICE THE MASSES, so socialists can never make the economy WORK. Kapitalists in that respect cant' make the economy work either, for the same reason, that this to suffice and make profit will destroy the earth, all your billions of attempts regardless. YOU ARE DOOMED. So we here re evaluate, everyone gets A BIT of food, to be knownst some bread water and cheese, standard, You can shelter wherever. THE REST IS UNDER SCRUTINY AND EVALUATED BY THE BOARD HERE!!! UNDER THE ARTISTS LEADERSHIP. YOU MAY CONSULT ME. I HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO; ME ON CONTRARY TO YOU. I HAVE ACTUALLY NOTHING TO DO AND NOWHERE TO GO?!! I AM AN ARTIST YES. AND INSANE TOO, MENTALLY DISABLED SO I DONT HAVE TO BEG MUCH.

Basically if you look at it one way, the way everyone looks at it right now, is that you live in the capitalist struggle to survive, you need your car, to shove adverts, to have people buy goods, to make money for etc. But if you WERE individuals, which you are not, but will be, then YOU are responsable for the shit you do. YOU produce ten cars a year, YOU pollute the WHOLE planet with your car for your useless commutes, YOU sell people shit by putting adverts, YOU make worthless money selling people shitty products, and buying more shitty products with it. In short YOU ruined the whole artisan reality. And still throw entire shiploads of antiques away every day; because you also wanted ikea, etc, and you STILL want a new bathroom etc. And TURKEY then recently had IKEA and etc threw all antiques out. THAT is a carbon foot print. Of which i have NONE, no car, no transportation, no clothes, just a chain maille, a sword, accidentaly some garage i'm stuck in, but i would be walking and battling, if it was n't you are even too stupid to understand why i would wack your head clean off. I gather old wood in 2002 and threw away all the plastic back then. I never consumed a single thing anymore. But for some condom wrapped saussages and a new tshirt, and i never got into those plastic shoes anyway i still have all my war boots as far as someone else keeps throwing things away. I DID NT THROW ANYTHING AWAY BUT SOME COCA COLA BOTTLES AND CONDOMS BECAUSE I HAVE NO ARTISAN REALITY AROUND ME.
that as much, is all your society can accuse me of. And if you double down, i will too. And live EXACTLY like in medieval days; See how much carbon foot print i still have. bit of bread and meat, i just outright leave the plastic in the grocery store. Or seek refuge in Italy all together. A POOR country? With your berzerk notions you even DARE to call "poor" countries "poor" countries, because they don't have supermarkets and highways stacked everywhere and not a labour force working for redundant products but rather sitting idle in the sun its POOR?? YOU people are BERZERK??!! And THAT, is why there is projected a need for infinate growth on a finite planet; FAITH, RELIGION. NOTHING ELSE. You and every businessman and consumer are as CHRISTIAN as THE POPE. You have NOTHING. Put THAT on your stock exchange notifications and your newspapers. Owh I can be Van Gogh, its my grand conceptual artwork for you. "YOU HAVE NOTHING" write it on your newspapers or on your money and sign it YOURSELF. Now you can ALL be as BIG A BUM AND LOSER AS ME. AN ARTIST, WHO WANTED TO MAKE A CLASSICAL SCULPTURE IN THIS TIME?! AND FOUND HIMSELF A LITTLE OUT OF DATE. The problem is the best artists are also the philosophers, and any artist is also a philosopher, they don't actually believe time, they CREATE time. But the mainstream, is BELIEVING TIME.
So Sade, Lautreamont, Schopenhauer, i absorbed them, could n't agree more with them. The time for genius to debate among eachother is OVER, it was YOU who we needed to debate in the first place. And someone like them. Or someone like Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Rooseveld, i have yet to find one here in this puddle of mud, probably all rusting underneath, making fucking black metal. Even their conservative stances are ALL obsolete now. We are ALL the BUMS from Sade, scavaning the remains of TS ELIOT, and inducting upon EACHOTHER pretty much the control state of 1984, because artists WROTE IT, now the artistic in my own angular aproach, is to WRITE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, and for your further notice, that is called INNOVATION, be it a thousand or twothousand year passed style of innovation. If I bloody well choose to put a pharao fricking hat on, i will get more serious at it, while you keep thinking everything, me, yourself and the universe, is rediculous; THAT IS your doom. THis society is full of you.

I am myself the tool of many sadistic practice. I may instruct you that all life is suffering, from vegetative to instincts to motivation to genius. if you are truly a buddhist, you but out of polarizations, and mourn for my terror upon animal or mankind whatever, then you don't deny there is a purpose in nature, on which you feast. Even breathing is consuming and being part of the suffering my friend, death is the only salvation, all in else in life is hypocrisy to claim otherwise, look at Schopenhauer. I am not against technology, as, A, it will help me to find someone intelligent, artistic, or militant which you can't phathom how far that goes, and B, technology is good for one reason, space travel, other then that, pluck berries, or to use your phrase "all modern consumer technology is space technology no matter how quaint the packaging." You did n't see that coming did you?

If Some Must Be Said For A Persons Cult It Will Be Mischief and Insanity, and Poems For Falling Star and Doves Coming To Windows Of Poets.

I have a right, as an artist, to sing of the one in the ten signs i found on the nine in ten roads to my oblivion where there was no macick or wonder for a poet to wonder and remote of this world, not to find that remotes of the world in signs.

piano
i invented a piano three days ago.
That would be enough
billions of people will play it one day
all across the universe
and i already cried at regular pianos
little did i know i would invent one


A thank you note written to a smoldering rock in the sky. WITH FOOTAGE
How a treasure to inform you someone just sat there enjoying anaehtheana at her late lonely nights and love and behold caught the falling star over it? I mean where would i be without having this footage and she happened to catch it. I mean i don't know what the miracle is here her catching the footage or having a star for Christ and a star for anaehtheana. it was a poisoned gift for hiM; Lets hope my gifts are n't poisoned.
second of the spiritual confirmed poems after apocalyps poem.
Its the first in its kind no one ever done a poem that confirmed a spiritual event and vice versa.

And the poem is.

You unbliguous masterpiece you star, you evil projection of my might beyond universal borders, i call you. MEGHELEKETH
Sent for the grey hairs not to any longer pull my hair, and your realm of spirits, that helped the loneliness of the first flowers of existence grown out of which all existed, and as she planted the flowers had to exist out of a flower and had to sow herself.
The COMET reality, was the first of a cascade of realities.
And that is how the ETherith Mythology ACTUALLY begins...


And Grand Opening of the Apocalyps Poem
How Beauty
Would it be.
If a throne was come to salvage.
Where is victims he would weep for first.
But they were eggs selected
and some did not like poetry
and some that did like poetry
will be restored and ressurected
but listening
was some to deaf ears
and think too much, they could hear

Apocalyps poem most beautiful salvaging of malign poems. PREMIERE I am a poet, have you heard my name. Not for insanity or deu cause i will unleash the apocalyps, but because i am a poet, and fight for dead prophecies of artists and poets, for i am an artist and a poet. And this prophecy, was an arm against stupidity the prophets could never predict, because they have no affinity with it. But it was needed at some point.



Quran Deviation
well it would be interesting to consider glass and crystal female deity and female angel and muse sculptures in Arabia since they don't like depictions then. I'm the philosopher dictator its a consideration i'm not actually going to send an army like i want my fucking sculptures, i don't actually even do that for oil i don't need oil exept for seeing visions of shieldmaiden dying in the gutter and admire the rainbows; IM A POET? HEARD OF ONE?

My sculptures are my perfect conversationalist partners, and a harem of crystal sculptures is even more favorite then that, and sculptures in antarctica with mirrors and angels carrying mirros in antarctica, and i even have such vanity that it only exists for that.


CHAPTER MANIFESTO HIGH DELUSION
Sure but thats just matrix talk, "you are the one, you are your own being" "do what you want" etc etc etc etc that is being shouted everywhere now its hollow, we need a decor too not just skyscrapers or civil mansions with civil people in it. YOU are yourself but your clothes are from China; so would n't you think SOMEONE in Europe with a proper artisan environment could create it. TO consume and to vote is to be in charge you could say. So WHAT do we create? "you are in charge, i do what i want" thats nothing. It needs content.
DO WHAT YOU WANT IS WHAT EVERY POP SONG SAYS?
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
REPEAT THIS CULT?
OR ACTUALLY TAKE RESPONSABILITY?
YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH FREEDOM TO ACT WORTHWHILE AND DIGNIFIED?!
If the artisan clothes or any vampire clothes are made in Europe, then we do not need the vampire clothes soon coming from China, it does n't have to be repeated. The economy with this example can die.

psychiatry is not science and fiction is imagination its the same as religion only with modern "do it on your own" morals and therefore devoid of morals or conjecture. Fiction was written by the "prophets" of the nineteenth century if you will, movie theatres replaced churches
TIME DOES NOT EXIST IN CULTURE SO ALL COSPLAY IS TRUE
you just need to know the paradox of science, in reality you create, be it with fantasy or technicality, science does n't exist. You create technology or you create esthetics, which esthetics wraps into it deities, which technology wraps into it today minimalism and asensory assertions. It became a cult of consumption, providing the masses with anyone who cackles loudest
YOUR MODERN WORLD IS A RELIGION. WHATS MORE ITS A MATRIX? WE GET THOSE OUT OF THE HIVES THAT HAVE SOME WIT AND CHARACTER NOW. THEY DONT WANT TO BE AMONG YOU.
WE HAVE COMPOSED FOR THEM
AN ANGEL FORTRESS CALLED ANGH? THE ANGELS OF ANGH WILL MARCH WITH SWORD AND CHAIN MAILLE AND ROMAN SANDALS TO ANAEHTHEANA
THE ELVIN A 1111 WILL DECIDE WITH A BOARD OF ARTISTS AND ECOLOGISTS WHAT THIS SOCIETY NEEDS AND DOES N'T NEED!! ALL OTHER JOBS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES? AGAIN? YOU ARE A RELIGION RACING TO THE ABYSS? THERE IS NO POINT IN YOUR SOCIETY? YOU ALL JUST COMPETING FOR SHIT;
WE OFFER YOU REAL SOLUTIONS? EVERYTHING FROM BANKS TO POLITICIANS TO JOBS IS PART OF YOUR STUPID LITTLE CONSPIRACY
ROMAN LEGIONS WILL MARCH TO THE AIRPORT IN BRUSSELS
ELVES ARMIES OF THE LOFTR MOVIE YES THEY MARCH AMONG YOUR STREES? WELL THEY ARE NOT FICTION ANYMORE
NOW THEY MARCH TO ANAEHTHEANA WHERE A CITY WILL BE BUILT FOR US? RIVENDELL WILL BE BUILT AND INHABITED? MORE USEFULL THEN YOUR STUPID SKYSCRAPERS

People are like teeth decay, indifferent, sadistic to you, but they are harmless bacteria that you should brush well.

"They said the pencil is a sword, but at no point became an author so much immortal and with his sword against a world, as in these writings, and the civilisation i destroyed with this, was more vast then any one empire. Therefore in these writings, and as long as i live, i will hold the most power, when i die, there will be nothing. I mediate for solutions with anyone, as i always have, or you all mediate for your doom, as you have tried to convince me of your doom, for over twenty years, it is literally all that is in your mind. You are death. I am life. You are unsuccessfull. I from the gutter, will rule, rather then with a thousand backstabbing and incompetent lackies. I will gather the competent, and the soldiers, and the artists, and your civilisation opposed to that and with your rule, is perpetually, shit, and you eat it, because you are wrapped already in hundreds of years of philosophers slime cocoons and conspiracies, and none of it was treu, they said it was n't treu. and what did you do? You considered it a religion. And that was you and your own FILTH"
When you read this thoroughly, the intelligent will know its in the bag. The black metal legions will probably be alerted and know its in the bag -if they ever actually read a fucking book-. WHEN you read this. And then Dead or alive, whatever i may be. I WILL have destroyed this puddle of waste and all its trivial debates. And have been on top of the matter.

When I am uninspired, usually under drugs of psychiatry, I am like you, getting fat, generally unaware of these writings, generally thinking society will procede as it does. Mind you however, that we reach linear upward trajectory however here, and everything you know right now is a lie.

Etherith the End Aeylyea Ellhe De Ellendeh·Thunder day, May you fall 7, the seventh 2019 the year of abolishing the apostacies in any wisdom. Well as we all are a little in anguish we have to play a part of Ephexian in this age, dance along with this decrepid empire, guided by all these delusions, just sitting there staring. I'm proposing we just guild our soothing in our hearts and relinquish our destined paths, that we get out of our hives for good and prosperous purposes. Now I have comprised a gothic vampiric avenue, which I composed, Its in Antwerp Belgium or Anaehtheana, i'm going to launch a vampiric crusade and have girls and a lot of the kinder Vampirefreaks to live in a communal Ikea and the more fancy gothics, of who'm most are not even here to reside in the more luxurous and private bedrooms and salons etc. EVERY GOTHIC AND METAL BAND IS CRYING FOR IT MORONS?!! We start at the Twilight and the sky turning black at a full moon coming in a few months. As I composed this play of Ephexian I also propose I'm the Vampyre Tyrant HAHH. Now who wants to play a cruel game with cats and made of cats. And please bring when we play this game of cats reality into ephexian and ephexian into reality don't just go all of unknown to myth on me. Its not unthinkable that some vampires are already checking the flights statistics and the reside properties and all that and it is not unlikely that the winner of this play of the cat, this umbilical theater, gets a free ticket from your location to the actual ECHECHEA Goddess of props and theater displays, she who is nearest and secondant to Hethreds realm of luxury. And a great stage and artisan gimmick cratfsmann Goddess. Where we play and will end up when the game of the Cat evolves. HELLO VAMPIRE DOMAIN. Now I PROPOSE at ALL times the ones who DONT want to do that will keep calling me the Vampire Tyrant, Vempey to artists, also out of role play or on other postal pardons and the likes. If you have a unearthed divine law breaking problem with that of notions, please baptize your teeth in battery acid and while you are at it, drink the whole vessel, as your probably the most small minded troll in existence, or a caniving bitch that needs her overies removed for the sake of her hysteria and ill will. The vampires have come around. FIRST was the Vampire messiah, one to respond to his cat play and boldly the Gods carried on with sprankle miracles, as it was the 310th about. But numbers and miracles don’t have so much in common. Nor spelling. Granted and a parchment in caligraphy by one of His artists. And he invited to the game two lovable creatures who indeed again invited two lovable creatures. Congratulations He has started vampirism for the future. WITH architecture to a level of supreme megalomania. The Vampire or, mighty as he was, not leniant to kitshy depictions of his ancestors Vhempeyhre, wrote... ON earth, at the center of reality. While Aeylyeaelle caged, and composing the Temples and composing with Him. The powerfull as He resides. never much undone, and comforting Aeylyeaelle, as He would get him out. And Aeylyeaelle surely had faith in a Vempire that would sent him a crow, a vampire crow plucked from a dead crow in the streets all scaffolded and twisted. caught by a chariots ebony and silver plated wheel.
I don't know anymore since they increased the dosage of Xeplion my preferred psychotropic angeldust for the fourth time. And now Impromen and Then Fluanxol. He kept provoking. Now he was a zombie. If He gets the least bit weak, or awake, He will fulfill none the less these in wretched dipped curses. Meanwhile if any wrecked Angel passes along don't hesitate to near my dreams in me I have been looking for you. And then fulfilled, the most stupid equally stupid things by the way, as they I hear RIGHT THERE in the supposed fancy and kitshy lifestyle ghetto. pfffff lauzy gothics, wait up, more coming this way, maybe it 'll improve some time. And there is hope there are indeed, a FEW, REAL, vampires cominggggg. I kind of just was here to accompany my profile with the kind of black surrealistic anti economic satanic effect. Seems I got a nice and kind understanding after all to see me through with this Portal? Well I have a lot of new art styles and you match quite a few of them hahahaha you would n't be unfit in my decors so. For his palaces he this Vampire also experiements with latex and chokers and punk upon classical sculptures. And also have beds with fighting angels and demons sculpted above and around it. glad to have someone to talk to in this underworld cheerfull salutes to you and hailed thou, never let me go to leave or miss me as my hearts intelligence a thieve? In all humility, a thing I am tactically not permitted to HAVE MODESTY the epitomy of cardinal sin according to light angel of love satanic beliefs EXPLAINED, and very simple it is. Meet me here my friends, an Elvin King, composed of an Elvin city, Wrackahoeaue DhavorieyavoviCk, dear friend of Satan of who’m both already had white doves at their windows, predicted or more or less sent out by Satan, as a sign of hope to him Sareahelle The angel of wonder and also the angel of temper, reigning apart of the Cathedral of Angh with a logo on her banner a “Lionsdale” Paradise Bird an entirely engineered Paradise bird with long yellow feathres in its collar, devised by a master of inventions the vampire, and a poem for Aeylyeaelle and a Hope to mischief of an Elvin King who could not understand a single factory or progress, as he believed he was an ELph, in a world where none smoked cigarettes, as a vampire would, where there were not even people with darker skin, Esephii, little Angel of wisdom, and The Ayris Academies that they started second pupil. May to become at 16:39 THE most imbecilic, stupid, and civil remark i ever heard, was probably the following sentence. “Owh do believe, when it propose is without future.” Ten yearsbefore or about seven or six to heave and keep the disgrace. And an yelled at the flocks and putrid stagnation, and the the vampiric and souls of mens tied and without their freedom, and he cast a spell. YOU WHO WANT NOTHING, YOU EXPECT to BE GRANTED A LIFE FOREVER AFTER ME AND KINGDOMS DEAD, and the EARTH DIES, WITH NATURE AND COUNSCIOUSS. WHAT AN ARTISTIC NIHILISM OF A DOGMA UPON YOU, AN EQUATION IS THAT YOU IF YOU WANTED TO BE CIVIL VERMINT; AND I CAST AWAY THAT SPELL FOREVER Now what did I do? I HAVE WAGERED TO CREATE EVERYTHING, I EXPECTED TO DIE AND HAVE DIED AS MY PORTAL WILL SAVE THE EARTH. and i would work my treasured gadflies and dagflies of my off of my plate or suash them if they did n’t serve me my purpose. This ill insect my guardians to death just for paying the in Autism all as born and a majesties correct brains i could not condone a programmer even if there is swiftly innerly torments as guaranteed I will not be speaking to myself AS I AM HERE, and be on my portal ALONE, and i don't GIVE A feature of love at last and at end of each wit. And that, is not a spiritual nonsense. IT IS THE ESSENCE of any individuality and WHAT YOU ALL SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DO IF you even would want to stand the SLIGHEST CHANCE of lasting ETERNITY AND THAT SIN, that could NOT see the light of day, is, MODESTY Here is my basic home. It got conquered by the civil deu to their bureacracy and vehement capitalism but I i will get it all BACK and build it BETTER and the wall paper they did n't soak that up and off they just put Egheghsea again over it. If you ask me about classical sculptor and seeing you as black surrealism i trust you have a liiiiiitle taste for more splendour then Egheghesii which i don't usually see here. IF there are no real Vampires I do not and I will not and can not develop gothic trains???? So yes, Gadflies happen to stab you, We are stuck in thereal world and the portals then as one world. Here is my Portal Ephemerhea, the Godess of portals, who crafted with The Goddess of marble in which all Roman and Hethreds lyrics and poems were written, in all humility, a thing i am tactically not permitted to HAVE MODESTY the epitomy of cardinal sin according to light angel of love satanic beliefs EXPLAINED, and very simple it is THE most imbecilic, stupid, and civil remark i ever heard, was probably the following "owh try to talk him out of getting so much money for the site" as i SAID, (ten years ago or about seven or six more specifically) YOU BET NOTHING, YOU EXPECT to LIVE FOREVER, and the EARTH DIES. WHAT A FUCKED UP EQUATION IS THAT YOU CIVIL VERMINT; now what did i do? I BET EVERYTHING, I EXPECTED TO DIE, and my SITE WOULD SAVE THE EARTH. and i would work my ass off just for paying the fricking programmer even if there is ZIT guarantee i will not be speaking to myself AS I AM HERE, and be on my site ALONE, and i don't GIVE A FUCK. and that, is not a spiritual nonsense. IT IS THE ESSENCE of any individuality and WHAT YOU ALL SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DO IF you even would want to stand the SLIGHEST CHANCE of lasting ETERNITY AND THAT SIN, that could NOT see the light of day, is, MODESTY VhempeyhreN the temple of sculptures i already had its at the end of the vampiric VhempeyhreN lane indulge me its just more classical to say VhempeyhreN anyway the temple of paintings i have no idea where it goes perhaps i should let countries give me an offer where to build it. Perhaps i need to build one in every city about. a sixtenth chapel styled saint Pieters at every city. Can it fit i gotta think about it. Now here is a story I am writing with my friend Aeylyeaelle, also know as Aeylyea, we and him have many personalities, now for those who call me a nerd to share so much text, i'm sorry for you. For trolls and other bitches i have no time. Etc. So if you like it, please be friends and share it a bit and indulge in a vampiric fantasy somewhat. It is legio that the angel of ecology and the angel of light would be in heaven, while in the underworld vanity and beauty Hethred does it just for that. And it ALL works. One with the other, above with below. Tears with fire. Tears to fall on fire. Indifferent fire, but not indifferent fire. As it grants it in a droplet of steam back towards the sky. The angel of ecology and the Angel of light are Hethreds friends, always the only quarrel who would be the most beautiful. For one Titanium stone that Hethred threw in melancholies palaces above. But as the angel of light and the angel of ecology both lay with Melancholy friendly near their owns and hers naked bodies. The stone which was their dispute, the palaces floors of heaven cascaded and water became they, and the stone fell from Heaven upon the earth. And upon Anaehtheana and that was the exact city where Anaehtheana Went. WHere she at the Ellendeh was. It is exciting times, all hope for a renaissence, adults want their cars to be cheaper, and burn supermarkets and oil installations for it to be so. And children everywhere strike from their studies, to wish for a nature and a world in the future, and take to study with a single candle. And Hethred saw that it was good, her whims in the creation of reality where as she considered as once this miscarriage a child of hers, irrationally as yet, a female concoction, was alas maturing. And melancholy with one single teardrop one raindrop to the earth, touched Aeylyeaelle and brought him some hope, one single droplet of her one eye, and Aeylyeaelle recognized it instantly that it was the Divine and supreme, most awesome and wholesome beauties personal and unique crafted purity in a droplet. And anaehtheana, from the girls wrecked angels dominion in the underworld, that could be called a lesbian phantomsphere, kissed the angel of Ecology Anuwheana on her lips, a kiss of friendship of 25 and 17, and they smirked as they glanced at eachother, and Anaehtheana now called the angels of heaven and Hell. and Hethred leant, one quarter of a squadron of her third elite emperessial guards, lets see if she can handle it with that. And Hellengelleh Goddess of tears as rain, as she wept, would have lent all angels of heaven, but in her wisdom knew, not calculated from Hethreds greed and benevolent splendour as she somehow knew more of her guards would strangle and effade the whole world, and sadness then cast out of heaven 7 million about as she saw of her angels, and it was enough. The abundance of seven. And for that. Arrival as a gift. Aeyeaelle had already composed, long nights before, one ship, the gift of God, Gods gift, a rose field, a rose field to carry roses from Aphrheah and to harbor at Anaehtheana this shit, with seven million roses. Exactly seven million, 777 and seven hundred and seventy seven roses. Edit or delete this Like · Reply · 58m Aeylyea Ellhe De Ellendeh And the kiss of 25 and seventeen is the marriage of Beauty and Ecology, of the human and female shaped delights of metaphysics, and of nature, solemnly laying without its master, that without a master would not be seen, like a female without a sculptor or artist. 25 and 17 is 42, 42 is 6, the number of the first, a Vampiric Tyrant. A crow lost in the land of Ellendeh. Plucked and withered and withered and miserable, And the crow spirit went forth to the temple of Etherith where he was, listen to the Ellendeh muse, and sat on his shoulder. And a sister to Ellendeh was born in the well. And now she had company and was sweet filled with hope, and now Aeylyeaelle had two muse, and their loneliness was broken. Now in order to or anyone to become an artist you must learn to see the litle or anything general as little and project it to the general. And that is when you take all seriously, and compose it with your mind in a harmonious whole. A vision is its phantomlike spirit as relevance. Merit is like having a golden bow, and an arrow of gold, and you are in the forest, and at some point, you may have a chance to shoot a deer, as you are an angel, and have the putrid taste for heavenly and melancholies beautiful blood. And so much is it sure that Anaehtheana will build her city, so much is it sure that a sole hunter, with a golden bow, and a golden arrow, must strike once write, in a forest so filled with deer. What my theory says, that where odds are so plentifull before you. Destinty is not far away. As an angel can not just settle for scraps of perception. We do live In Angel land. · Anaehtheana are a parable of faith and control and causality, Hethred controls, but lets anaehtheana roam free, and see if she does it. Causality controls, and see if i do it. It torments me, as much as it gives me the most beautiful signs. + - 1 second ago VhempeyhreN Its treu that in the Etherith Mythology which is how its called I also feature. I crafted with magick the crow, i am in him aeylyeaelle, without memory and melancholic, the perpetual panther who rages and cares at last for nothing. I am the Prince of artists who holds Salons, for the special breed of Daughters Of Hethred, to drink their blood, or i and my flock of vampires would change into bats cats or serpents. And when they lay, melancholy, said in a wicked, but as ever gentile Hethredean mood, you are a bit chubby angel of light. And she lashed a lightning bolt on a panther on earth. The only panther that ever got killed with a lightning bolt, and Hethred welcomed the beast as a gift, and sent it back to the earth, a zombie panther with a dead heart for vhempeyhren. The first artwork that was ever sent from the underneath under Hell to earth. As so many artworks were already made for the special breed of her daughters, that Hethreds crooked eye could not see and even a Vampire tricked Hethred, most cunning of Goddesses, that blind eye somehow. As the Vhempeyre and Hethred both had eachothers eye. Whereas Hethred were deep green, The Vempyeres crown eye were a disguise for living on earth, As much as Satans wings were not his on earth. And as much as Satans wings, the vhempeyres eyes were his only torment. Only Hethred could recognize them. 📷

"I was trying to be reasonable, uttered a few dreams, strolled around not without some elegance and trying to be dignified, which came naturally to me. And you wondered what it was, you broke my legs, I was sexually assaulted by old hags who think they are teens several times, humiliated me, locked me up in solitary, and even bickered when i said I almost conquered a city, throwing the tunnels shut with bricks and fighting the police with fireworks for my final stand. All this time i was trying to make high quality decorative art for YOUR supermarkets YOUR buildings of which decoration you have NOTHING? I was thinking a mythology to verify YOUR inspiration YOUR perception, and you throw me in the ditch. ONE city? No. Now its over, the gloves come of, and i will now preach the end of this society. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Mind you, if you place a little glass in front of 19th century reality, you could think well, that is somehow sustainable. But it was n't RESTING was n't it? Now if you hold a plate of glass in front of the fifties you could say well, if we reach space soon MAYBE it would be sustainable. Some time but you gotta work hard. Now if you then switch your plate of glass to this age. HOW ON EARTH WILL YOU MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE???? You have fifty years of the SAME energy that humans will generate in THE PAST FIFTY YEARS YOU HAVE FIFTY YEARS OF CITIES COMING, MASSIVE TONS OF GENERATED PRODUCTS. And you honoustly think you can do that by means of "sufficing the masses with all they need? You are WRONG, there needs to be MASSIVE confiscation and end of production of A LOT of these products. Confiscation for space cities of technology that came from spaceflight technology and for you information WAS ALWAYS WITHIN THE BALANCE STILL SPACE TECHNOLOGY, and for end of products WHICH WAS NEVER NEEDED, NOW YOU GOT IT, SO STOP IT, even a Greek would be moderatly surprised by SOMETHING or moderatly entertained by SOMETHING novel around the landscape. BUT IN YOUR RAGE HAVE YET TO WALK IN THE FOREST SO LONG TO UNDERSTAND IT. But a spartan dilligence you have not much of that, maybe its time to read a classical book and not let time get you thrown off so far. Your modern books are all so devoid of ethics and esthetics its no wonder you drivle and bicker and have always an opinion about not much meaningfull topic at all." "FIFTY YEARS, you seen how big it was the past fifty years, I challange you to produce another fifty years of that. THE ORGANICS IS EXPANDING, we are not polluting. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON MARS FOURTY YEARS AGO, WITH ALL YOUR BIOSPHERES AND TRAINS STATIONS OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL THEM, YOU STICK TO WORDS TOO MUCH, TRY TO PHILOSOPHIZE YEAH, MAYBE JUST TRY IT, CATCH UP NOW???? All that was done was waste valuable space city property and spaceships. If the democracy run Spain or Italy during the renaissence you would all have a gallion ship and fleet for your children to play with and the population fed with mcspains would have skyrocketed all the same, there is no difference between that age or this age. BUT THAT YOU ARE A STUPID MASS BABBLE PROJECT AND HAVE NO ONE TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU. IF THERE WAS A KING WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY AGREED ON THAT, BUT FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU KEEP PUSHING ME AROUND AND TELL ME GO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS IN CHARGE. "
WELL WHO IS IN CHARGE NOW?
I AM EFFECTIVELY LEADING THE PLANET WITH THESE MANIFESTS; NOW WHO WANTS TO BE THE FUCKING KING AND TELL IT TO THE TELETUBBIES YOU KNOW???
YOU ALREADY HAD DONALD TRUMP, YOU CAN HANDLE ME TOO. YOU THINK I WANT A DEAL WITH RUSSIA? BUILD CASINOS? I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH MONEY, LIKELY I WILL JUST NEVER HAVE IT OR EARN IT IN THIS WORLD OTHER THEN JUST TELL YOU WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO?!!! ALL THE OTHER POSITIONS ARE TAKEN AND CONSUMING THE PLANET FURTHER????
IM JUST TRYING TO COMPOSE AN ARTISAN GREEK OR ROMAN REALITY, YOU ARE STANDING IN MY WAY; YOU ARE CONSUMING MY SPACE, AND YOU DONT PROVIDE ME A FAIR CHANCE TO SURVIVE AS YOU UNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY SNOT OF THE PREDICEMANT HERE????
NOW YOU GOT SCIENTOLOGY POLARIZING PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHIATRY POLARIZING AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY, AND THE LEFT AGAINST THE RIGHT AND BUSINESSMAN AGAINST SOCIALISTS AND WOMAN AGAINST MEN. AND BY ALL MEANS YOU ARE JUST AN INCREDIBLE FREAKSHOW FOR ME TO WITNESS AND FOR MORE OF US UNDERNEATH YOU ARE A FREAKSHOW.
IM LOOKING BACK FROM TWOHUNDRED, TWOTHOUSAND OR FIFTYTHOUSAND YEARS, I CAN LIVE IT, I CAN GO WITHOUT YOUR MODERN SOCIETY AND ITS INCREDIBLE BUBBLE. TIME, DOES NOT, EXIST.
It was already said to be RELATIVE, at least you could have considered picking up an old book and then and live another reality. But most of you are doing that anyway, momentarily. But not long enough?!!!
If a casino or an entire heap of space stations stand there on earth. Does not imply i can not simply be my own GREEK or EGYPTIAN culture, walking in a forest or a desert. YOU LOST.
that is
NOTHING WAS LOST.
That means.
YOUR WORLD of the "new" ENDS.
Now considering i go back 200 or 2000 or 50000 years i could be a king of the sun, a jezus christ, or a first designer of the Sphinx of Egypt. Now you can all be that. But SOMEONE STILL HAS TO SORT OUT THE BEANS YOU REDICULOUS PAGGLEWAGGERS!! So what clothes MYSELF I will wear is entirely unsure. AS I DONT WANT TO IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH ANY CLOTHES CONSIDERING ALL YOUR FAKE AND CHINA IMPORTED NECK TIE AND OTHER SIMPLICITIES. I'm an artist, i'll develop some solid costume for myself some time. Have n't started yet. I GOT YOUR SHIT TO WORRY ABOUT. WHICH WAS NOT THE MAIN IDEA FOR ONE ARTIST TO HAVE TO BE CONSERNED WITH MOST OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY AGAIN. BUT HERE IT IS; YOU ARE LEFT AGAIN WITH ONE IDIOT WHO NEEDS TO REHASH THE WHOLE PAST 200 YEARS???? AAAAAND EEEEXPLAIN IT TO YOU AS BEST I CAN????
Now last but not least to mention, it is NOT
A THAT I THINK TO KNOW IT ALL,
it is
B A MATTER OF SURVIVAL AND ESTHETICS WHICH IS PART OF SURVIVAL
ergo
A YOU TRIED THOSE IDIOTS
B IF YOU WRITE ALL THIS YOU PROBABLY ARE RELATIVELY SMART
that is as SIMPLE
as it GETS for you
and about enough POLITICS as is ever needed for any of you bimbos.
Now start to form something that looks like a society and maybe i'll even grade you on how you are doing. So far, NOTHING. BECAUSE IM LEADING FOR TWENTY YEARS, ALL YOU GAVE ME WAS SHIT AND PISS, I GOT A LOT TO SHOW FOR, YOU AINT GOT SHIT AND PISS TO SHOW FOR SO FAR.

OF THE SOCIAL

Precious little soap bubble of poets sentimentality stabbed on a day to day basis by thousands of millions of people.

Ahhh democracy.

Take artists from their little cloud they say.

Ahh, I’ll take away all the arts, a plead of mine so serious.

But you won’t have a myth or a story or a faerytale left.

Just a selfie of your stupid snout, to live in infamy, and the tombstone directed towards an oblivion, i am here no more, this was my humble regard in your awe, a smirk, a lack of reposnability, i was just here among my seven billion fellows, indeed, a subject.

Wonder is meaning, meaning is wonder, the source of the fires of creations, to equate to nothingness and openness,
whereby the inspiration, the crystalizing of art the molding of the sun, extrapolating, placing all around human existence, is the answer to the question posed by nothingness, repose and wonder,
where beauty forms out of the learnt amazement.
In it human creativity mimics the universal.
But rather then a spirit to tackle the world, they gave us a consensus on how to share our most devoid and hollowed out spirit. Indeed what is left of the mainstream, of capitalism, but also of fascism and communism, of the left and the right.

To summerize the manifest… i'm not a fan of evolution and it should preferably be scrapped to the bin.
Like an Einstein revolution on Newton we might think the basic science is just a very primitive perception.
I mean not all cone shaped eggs that exist near cliffs had the less cone shaped ones fall off the cliff, even if a material influence over time could here be presumed, we presume but the material fastening of reality. We presume there is no wealth. Which as a counsciouss then becomes an opinion, not scientific fact as it is presumed. Our thinking mind would itself become huddled into a narrow area, unable to breathe freely where we have ended up.
Not all paradise birds died out for not coping with orchids growing deeper or whatever.
Not all genitals grew because of the shaft to the womb.
These things can be considered too distant to be just an afterword of material influences of competition.
For that matter how does the quantum world relate to the molecular world and to the visual world if those can not see eachother? Like genitals. No artist works on one artwork and selects others and comes up with a significant and unison body of work. It simply grows and falls into place?!
It all also creates as such, falling into place.
To an artist evolution theory should be superficial hogwash.
Not all nuns and priests in monestaries can be considered non vital redendant genes. (even if i know you might giggle especially here)
But seriously it would seem like for a deer and a lion to have a balance needs intuition more.
Besides i have n't actually read Darwin, but its said he talks of harmony more then the survival of the fittest, what the dialectic capitalists and communists took out of it.
(besides not reading at all THAT many works that i criticize leading to modernism. Its too depressing to read anyway any of it once you got the basic system of it all. And they might have amused themselves, to see where it has lead us now is diar and unfathomable. A consensus on subjectivity. Wauw.)
It all leads to me having a system where everything is intuition and decorative, creation leads to the act of creating as the main theme, an answer to and superior cause for a newer wonder. (In this the “troll” and all those hysterical over faecal matter and us being mere bacteria are apart of that sect. They used to be deeply religious. Its just now the scope of life is equated to mold and eventually to manure. More about this in the next introductory section.)
What we imply is that harmony for a part of evolutionary ways means there needs to be a much more powerfull creative force then the mere selection. You can fight and kill off a species and say i am the fittest, how then would evolution be explained if you could pat someone on the head? Likely no horns will grow out of that. In essence this system of competition does n’t explain creation at all, and leaves but functionality, uninhibited growth, lack of composition, lack of decoration, and a staggering loss of allegoric and serene value. It also needs to grow a horn, in variation, it needs to want variation, and in a distance have eyes to evolve with other things blindly. Which means the creation itself is not that blind. Ivory in a row, there is n’t all kinds of species extinct with failed jaws, in these forms, it also needs to get a hair line, a coat of feathers, a measure of attractiveness. But as it is unique features could never develop, all that could develop from a blind creation was a ball of cancer. Creation and art, serenity to have a better word for the religious and faithfull nature and the imagination to have a better word for the deities we use in art and the combination of both which would form religion. These notions are put in the bin by a limited scientific scope an archeology as much as we dig up cultures but from the perspective of subjectivity we can not find a newer culture, we have effectively become parasites, this thinking backwards in stead of cultures of the past who thought forwards. The past pointed into directions, the present in the current abyss of the “believe in yourself” and other existentialisms only lead people to fixate and have no relation to the past, nor are they able to fathom their future as the earth is clogging up with all this garbage. There is effectively an abberant reality created out of this subjectivity.
That science creates this cult of functionality right now, that is in itself also decorative, but also pretty paradoxical.
Its what leads me out of this society and see it for what it is, a big sect.
I was once apart of it reading into Schopenhauer, Sade, but Sade basically left me with the paradox.
If you can do everything? Why would any moral limitation speak pro subjectivity or pro selfishness or pro individuality? That there is an object to a subject destroyed any convention and toppled the convention on an outer esthetics, which was ultimatly the cause for a nature worship, followed by the decadents and later communist or fascist, then general family life and consumer idolatry. Everything came to an end, untill the decadent and redundant and ample offspring of the families dressing up cosplaying in the hive or sitting in dungeons playing games.
Why would n't that (subjectivity) be then a convention? Like Foucault already was onto that.   
This then leads to the hive being grown and if you think in terms of having a subjective opinion the hive will grow further.
Thats why i have such megalomaniac plans. To prove this society is an illusion.
Its also why I narrow spirituality down to a material act of creation and inspiration in between both the kitshy faerytale fantasy and spirituality on the one hand, and then on the other hand the conceptual, the minimal and the non artisan.
The artisan can create any spirituality in between those colors.
I mean thats the basis of my system.
In essence if the allegory is a represenation why did all art slowly die with Kant? We live in a very subjectified reality. A reality which always needs to be limited without a general criticism. This criticism does n’t even exist other then out of hopeless and surpassed left and right wing presumptions out of subjectivity. But furthermore we consider its a false assessment. The succession of theories on the subject created a convention with BUT the subject and no one to escape it anymore in this day and age. Besides that no philosopher remarked the simple notion, that should have been discovered a while earlier, that the structure is expanding. This is not just over population as now proposed. It was expanding for hundreds of years. That the world filled with cars over the past 100 years is somehow to humans an idle awareness, its as if it was always like this and it will be always like this. People today have no cleu they think and cling desperatly to a stationary reality. “we just have to figure things out, settle, provide everyone with the goods they need” But this is not what is going on here at all. We are stacking one building on top of another and could possibly in some more composure from philosophers and some more attention of them already colonized Mars by now. As i fear we should have. And the time might already be too late for that. We missed our window likely. And the chocolates and plastic gadgets and games other commercials are still being broadcasted, which is not very much a solid plan if you know this humanity is already widely prone to religious feelings.
When I mention, well, we can take a last stand now. There are just cultures i consider possibly to move along with that. But likely. No one in society far removed from the sect exists to act.
It is why I myself, having attacked a sculpture in a public park with a viking axe. Am considered insane.
IN fact, i am free, most people are not, completely tied in with consumption.
I have had once arranged a whole interior with found wood and second hand objects just laying in the streets.
And recently i have not consumed for ten years but for some very cheap lasagna’s, leaving the house only rarely.
How other people stack their homes and drive in circles is unfathomable to me.
Preferably I would not be among these creepy people.
I claim simply that the truth as its currently conceived and was conceived and grew will drive you insane, now of course there is nothing against that and you could say well then we all should grow insane. I’m just myself converted to a truth that may be more livable. TO change, interchange the nominators. That in itself may be some proof for beauty and decorative art. which is worthwhile and very much not considered. But besides that I always saw myself as part of the avant garde. There just are n’t many advances in the oblivious masses of modern concoctions. It will leave one to drown. So we can say as soon as the avant garde reached full consensus. It was clear that the religious are religious again and for that purpose i needed to distance myself and find my kin on an entirely new trajectory?! And how to do that? If all are individuals now. Who is to say who says a lot and who says very little?















This Manifest is for the anorexics, the suicidal, the philosophers, underground artists and wise ABOVE ALL. To the ones with background, to which this age is a pit of despair they are trapped into. To ones who already knew this wasteland of existentialism had no fertile land to offer. To the ones who want to embrace beauty or the classical spirit for a start they are trembling naked against the closed padded cell of this modern reality, where for most part beauty is said to be subjective; but no marker is made where it is to each subject anywhere ?! Or for that matter where the ugliness of modern society begins then... if it is so amazingly subjective. To the ones who’s soul is both inept as unable to pentrate the current mediocrity with their controversial and ornate spirits. Boisterous souls underneath who we should value above all, have the foam at their lips of seeing this all stupidity, and no means to intervene. Their emotions cannisters of havoc and turmoil, and for sure a chewing gum commercial and that whole attitude of those things mainstream would n’t amount to any redemption to their hard on bitter disasters toiling hearts. Music is one thing, revolt in this ecologic crisis another, however a third move, without the emancipation of artists and philosophers, to give them a safe haven and feature them atop with all the information needed, there is no future… This manifest also means to liberate all metal and classical movements, games and costume games, play and role play into proper culture, mobilize any left or right wing into a sense of decor, mostly we are a material movement stating that the material is where the proof is and right or left wing are but idle opinions who mostly amount to no result or solution. The left does n’t accept decoration which is the only path towards employment of the ingenious, the beautiful, the brave, the sharp and the smart. The right wing does n’t accept pluralism and decadence. May it be known we accept in their extremities both left and right cultures as esthetic qualities, at no point do we think nor that their provocation is NOT entirely solid and on point, (considering what the establishment looks like and what their voices want to sell us for any value whatsoever) nor that their opinion can not be entirely worked out and crafted all in itself, a soldier may be a soldier, for his nation he may be a proud soldier. There is nothing of malice in that if he is as we consider him to be, decorative. Others may want everyone to play games and eat pizza and furbish everyone in lazyness, not solidifying any actual culture. Dialectics will and should prevail as destiny., destiny is where nothing is left but intuition and inspiration, and no relation to reason is left, because all reason is left here... There is no pragmatic aproach, we are left with a “reality” which is nauseating. There are many values and anthems locked in games and cosplay. Then you go but I am here to rise up, or i am closest to your ideals, then they go its JUST a game, owh but no Its JUST a game why don’t you make music or a game against the current deathcult commerce? You are against it or for it. Then if black metal says some real things here and there they go “no they don’t believe it they just gave in to commerce no one believes their song lyrics.” well none of that really matters this denial and giving in to the status quo and “reality” and this existential “none is treu but myself and i can’t do any good” is itself helping the decay and the decay is helping the end of the so called “economic reality”. To this and many other extent we applaud the deficit, as it makes us brood so fierce on an all surmounting summary and conclusion. But one thing is certain, there is something wrong with the subject, and the empty subjects dancing everywhere atop the rubbish and the diar filth this the false pretension of society. The hive is being built, any prophet is deemed to have his own subjective opinion within the hive, he munches pizza, and he is a limited component in an ideal structure. We here have a manifest that will topple the notion that everything can be reduced and reductionalized. This in itself creates the hive. This is an impoverishment. When this machine assembles all the older voices, with background and already established with elder views, then the mainstream will be somewhere, full of rubbish hysteria and despair, left to themselves, we don’t need them. And they are indulging but in their own vomit. There is nothing precious about their culture, and where they have rejected any of our writings our philosophies and our music because it was too critical and subversive. Well. Good riddence to them! Also multiculturalism in advance can be understood. It was a delusion of modernism to think subject culture was any culture at all. In fact those skyscrapers and ironic hamburger restaurants and other produce and culture now worldwide is not a culture, it was created by nihilism, defaitism, subjectivity, solipsism, existentialism, considering a building should not be seen, considering everything was going to be a wasteland, considering we are “waiting for Goddott” considering we should not speak of what we can not know etc. These people created a religion. The very kitshy and bleak decoration of this culture is the softness, the lauzyness of our emotions. Yes in the astral projection, the gaze to the stars, a nuclear bomb at star even even, in the recognizable merit of treu art and of brilliant artists do we find society breathing. And what do we have left now? Time for the all cultures in decoration as there are art nouveau elves and gothic vampires, roman and byzantine angels, etc. If the ecology can still be salvaged that is. Time for them all to be created, molded, gathered, puzzled together and fitted in the proper decor, the time for fiction to suck all the beauty out of life is over with this entirely new emancipatory machine. In Elvish can be said Enontië, rebirth, ressurection, which is this age. The ressurection of arts and ecology. indeed the measure to which Lord Of the Rings becomes serious and where Rivendell and temples to nature can be built, for those that indeed studied the very SENTIMENTAL language, in no way fantasy and in no way will it remain fantasy... with the funds necessary, and with the funds organized and provided by the Empresses here we may restore ecology and esthetics alike, no nature without esthetics, no esthetics without nature. We will see to a federal reserve, a capital hill and a white house for Europe, and for every culture. As there is nothing else to build but perhaps they were thinking of building more train stations on top of train stations. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE?! With Roman salutions we may say Aehvhea to the Roman angel legions. To the Gothics we say well. One step in our graves and yet one step back then now!! Likewise where the left would rise up, anarchy for the corrupt regimes, we say good riddence to the mainstream, artists and visionaries are drugged so yes. But for there to be kings and nobility rising against the current establishment, for new movements and knighthoods to arise, light or dark in presence alike, this can not be averted and for the left merely to fight those provocative revolts and in their curtailing the revolt thus to benefit the status quo, well that is a sad case of aborting a beautiful renaissence. The subject defended a mediocrity, it placed the hive central, consumption and commerce central, whatever exists needs to consume, and whatever consumes can be sold anything; If its cheap and ergonomic. The hysterical suffice in every need possible as we do not know composition. The avant garde runs dead and all the beauty is in the underground, discarded as a hobby of sorts. We do not agree with the established notion of sales of any garbage. As a matter of fact it would be a good notion if many consumer goods are on a blacklist. -Surely after Duchamp satire of harnassing electricity back from pushing door bells created modern rhapsody in consumption and would n’t it be apt for mocking commerce with a blacklist now back in its turn?- We blacklist commerce not because we are against pluralism or the democratic discourse, but because some in these strange avant garde times would still relish in a beautiful sculpture and some candle light, and would need to find others simply with this machine. We would not need to when others already gleefully claim art is not usefull. On the contrary. If it is not art it is not very usefull at all. A church is usefull because it is art. And keen to contemplation and ethics, esthetics, allegory. A cell phone mast merely is part of cackle and desensory living. So it is not usefull. That for a standard, we would n’t want to make that statement into extremity. Let us not forget people are enslaved to make redundant products, not in the least the ecology is at a fatal collapse soon. One needs to hate society a lot to delve up all the facts on the diar state of ecology. And should we then tinker with this whole hive growth? To the ones who are not caught up in dialectics but observe the tranquility of the rotten books this hysteria is a sect. And if it is a sect there is nothing pluralistic about it at all. To dissect that whole system and to regress to classical esthetics and formality while salvaging our minds again is the creed of this work. A reverse subjectivity if you will.
As it is said in IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS “we can not hold all these powers any longer.” We write, we wrote, we will write, entire worlds, with subjectivity was written but a carcass of a culture, time now to destroy the subject philosophy!! And find ourselves, back at the french revolution entirely, with a few lessons learned, and the artists kings and decorative queens now surely to prefer, from purple (artistic) bleu (royal) or red commoners blood, but surely if you trace your genes, you will find you are all already bleu blood, and if you provide the world with ideals, with creativity, with revolt, with art, with something to mock the empty establishment, then you are a purple blooded artist. For the empty phrases, the hollow leadership, the corrupt bombs, the anguished last stands of modern militaries, for the chess game to end, and a new game to begin, that is a matter of the hollow being set to work soon. For mankind to be a profit to the earth, not some bacterial growth while the intelligent ten percent should commit suicide and be a slave and a prey, a punching ball for stupid troll hysteria and despair. Where Nietzsche had said overcome yourself, i have now but to overcome myself, and do what he said, or rather, deny what he said, overcome yourself is not something still worthwhile to say at all. Where Holderlin said the idealists would always create newer horrors, this is no longer treu, me to be a subject or a distopian would see the death of the earth now. I do not want to say with Goethe that Leaders with armies kill more then poets who describe misery, i don’t want to say that to youth and mature people who never had a chance to a solid environment for a lasting and truly intimate love, with all the filth washing over, with all the adverts cynically barking at one every five seconds. Misery is more genuine then all that drivle and hollow bourgois stupidity left of the bourgois of old with their high art. now they are standing naked. And our melancholy, i will find a meaning so vast, that it blows the last despaired screams of the adverts and of society and its terminal doom away. I can say, as i say that the oceans died for my mythology, rather then that the oceans inspired me to write a mythology, i can say, not with Jung that there are archetypes with a semblance of truth, i can say arch symbols can be perpetually crafted in newer and more worthwhile and more meaningfull and logical directions. We have the hand of creators, therefore we are apart of and disciples of all the creators and masters. I can not say with Colin Wilson that satan needs to be proven to exist or science can not take the next step. You can not prove what you in advance postulate that you don’t know it for sure, and for sure many have had faith in this age more from bravoure or some kind of disdain for society, but faith on all sides prevailed, as faith is what you have left when science and hollow words ruin all, and intuition and life was all you had left to go on. When all that could be rationally conceived was already indeed done and over with, it was time for a new grand scream, and so in this manifest and machine it is concluded then. I say surely the streets do look empty and anonymous, and there is fiction and the derogatory language towards esthetic and ecologic reality to blame for that. Games and fiction is all where all can still be, and i’m to rip it open, out of it, and spill it all back on the earth. Let you not be called a nerd for the sake of idiots, let you not be called an intellectual for the sake of idiots, let you not be called a snob for the sake of idiots, let you not be called a sparkling author for the sake of idiots, when you sparkle as you write, then you should slay the ordinary comments, slay a whole world with it, and for that we must seperate the wheat from the chaff. Your, my will is prophecy. And you must break with the age. And when there is an age so monotomous as this one. With a rage so profound for hundreds of millions. Then here they find the sewer, where they can all have their own world, and the world of the masses, will be for very few, once they have found their weakness, and ran along after the stronger spirits. The stronger spirits will be known as equals and brothers and sisters, who rage on through any incredulous stupidity taken for a truth, or the arrogance of stupidity, to yell empty offences, Does one in the front line ever yell an empty offence? Or does he manage to lie and feign his ways? He can not, he is unadapted, depraved, deranged, delusional. In this world. Yes. But never with this pit of crawlers, this soothing with rubbish. This nicety and novelty for ruin and empty, wasted, hollow powers. Black metal, gothics, dungeon synth, cosplayers, they were the only ones there, halloween, fiction, games, they were the only ones home. Then some kind of mainstream would call all this nerdish, if there are any left outside?! But there was nothing but an empty, zombie walk, a deathride. The current of theirs runs dead, as our current, never too embarassing a despair in this world, has only to begin.
If there is n’t JUSTICE; then you could tell that to the Marquis de Sade who could have decapitated the ones who sentenced him on false pretences to years in captivity. But he spared them from the guillotine. That there is no JUSTICE is therefore flagrantly untreu. Furthermore Pantheons will be built for all musical directions BLACK METAL and DUNGEON SYNTH and a pantheon will be built with the last 200 years of WISE IN CLOAKS, Van Gogh will be there with ONE MINUS POINT? He should have asked in his testament for the profits of his work to be beneficial in use to artisan workshops for artists so there would still be BEAUTY. NIETZSCHE HAS THREE MINUS POINTS, for the fact that dialectic rulers should n’t exist, rulers should be stationary. Not have will power at all, everything should be stationary, nothing should be dialectical at all really, no one should take the notion of a perpetual repetitive will seriously as it is clearl that for one thing cultures vary within their arts (only), and also that the structure is simply expanding so dialectics does n’t exist. Mercy is a beautiful power. And he caught himself in the subject trap trying madly as no other to get out of it. SCHOPENHAUER gets three minus point, reality does exist in itself, it does n’t have to WORK to exist. AND for kicking the neighbour down the stairs, AND one giant minus point, as it sinks his entire system but anyway. A PHILOSOPHER DOES NOT OPEN DOORS. Nice though as in the future philosophers when spotted will actually be seen people to open their doors. I certainly did n’t have that prilige granted to me by anyone else.
SADE gets ONE PLUS POINT, excusing his captors.
This is how all of them will be sculpted with cloaks and a stitched point in a line over their SHOULDER.
Sade created a pharce in which still was sense, each man shall be the prophet of his most mediocre or derogative word alike. And was n’t Orwell a Prophet then? It became very treu to me where they literally said “you are stupid because you are intelligent” would n’t that be scary? Would n’t that be the end of the line? Would n’t you not not be able to get out of a system or distopia then? Was n’t it needed to be his WILL to state something else? Why did n’t he write about faerytales, maybe he did but they probably never made it to print or attention. Commercial hysteria is the success and the ugliness, the really depraved in which mankind recognizes itself as the poet alone recognizes his own beauty then, himself, coiling in his own gravity, untill the sheens of this gravity need to break and all reality lay crippled.
A genius is fire because he (has to) fight(s) fire with fire, and then the anguish turns against him, each and every time, he knows of generous moments, but also meets a lot of despair on his way, of the old ways dying in the masses, in the crowds, in the past, in the elder, in the culture in its descent. To some a marvel, to many more a heinous offense, and in being offensive, fire to set the world ablaze, and as the world is a sphere of reflections all caught in the same diamond, we now cut the diamond, or rather we cut it in thousands of different pieces, and robe it upon a crown. Again, we tie ourselves to esthetics and ecology. A thread that is proposed underneath. And of which like minds i would well like to meet and speak. Of which organization is the goal of this site. The zombie walk of common people and their common lives, with their entire culture may be classified and can try to repeat itself to the most detrimental end, we will not stop fighting for an alternate reality, or find those to build an alternate reality with. An arcadia then. But why would this arcadia be without Authority??
Furthermore we should say, if this earth is dying, which it certainly appears to be, we have yet to make way for a general acceptance of serenity and contemplation, and the capability for that to root in people. This advertisement and other entertainment frenzy and the declaration of so much of it of how splendid and glamorous ordinary civil life is and how retarded we can all still be, is not apropriate. Here we should at least have a refuge to forget about the lack of idealism. If not vanquish the world completely, as we would in advance be more strong and more well versed and well read, or otherwise or of other ails suffering beings.

We see ecologic and esthetic destruction obscured by an ego grown blind by 200 years of abstract philosophy.
We are here to solve that.
Certain popular books with indulgence regardless of any ideal, with leasure and consumption, living the big life, dating and relationship etc, are apparently printed with a scope to interplanetery recognition. While idealists have to go to their family or dating sites Gods forbid, to explain about even the pristine forests to be in cardiac arrest and all the animal sounds muting. This planet is officially in Intensive Care now.
For that reason we built this media to unite all media under proper principles, the pyramid has now turned upside down.
The subjective indulgence does NOT have to be prime importance and the ideals to solve the diar state of ecology should NOT be subjective, therefore all other media are entertainment inclined and are the “let it be” piling on top of the deficit.

"The world has seven billion subjects who are all preoccupied with themselves, this is the theory, it is certainly the majority who has the superficial views and is aided by democratic and commercial institutions to the most debased and earth gutting ideal, while the wise and existentially critical beings are underneath. An answer for subjectivity allegedly does n't exist. However an answer answers aplenty for subjectivity and the diar state of the ecology are plentyfull here, and should, and can not be denied not by the existentially critical who suffer from the problem and the state of the ecology that is n't resolved without looking at the problem. And the machine for wise and frail to gather now, with legions and international armies all to know where it ends and where it begins, and with the prospects of finding everyone and making a last stand, at least with this site those prospects for the future are looking good."


"People will always be able to excuse themselves saying "nature will take revenge" or they will make it easy on themselves and say "they are already doing that" better yet. “in a few years.” WHAT in a few years? Leave it to our children. Leave WHAT? But at some point that all will bite everyone in the ass, and these seven billion bubbles are not collectively doing their contribution for the better, but are doing their contribution for the worst. And no modest tinkering of seven billion individuals under this state of commerce will help. Time to reassert the values of subjectivity and the proper context of composition. Now that the forests and the oceans are dead, after twenty years of refutals of intelligent people. Now we will have to do a lot of work to keep the planet artificially alive. THis will not be with human beings "living modestly". There will be a lot of people that need to get a shovel into the dirt. There will need to be a grand mobilization. The garbage people have, you can't keep selling that. So the economy looking for newer consumption goods is effectively coming before a grand stand still. There is a limit how many defunct products you can sell, to sell them again, and there is a limit of keeping workers enslaved and going in circles for nothing but destructive cultures.

Well this naivitée and beauty of some angelics or elvish depictions a post and concept could just make you shed tears. So. THank those for offering another reality then the adds materialist we were just sickened and disgusted by. Its a polarization, if materialism is shit and below, then this concept is superb majesty over society and must be when we gaze to the stars, a diety projecting into a supreme beauty answering to us as sure as matter is here. Something in this universe, far beyond, gazes at us and wonders about us, not aliens but some faerie concept, a ghost dictator, a malevolent angel, who knows, If they are aliens they are deformed, none human, so why would n't faith just tie us to a deity that had us in mind for creating? We were created we must have some purpose, without that, we change matter, so with a wonderous beauty in mind we can change matter as well. something to tie us to some meaning. This whereas yeah, the shit society throwing shit at you from debilitating adverts not quite caring how meaningless you find it and provoke you to commit suicide or to convert to black metal hates. YES, beauty and principles of beauty exist. It is not subjective, being that, there is no meaningless not triumphed over by imaginative spirituality. Wherein all this below this earth, under the ether of stupidity should n't triumph one day over meaningless materialism? If it is proven that some knights templars disobeyed the command of their leader and alone swiftly stampeded into battle looking for glory, then THAT what THEY proven is spirituality. And this earth should shatter. WHat Joan of arc did. THAT is glory. And this earth should shatter. People say this paddle court will not destroy the world, while they also say we must contribute our small part. THose two don't add up. The world will be instilled some reservation and some beauty NOW. They will publish relevant theory and sincerity NOW. they will shut their yap and stop their primate wuha wuha NOW. gaze to the stars in the eye of spirituality. Lets forget this global machine spewing shit. The society of looking down, speaking to the most debased nature of mankind, that era is over. We want matter to be glorious and propaganda to be genuine and pure. We know what that is, we can have all romantic paintings on billboards, have people take from supermarkets what they want tell them to be MORE modest then before, and without adds maybe they won't be maniacal. Its just an idea of course. But matter has never been more chopped up into meat loaf, if you can do that you also know what was brooding below in anguish. Seperate church and state, great idea, what harm is there in saying GOD IS THE LORD. Very harmfull indeed. And in the despair that they flee from that, they have found meaning in the dirt spewing machine. Maybe GOD IS THE LORD is part of the all imaginative forces of which beauty was once, and now no more... Now then there is a beauty in defiance, if there is no beauty, let me just enjoy to defy, whichever way works. I don't need words to asses what i see, a world of cheap spit at you, and cheap and worthless beauty underneath, and this FAITH in the superficiality of capital above. I exist, so i AM faith. And with that said. HOLLOWNESS destroys itself as much as it is savory to be independant of it and to contribute to its destruction? My only savory life; the death of modernist society. Its coming. How much force and spirit in anticipating it. How much do they bleed now, momentarily amused, when they just stand there, and nothing would ever change. A rotten status quo, rotter then second hand books; Who will remain? The second hand books, or the status quo?


they are literally delving the grave of society with trillions of kilotons of dislocated resources and spaceflight material in games and blenders for crying out loud
there are PROBABLY thousands of people committing suicide every day
all because they don't hear of my manifest.
because this subjectivity and adds etc
philosophers
artists, quitting, working for the do it yourself store.
AMOK RUNNERS, they are out daily shooting people
you think Breivik would have killed sixty politicians if my machine was already working?
I ATTACKED with an axe fifteen years ago before youth for climate, before Breivik, Before Kim De Gelder killed five babies
i burnt my own desk and almost put my house on fire
because my texts are being denied for "sixty year old grannies dating on tinder?!!!"
are you fucking with me?
"you are not delivering a kidney."
are you serious?
You steel the show in underestimating this thinG.

Again.
You have ANY idea what is out there?


then some people are found that are actually reading the manifest
some artists SOME, some intelligent ones who know their shit!
REPROGRAM THE WHOLE EARTH
and we have our own military.
"your not delivering a kidney?????"



not delivering a kidney?
i'm STUCK in an empty cage for twenty years
sometimes literally in psychiatry
i would like to talk to a human beinG.

i have literally an empire anticipated
with thousands, if not millions of people, and millions if not trillions worth of projects.
DREAMS?
the more you scoff and derogatory comments on dreams the more "reality" stays alive
my manifest and myth says "the reality we are supposed to stick to is ending"
This society probably has TWO years TWOOO
you can see it falling apart.
You watch Guy Mcpherson? says humans will loose all habitat in two years, he thinks it can happen any day. he delivers PROOF of that every day!!! You think owh everything is subjective thats probably just a conspiracy Jeremy Jackson? he proves the ocean is almost dead, Chris Hedges? The end of american Empire Max Keiser? Maybe you should follow Max Keiser and read up on his crypto book.

As far as i know i am an intelligence
as far as i know ancient courts would relish in the wise cracks of intelligence
as far as i know all these leaders stand there naked debating nothing but shit
because of subjectivity
and as far as i know if i don't gather intelligence these people will "subjectify" everything
You seen the size of bank buildings lately?
THAT is how high my paranoia and misery goes
its all a big fraud and i hacked it to bits and pieces in my manifest
its empty.
you seen money lately? Its empty
And we need to have a solid answer
i already gave you all those ideas.
"you not giving away a kidney."
do you see anyone ELSE with all the kidneys of this earth?

it could all topple any second
and then no one can be found
then its all apocalyps from here to kingdom come
just all starving, chaos, and starving.
No hope
thats misery man
you think anyone is aware?
I'm screaming for a reason, not for a kidney. no




Subjectivity destroys all meaning, if you had found meaning you would want to destroy all subjectivity.
This is what I can rightfully say when I contest the modern reality. And state that there is no diversity or culture, then those will say, “but everything is subjective so your opinion does n’t count.”
It is a paradox of subjectivity that most can’t be the master of themselves, hence become white pages who scoff those with identity. It is also a paradox one would then in that world be an individual, as he will be ruled by, and eventually has to suffer the demise of; a majority of slaves.
I will say, reluctantly “I am responsable for everything that happens on this planet” and then they will reply “yes and feel responsable for all this mess and misery? I’m off to an island” Is n’t to start a better world you must begin with yourself a hypocrisy too then? How vain. How idle. Its exactly what is wrong with this world, modest tidy solutions that acreu for the majority. And nothing changes, because the majority has already won here. And its marching to the cliff. Would then not to launch a full and complete assault? Not be idle and vain. And suicidal? Would you then not join me in responsabilty? Do you even dare? Then stand back, if you do not want to carry a heavy load, stand back, and seek refuge, for you will work an idle job. While i will rule the idle. You have the convenience of a peace of mind. I have the inconvenience of the weight of future dreams. Don’t try to weigh my merit with your morals.
We feel that the all study of social intelligibility seeing good and kindness in most people is a sect preaching to their own choir, polarizing against the rich, the rich perceiving the masses as stupid and too rigid, naive, manipulatable and conservative for change if at all they had desired such an outcome, taking advantage of them is more succesfull to say the least, of which is a proven fact, for people to postpone a limited sectarian or partially flawed or naive new age awareness otherwise or they might cherish the system of spoiling the working classes who don't even need to be spoiled,... etc
We are none of those. We are the artists, since ages misanthropic, however this was part of the crime and downward spiral of leaving subjectivity to each, which then paved the way for people to be coerced into defaitism and nihilism, and tied to the stupidity, misanthropy is the recognition of mankind as a failed system. If at all we artists are part of this, having constructed for us an ivory tower, if philosophers have been part of this, setting up a crisis for everyone, leaving them to fill in the blanks, of which are many and mostly were a darkness provided which sucked up all the good. 
Then effectively now, we seek to be artists coming down from these ivory towers for a last stand, of which will be ruthless and uncompromisable, and only comparative to the diar distresses imposed by lavish and mindless consumption over the ecology. WHich is to say if we at all do not create more drama then nature, if we effectively do not shut down society before nature collapses, then we are at a loss to the ideals, if we do not bend 70 percent of an economy of pure fiction into worthwhile goods, then we fail, how such a system existed and allowed all into polarizations or is effectively a sect is the great gist of this manifest, to set us an awareness of what this seventy percent of fiction really is, is necessary for the modern logic to fall through the opening usually found above a sewer, and to pour perhaps some other waste water on top, preferably peeing on this civilization perhaps to flush, but surely not at all piss it away with pure water or wine or precious amounts of expencive whiskey.
That the working class now in their new found conservativism sees all as their enemy, and that for them and on their behalf, surrealists, romanticists and all these were rehashed from avant garde movements who wanted to overthrow if not even setup new surrealist systems?! Now then towards degrading them into cheap humour and cheap entertainment and cheap advertisment.
The crisis of great systems left the masses to individual brawls and competition, paving way fot the giant meat grinder of the ecology, as there can be no other consensus then strife.
This strife then in a decorative fashion which the avant garde effectively hollowed out or provided the masses with the cynicism and regardlessness for it so it is all mere nakedness.
We all know.
But there is simply a lack of innovative ideas, and it creates everyone being passive.
if of course you state a simpe social innovation, people will answer and make up arguments for the world as it is.
devoid from left popular stance or consumer stupidity, or even left wing arrogance and lack of pluralism and hysterically civil considerations then.
We remain as we are deemed underground, even infinatly more scattered, villified, as resentfull of all these disgusting subordinates.
we have effectively needed to overcome and find our words somehow, to overcome the constant bullshitting in their tone of voice, crawling and bending and refuting any relevant argument.
Many have not made it
again
we are gathering for the last stand
After which the earth, -inevitably-, if we fail, -and probably-, even if we win, will collapse.
At no point does one want to be another artist in his ivory tower not conspiring??? THE MASSES TOOK THAT!
it was done
they are not dinstinct anymore, all the masses are doing what the artists told them to do.
THAT
was the logic
so we can not distinct ourselves with that
we will fight, with the mere cause, of making it more troublesome to the trivial to die with the earth, to stack on top of that.
If we are a weight, we want to be a weight around the neck of the people.
We do not want to hear we are just touting or ordering or being unindividualistic etc
that is how they pull is down.
We love individualism
it just was n't meant to be.
We clearly see that now.
so the lies to defend this world for its individualism
are clearly to be fought against
people have no time
to look for information
individualism to these people is voluntary slavery, to gobble up as much resources with as little regard as possible for a decorative, artistic, spiritual, and sound, even moderaly functional system.


a wealth of ideas and new ideas should be promoted
however they will always defend the status quo and all things with the notion "capitalism is logical" "everyone has their own opinion"
How can this be at all usefull if there is a wealth of ideas to come from themselves, but they throw any of these out of the window with “there is an opinion”.
And how does capitalism get defended if it is so ecologically devestating poor and agreageous to deplete resources of language and culture and craftsmanship?

Countertactics
we must remain to confront people of the triviality and the paradoxical and non existent of their brains
and eventually enslave them
and abuse them as they would (and have) abused us
for better course of humanity and for the last stand
which finally
involves ourselves as benevolent tyrants
of which minds with actual ideas were opressed only to detriment of themselves and anything else

we perceive it so and consider here
that a breakdown of enlightenment thinking did not occur as progressives said
ironically, it was enlightenment thinking that gave us exactly the society we could have expected if we see the human being as inherently religious
it rehashes anything even if its a complete paradox
to think for yourself becomes a detriment for the sole person that escapes that as a philosophy, and then he is combatted by everyone saying everyone thinks for themselves, they are that compliant and complacant

of course this society is what it is
under individualism the artists disgusted the people, the people scoffed the artists, the rich supressed the workers, the workers hated the rich, etc
no unity is begotten but for some last solace in some money and some product that could possibly come from it
the rich are not keen on managing or spending. This subjectivity created the worst and most limited of games.
buy whatever you can do not save or pay for quality in any way for the poor


“If seven billion people cry out distopia and criticism on the economy meanwhile flowing into it as a whole then it is no surprise that there are no solutions or it is getting worse. Therefore personality can not be subjectivity. They are opposites. It becomes now urgent and very necessary to emancipate and develop Utopian ideas when criticism has become the bulk of the idealism. It becomes avant garde not to be ironic about everything and take something serious again. As it is exactly the circus they created that leads us to the abyss. Idealism and nature is formality, to have lost formality is a disaster, to regain it in this idealism of subject delusion is the case made by this manifest.”

Again I talked about subjectivity, and the chapel of nothing on the psychiatry domain, that its not that easy to get out of. They just replied "that i have problem with the time" as if thats simply a subjective opinion again in its turn, being the sole reason this culture is so stuck. If everything is just apart of a subjective experience, and then namely to survive, consume, travel, procreate, how will we ever save the earth or make any changes? How can we understand the expressions that people have come up with. The very notion i just saw on a tv show that "art is to speak to human experience" thats entertainment, very often art is a critique on the sociological limitations of the present, Surpassed presumptions gone dogmatic and absurd. Creativity finds a new and only angle to proceed on the lullied masses. If that exactly is subjectivity and if any criticism is discarded as subjectivity how can we get out of consumption?? 
“We are not part of neither spirituality or politics air and bubbles and its one billion imbecilic disciples. We consider nature art evolution and civilization is MATTER and MATTER will prove spirituality and politics and it CAN and WILL work properly. AS BEFIT OUR INTELLIGENCE. There is either decay or a magnicident PLOT. Here it is, or it WONT BE. You need this. Or you’ll get NOWHERE.”
"It is even so treu that you can't even FORM an opinion, NOR ABSORB something if you say everything is subjective, or even remotely subjective, and thats what we have here, billions of autistic zombies and their minimalist subjects hive filled with some who have some semblance of idenitity and all idiots with big kitchens. But you don't really have much opportunity in this hive with art intelligence philosophy spirituality or formal things, principles honour, loyalty or any of the good shit."to be clear with subjectivity we don't mean the plurality of opinions or creativity, We are  big proponents of all bright opinions and we are big proponents of all creativity, iWe are talking about subjectivity as a positivist philosophical construct which was adopted by immanuel Kant and which created modern society, to be known office buildings, banks, archeology, etc. which was done by the consideration there is an object to each a subject and we can not know what is behind it. I argue therefore also in my manifest for that, that there are not one but TWO subjectivities, namely the difference of opinion and the consensus created in an anonymous, solipsistic, minimal and non artisan design, non decorative. This is just a matter of fixing words. If you don't agree i doubt you can hold your words to be meaningfull. I talked to poets and i been in the word crisis myself. Its vital to keep a word sticking to reality or all these things will just circle at random in your mind without making a single bit of sense.

subjectivity to me could be considered as a main thread through society with its peak in the symbolist movement, and decaying with the 1930's 40's into solipsism and existentialism, to have different opinions is a completely different thing i'm talking about the culture as a whole, i admit it can be confusing I mean i'd polemicize on the notion of christian dogmatism if someone is giving bread to the poor then i'm not going to be an opponent of that, here i am evaluating subjectivity not someone who happened to have gotten to an actual opinion  There were always opinions or deviations or fruitfull endeavors of any culture. That does not mean the culture and or its dogma’s and its pitfalls should n’t be adressed. Then where it used to be Christianity or Communism to be provoked, now we have the awh whatever person, with his sheep brain, to be provoked, we have come to the bear essence. What is society and what is beauty? And now this awh whatever person stands idle among a provocation which is only art, and without which art could not be possible. A bear essence now, of people, masses, who will always be too late for the new philosophy, and who contempt anyone who thinks differently from them in their midst. In individualism misanthropy and lack of coherence to the majority becomes the only bleak feat a wise man has to look forward to. Perpetually scoffed by these sheep brains in the self indulgence of his own brilliance. Yes in scoffing him, people will find a theter in their own bleak existence, they can swirl themselves to their next kick, their next deep breath so soon as he comes about with his staff of wisdom, they can break it and have something to do. This is terribly enjoyable to them. That or they are home kitchen and garden philosophers who will at last see any philosophy as either moderatly enjoyable or at long last futile “mental masturbation” who don’t get the gist of anything you say and fail to see a thread in the course of philosophy, history, the history of philosophy, and the society it today has left behind. This bleak reality then. With its social toxin, its backward liquor of the social and the “owh thats all” “owh its not much at all” this derogatory opposed to the provocative, the passionate, the innovative, the characteristic. Our audience now dispersed, isolated, in this pit of screams.
