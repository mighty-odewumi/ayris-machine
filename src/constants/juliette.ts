Twas at Panthemont we were brought up, Justine and I, 
there that we received our education. The name of that cele- 
brated retreat is not unfamiliar to you; nor does it require telling 
that for many a long year the prettiest and most libertine women 
gracing Paris have regularly emerged from that convent. Euphro- 
sine, the young lady in whose footsteps I was eager to follow and 
who, dwelling close by my own parents’ home, had fled her father’s 
household to fling herself into libertinage, had been my boon 
companion at Panthemont. As ’twas from her and from a certain 
nun, a friend of hers, that I acquired the basic precepts of the 
morality which, as you listened to the tales my sister has just 
finished recounting, you were somewhat surprised to find in a person 
of my young years, it would seem to me that before anything else I 
ought to tell you something about those women, and to provide 
you with a circumstantial account of those earlier moments of my 
life when, seduced, corrupted by that pair of sirens, the seed des- 
tined to flower into vices without number was sown in the depths 
of my soul. 

The nun I refer to was called Madame Delbéne. For five 
years she had been the abbess of the house and was nearing her 
thirtieth year when I made her acquaintance. To be prettier than 
she were a thing impossible; a fit model to any artist, she had a 
sweet, celestial countenance, fair tresses, large blue eyes where 
shone something tender and inviting, a figure copied after one of 
the Graces. The victim of others’ ambition, young Delbéne had 
been shut up in a cloister at the age of twelve in order that an elder 
brother, whom she detested, might be rendered wealthier by the 
dowry their parents were thus spared from having to set aside for 
her. Imprisoned at an age when the passions begin to assert them-

selves clamorously, although none of this had been of her choosing, 
for she’d then been fond of the world and of men in general, it 
was only by mastering herself, by coming triumphant through the 
severest tests, that she at last decided to give over ard obey. Very 
precocious, having conned all the philosophers, having meditated 
prodigiously, Delbéne, while accepting this condemnation to re- 
tirement, had all the same kept two or three friends by her. They 
came to visit her, to console her; and as she was exceedingly rich, 
they continued to furnish her all the literature and all the delights 
she could desire, even those which were to do the most to fire her 
imagination, already very lively and little cooled by the effects of 
seclusion. 

As for Euphrosinz, she was fifteen when I became attached 
to her; and she had been Madame Delbene’s pupil a year and a 
half when the two of them proposed that I enter their society— 
it was the same day I entered into my thirteenth year. Euphrosine’s 
complexion was somewhite less than white, she was tall for her age, 
very slender, had engaging eyes, considerable spirit and vivacity, 
but in looks she was no match for our Superior, and was far less 
interesting. 

I have no need to say that among recluse women the thirst 
for the voluptuous is tke sole motive for close friendship: they are 
attached one to the other, not by virtue, but by fucking: one is 
pleased by her who soiks one at sight, one becomes the intimate 
of her by whom one is frigged. Endowed with the most energetic 
temperament, I had, s:arting at the age of nine, accustomed my 
fingers to respond to whatever desires arose in my mind, and from 
that period onward I aspired to nothing but the happiness of finding 
the occasion for instruction and to launch myself into a career the 
gates unto which my native forwardness had already flung wide, 
and with such agreeabl«: effects. Euphrosine and Delbéne were soon 
to offer me what I was seeking. Eager to undertake my education, 
the Superior one day invited me to luncheon. Euphrosine was there: 
the weather was incredibly warm, and this excessive ardor of the 
sun afforded them an excuse for the disarray I found them in: 
apart from an undergarment of transparent lawn maintained by 
nothing more than a large bow of pink ribbon, they were perfectly 
naked. 


Juliette & § 


“Since you first arrived at this establishment,” Madame 
Delbéne began, kissing me rather carelessly upon the forehead, 
her eye and hand betraying a certain restlessness, ‘‘] have had an 
unabating desire to make your intimate acquaintance. You are 
very attractive. You appear to me to be in possession of some wit 
and aptitude, and young maids of your sort have a very definite 
place in my heart—do you blush, little angel? But I forbid you 
to blush! Modesty is an illusion——resulting from what? ’tis the 
result of nought but our cultural manners and our upbringing, it 
is what is known as a conventional habit. Nature having created 
man and woman naked, it is unthinkable that she could have 
implanted in them an aversion or a shame thus to appear. Had man 
only faithfully observed Nature’s promptings, he would never have 
fallen subject to modesty: the which iron-clad truth, my heart, 
proves that there are certain virtues whose source lies nowhere 
save in total negligence, or ignorance, of the code of Nature. Ah, 
but might one not give a wrench to Christian morals were one in 
this way to scrutinize all the articles which compose it! But 
we'll chat about that later on. Let’s speak of other matters for 
the nonce. Will you join us in our undress ?” 

Then those two minxes, laughing merrily, stepped up to me 
and soon had me in a state identical to theirs; whereupon Madame 
Delbéne’s kisses assumed a completely different character. 

‘Oh, but my Juliette is lovely!” cried she, admiringly; “see 
how those delicious little breasts have begun to heave! Euphrosine, 
I do declare she’s better fleshed there than you are . . . and, would 
you believe it? she’s barely thirteen.” 

Our charming Superior’s fingers were tickling my nipples, 
and her tongue quivered in my mouth. She was not slow to observe 
her caresses were having so powerful an influence upon my senses 
that I was in serious danger of being entirely overcome. 

“O fuck!” she apostrophized, unable to restrain herself and 
startling me with the vigor of her expressions. ‘‘Ah, by sweet 
Christ! what verve, what a fiery temper! Let’s be rid of all these 
damnable hindrances, my little friends, to the devil with every- 
thing that yet screens from clear view charms Nature never 
created to remain hidden!” 

And directly flinging away the filmy costume which had en- 


6 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


veloped her, she revealed herself to our eyes, lovely as Venus, 
that sea-risen goddess who exacted homage from the Greeks. It 
were impossible to be better formed, to have a skin more white, 
more sweet, to have more beauteous curves, forms better pro- 
nounced. Euphrosine, who imitated her almost at once, delivered 
fewer charms to my view: she was less plump than Madame 
Delbéne; rather darkzr in her skin, she ‘would perhaps have 
pleased less universally ; but what eyes! what vivacity! Stirred by 
such a quantity of wonders, earnestly solicited by the two women 
they belonged to, besought to follow their example and be rid of 
all modesty’s restraints, you may be very certain that I yielded. 
Her head reeling from sublimest drunkenness, Delbéne bore me 
to her bed and devoured me with her kisses. 

“One moment,” she panted, wholly ablaze, ‘one moment, my 
dears, we had best introduce a little method into our pleasures’ 
madness: they’re not relished unless organized.” 

So saying, she stretches me out, spreads wide my legs and, 
lying belly down upon the bed with her head lodged between my 
thighs, she sets to cunt-sucking me, the while exposing the world’s 
most handsome buttocks to my companion’s view, from that pretty 
little girl’s fingers she receives the same services her tongue is 
rendering me. Euphros:ne knowing full well what was apt to flatter 
Delbéne’s tastes, amidst her pollutions interspersed sharp slaps 
upon the nun’s behind: they had an indubitable effect upon our 
amiable instructress’ physical being. Quite electrified by libertine 
proceedings, the whore bolted the whey she was making squirt in a 
steady stream from my little cunt. Now and again she paused to 
gaze at me, to contemplate me in these throes of pleasure. 

“The beautiful creature!’ the tribade exclaimed. “Oh, great 
God, was there ever a more inspiring child! Have at it, Euphrosine, 
frig me, my love, lay on, I want to die drunk on her fuck! Quick 
now, we'll change about, let’s vary what we’re doing,” she cried 
a moment later; “you must wish for something in return, dear 
Euphrosine ? But how shall I be able to repay you for the pleasures 
you're giving me! Wait, wait, little angels, I’m going to frig you 
both at the same time.” 

She places us side by side on the bed; following her recommen- 
dation, we each advance a hand and set to polluting each other. 


Juliette & 7 


Delbéne’s tongue first probes far into the recesses of Euphrosine’s 
cunt, and she uses either hand to tickle our assholes; from time to 
time she relinquishes my companion’s cunt so as to pump mine, 
and thus both Euphrosine and I, experiencing three pleasures 
simultaneously, did, as you may be fully persuaded, discharge like 
muskets. Several instants later the resourceful Delbéne has us turn 
over, and we put our asses at her disposal; while frigging us be- 
neath, she applies determined lips to Euphrosine’s anus, then to 
mine, sucking with libidinous choler. She praised our buttocks’ 
conformation, spanking them teasingly, and half slew us with joy. 
When done, she drew away: 

‘Do unto me everything I have done unto you,” spake she in 
a thickened voice, “frig me, the both of you. Frig me. I shall lie 
in your arms, Juliette, I shall kiss your mouth, our tongues shall 
intertwine ... shall strain .. . shall suck. You shall bury this fair 
dildo in my womb,” she pursued, putting the instrument into my 
hands; “and you, my Euphrosine, you shall assume charge of my 
ass, you shall employ this lesser tube to arouse me in that sector: 
infinitely straiter than my cunt, it asks for no bulkier apparatus. . . . 
You, my pigeon,” she went on, kissing me with inordinate feeling, 
“you'll not leave my clitoris unattended, will you? "Tis there the 
true seat of woman’s pleasure: rub it, worry it, I say, use your 
nails if you like—never fear, I know how to bear a little pres- 
sure ... and I am weary, Christ’s eyes! I am jaded and I require 
to be dealt with stoutly: I want to melt absolutely into fuck, fuck 
I want to become, if I am able I want to discharge twenty times 
over. Make it so.” 

Oh, God, with what liberality we did repay her in the one 
coin she valued! It were not in human power more passionately 
to labor at giving a woman pleasure . . . impossible to imagine one 
who had a greater appetite for it. The thing was done at last. 

‘My angel,” that charming creature said to me, “I attempt 
to express my delight at having come to know you, and words fail 
me. You are a veritable discovery, from now on I propose to 
associate you with all my pleasures and you shall find that we may 
avail ourselves of some very poignant ones, despite the fact male 
company is, strictly speaking, forbidden us. Ask of Euphrosine 
whether she is content with me.” 


8 & THE MARQUIS. DE SADE 


“Oh, my beloved, allow my kisses to speak for mel!” ex- 
claimed our young friend as she cast herself upon Delbéne’s breast; 
“tis you I am indebted to for an understanding of myself and of 
the meaning of my existence. You have trained my mind, you have 
rescued it from the darkness wherein childhood prejudices en- 
shrouded it. Thanks alone to you I have achieved being in this 
world. Lucky Juliette, if you will condescend to lavish similar 
attentions upon her!” 

“Yes,” Madame Delbéne replied, ‘why yes, I am anxious to 
take her education in hand. Just as I have told you, I should like 
to cleanse her of all those infamous religious follies which spoil 
the whole of life’s felicity, I should like to guide her back to Na- 
ture’s fold and doctrine and cause her to see that all the fables 
whereby they have sought to bewitch her mind and clog her energies 
are in actuality worthy of nought but derision. But now to luncheon, 
my friends, we'd best refresh ourselves; when one has discharged 
abundantly, what one has expended must be replenished.” 

A delicious collation, which we took entirely naked, soon re- 
stored to us the strength necessary to begin afresh. Once again we 
fell to frigging one another—and immediately were all three 
plunged back into the wildest excesses of lubricity. We struck a 
thousand different poses; continually altering our roles, we were 
sometimes wives to fuckers whom the next instant we dealt with as 
husbands and, thus beguiling Nature, for the length of an entire day 
we compelled thaf inclulgent mother to set the crown of her 
voluptuousness most sweet upon all the little infractions of her 
laws we committed. 

A month was so spent; at its end Euphrosine, her brain nicely 
crazed by libertinage, left the convent, then bade farewell to her 
family and went off to practice all the disorders of frenzied whoring 
and low ticense. Later, she returned and paid us a visit; she figured 
her situation, and we being too corrupted to find anything amiss in 
the career she was pursuing, pity was farthest from our thoughts, 
and our last wish was to discourage her from forging ahead. 

“I must say she has managed very well,” Madame Delbéne 
remarked to me; “a hundred times over I have yearned to respond 
to the same call, and indeed I surely would have, had my taste for 
men been strong enough to surmount this uncommon liking I have 


Juliette 2 9 


for women. However, dear Juliette, in fating me to inhabit the 
cloister all my life long, heaven also had the kindness to provide 
me with only a mediocre desire for any sort of pleasure other than 
those this sanctified place plentifully affords me; that which women 
may mutually procure one another is so delicious that my aspira- 
tions do not go very much farther. Nevertheless, I do recognize 
that one may take an interest in men; it is no mystery to me that 
one will now and then do everything under the sun to lay hands on 
them; whatever is connected with libertinage makes powerful sense 
to me... . My fancy has roved very far. Who knows, perhaps I 
have even gone beyond what one may imagine, have been gripped by 
wants whose satisfaction defies all conception ? 

‘The fundamental tenet of my philosophy, Juliette,” went on 
Madame Delbéne, who, since the loss of Euphrosine, had become 
more and more fond of me, “is scorn for public opinion. You 
simply have no idea, my dear one, to what point I am contemptu- 
ously indifferent to whatever may be said about me. And, pray tell, 
what beneficial or other influence can the vulgar fool’s opinion 
have upon our happiness? Only our overdelicate sensitivity permits 
it to affect us; but if, by dint of stern and clear thinking, we succeed 
in deadening these susceptibilities, eventually reaching the stage 
where opinion’s effects upon us are null, even when it be a question 
of those things which touch us most intimately—then, I say, then 
that the good or bad opinion of others may have any influence 
whatsoever upon our happiness becomes utterly unthinkable. We 
alone can make for our personal felicity : whether we are to be 
happy or unhappy i is completely up to us, it all depends solely upon 
our conscience, and perhaps even more so upon our attitudes which 
alone supply the bedrock foundation to our conscience’s inspira- 
tions. For the human conscience,” continued that deep-learned 
woman, “‘is not at all times and everywhere the same, but rather 
almost always the direct product of a given society’s manners and 
of a particular climate and geography. Is it not so, for example, 
that the same acts the Chinese do not in any sense consider inad- 
missible would cause us to shudder here in France? If then this 
most unrigid organ is, depending merely upon latitude and longi- 
tude, able to excuse and justify any extreme behavior, true wisdom 
must advise us to adopt a rational, a moderate, position between 


10 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


extravagances and chimeras, and to evolve attitudes which will 
prove compatible simultaneously with the penchants we have 
individually received from Nature and with the laws of the 
country we happen to dwell in; and these are the attitudes out of 
which we must elaborate our conscience. And that is why the sooner 
one sets to work adopting the philosophy one intends to be guided 
by, the better, since that philosophy alone supplies its form to the 
conscience, and our conscience is responsible for governing and 
regulating all the actions we perform in life.” 

“Heavens!” I cried, “have you carried indifference to the 
point of not caring in the slightest about your reputation ?”” 

“Quite, I do not care about it in the slightest,” Madame 
Delbéne answered. “I might even confess that I take a greater 
inner pleasure from my conviction that this reputation is extremely 
bad than I would reap from knowing it was good. Oh, Juliette, 
never forget this: a good reputation is a valueless encumbrance. 
It cannot ever recompense us for what in sacrifice it costs us. She 
who prizes her good reputation is subject to at least as many 
torments as she who behaves neglectfully of it: the first lives in 
unceasing dread of losing what is precious to her, the other trembles 
before the prospects opened up by her own carelessness. If thus 
the paths conducting the one to virtue and the other to vice are 
equally bestrewn with briars, why is it that we subject ourselves 
to such vexations in selecting between these ways, why do we not 
consult Nature and loyaily observe her directives ?” 

“But,” I objected, “were I to make these maxims mine, 
Madame Delbene, I greatly fear I should have to flout far too 
many conventions.” 

‘‘Why indeed, my dear,” she retorted, “I believe I’d prefer 
to have you tell me you greatly fear you'd taste too many pleasures. 
And what precisely are these conventions? Shall we inspect the 
matter soberly? Social ordinances in virtually every instance are 
promulgated by those who never deign to consult the members of 
society, they are restrictions we all of us cordially hate, they are 
common sense’s contradictions: absurd myths lacking any reality 
save in the eyes of the fools who don’t mind submitting to them, 
fairy tales which in the eyes of reason and intelligence merit scorn 
only. ... We'll have more to say on that subject, you have but to 


Juliette & 11 


wait a little, my dear. Have confidence in me. Your candor and 
naivete indicate you are in singular need of a tutor. For very few 
is life a bed of roses: only heed me, and you'll be one of those who, 
with the thorns that must be there, will find a goodly number of 
flowers in her path.” 

Seldom indeed does one come across a reputation in shabbier 
repair than this one of Madame Delbéne. A nun who held me in 
especially high esteem, being disturbed by my rapport with the 
Abbess, warned me that she was a doomed woman. She had, I was 
told, poisoned the minds of nearly every pensionnaire in the convent, 
and thanks to her advice at least fifteen or sixteen of them had 
already gone the way of Euphrosine. It was, she assured me, an 
unprincipled, lawless, a faithless, an impudent brazen creature 
who flaunted her wicked notions; vigorous measures would long 
ere this have been taken against her were it not for her influential 
position and distinguished birth. These exhortations meant nothing 
to me: a single one of Delbéne’s kisses, a single phrase from her 
had a greater effect upon me than all the weapons it were possible 
to employ with a view to sundering us. Even had it meant being 
dragged over the precipice, it seemed to me I should have pre- 
ferred definitive ruin at her side to celebrity in another’s sight. Oh, 
my friends! there is a certain perversity than which no other 
nourishment is tastier ; drawn thither by Nature... if for a moment 
Reason’s glacial hand waves us back, Lust’s fingers bear the dish 
toward us again, and thereafter we can no longer do without that 
fare. 

But it was not long before I noticed our amiable Superior’s 
attentions were not concentrated exclusively on me, and I as 
quickly perceived that others were wont to cooperate with her in 
exercises where libertinage had a more preponderant share than 

iety. 

“And will you take lunch with me tomorrow?” she inquired 
one day. “I ‘expect Elizabeth, Flavie, Madame de Volmar and 
Madame de Sainte-Elme. We'll be six in all; we ought surely to be 
able to accomplish some truly startling things, I dare say.” 

“Goodness!’’ I exclaimed. ‘‘Do you amuse yourself with all 
those women ?” 

“Of course. But you mustn't for one instant suppose I am 


12 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


limited to them. There are thirty nuns in our establishment, I have 
had commerce with twenty-two; we have eighteen novices: I have 
still to make the acquaintance of one of them; and of the sixty 
pensionnaires presently with us, only three have resisted me so far. 
Whenever a new one arrives I simply have to get my hands on 
her: I accord her one week, never longer, to think over my pro- 
posals. Oh, Juliette, Juliette, my libertinage is an epidemic, whoso- 
ever is in my vicinity is bound to be infected by it. How very 
fortunate for society that I restrict myself to this dilute form of 
evil-doing: oh, what with my proclivities and principles, I could 
perhaps adopt another which might easily prove more of a nuisance 
to the world.” 

‘And what would vou do, my gentlest one?” 

‘Who can tell? Do you not realize that the effects of an 
imagination so depraved as mine are like unto the impetuous waters 
of a river in flood? Nature wouldst that it wreak destruction, and 
destroy it does, no matter what, no matter how.” 

‘Do you not ascribe to Nature,” I suggested to my interlocu- 
tress, ‘‘what ought rather to be considered the result of your dep- 
ravation?” 

“Now heed me well, little light of my life,” said the Superior; 

“it’s early yet, our friends aren’t due to come till six and before 
they arrive I can perhaps reply to some of your frivolous notions.’ 

We both sat down. 

“In that our unique knowledge of Nature’s inspirations,” 
began Madame Delbéne, “reaches us through that interior sensory 
we call the conscience, it is by analyzing this latter we shall ration- 
ally and profitably sound Nature’s operations—which, in us, are 
impulsions—and which fatigue, torment, or bring enjoyment to 
the conscience. 

“The word conscierce, my beloved Juliette, denominates that 
as it were inner voice which cries out when we do something—it 
makes no difference what—we are forbidden to do: and this 
eminently simple definition lays bare, to even the most casual 
glance, the origins the :onscience has in prejudices inculeated by 
training and upbringing. Thus it is the child is beset by guilt 
directly he disobeys instructions—and the child will continue to 
suffer pangs of remors: until such time as, having vanquished 


Juliette & 13 


prejudice, he discovers there is no real evil in the thing his education 
has induced him to abhor. 

“And so conscience is purely and simply the construction either 
of the prejudices that are insinuated into us or of the ethical 
principles we ourselves devise in our own behalf. So true is this 
that it is altogether possible, if for material we employ sensitive 
principles, to forge a conscience which will haunt and sting and bite 
us, afflict us most woundingly upon every occasion—it is, I say, 
quite possible that we find ourselves possessed of a conscience so 
tyrannical that, once having promised ourselves to execute them 
for the sake of our sensual gratification, we then fail to carry out in 
their fullest and richest details any however entertaining schemes, 
even vicious ones, exceedingly criminal ones. Whence it is there 
is engendered, as antidote to the first, that other sort of conscience 
which, in the person who stands aloof from superstition and vulgar 
claptrap, speaks angrily to him when by miscalculation or self-decep- 
tion he chooses to come at happiness by some other road than the 
highway which must naturally lead him to his object. Hence, in 
the light of the principles we have devised for our own individual 
use, we may equally well have cause to repent at having done either 
too much evil, or too little, or none. But let us take the word in 
its most elementary and most common acceptation: in this case, 
guilt—that is to say, what prompts the utterances of the inner 
mechanism we have just designated as the conscience—in this case, 
guilt is a perfectly useless debility, a weakness whose grip upon us 
we have got to break with all possible dispatch and with all the 
determination we can muster. For feelings of guilt, once again, are 
nought but the distillations, the effluvia of a prejudice produced 
by fear of what may befall us for having done any conceivable 
kind of thing forbidden for who knows what vague or flimsy 
reason. Remove the threat of retribution, alter opinions, abolish 
civil codes, shift the felon from one clime to another, and the mis- 
deed will, of course, remain exactly in substance what before it was, 
but he who commits it will no longer feel twinges of guilt over his 
act. Guilt, thus, is merely an unpleasant reminiscence; it crops out 
of the customs and conventions one happens to have adopted, but it 
never results from, never has any connection with, the character 
of the deed one happens to have performed. 


14 <> THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘Were this not so, how could one ever succeed in stifling re- 
morse, in overcoming guilt? And we may be very certain that even 
when it be a question of acts of the broadest consequence, 
stifled they definitely may be, provided one’s mental development 
is suficient and provided one has toiled earnestly to extinguish 
one’s. prejudices. Proportionately as these prejudices are extirpated 
by maturity, or as habitual familiarity with deeds that initially 
upset us gradually toughens the sensibility and subdues the con- 
science, the susceptibility to guilt, formerly but the effect of the 
conscience’s frailty, is s9on diminished, finally annihilated: and 
thus one progresses, until one arrives at the most appalling excesses: 
they may be repeated as 9ften as one likes. But, it may perhaps be 
objected, guilt feelings ure surely more or less intense in keep- 
ing with the variety of the misdeed perpetrated? Yes, to be sure, 
since the prejudice against a major crime is more powerful than 
one against a lesser crime, and the punishment prescribed by the law 
commensurately heavier in the one instance than in the other; 
however, discover the st-ength indiscriminately to do away with 
all prejudices, acquire the wisdom to rank all crimes on a single 
plane, and, becoming swiftly convinced of their resemblance, you 
will know how to tailor guilt to fit the occasion. Which is only to 
say that, having first learned to cope with the guilt consequent 
upon petty misbehavior, you will soon learn to quell any uneasi- 
ness over having performed a sizable atrocity, and to learn also 
to execute every atrocity, great and small, with a constant and 
inviolable serenity. ... 

‘And so it is, my dear Juliette, that if one is visited by mis- 
givings after having done a fell deed, that is because one clings to 
some doctrine of freedom or of free will, saying to oneself: How 
wretched I am because I clidn’t act otherwise! But were one really 
to wish to persuade oneself that this talk about freedom is all 
empty prattle and that we are driven to whatever we do by a force 
more puissant than ourselves; were one to wish to be convinced 
that everything in this world has its purpose and its utility, and 
that the crime whereof one repents is just as necessary to Nature’s 
grand design as are war, the plague, famine by which she periodi- 
cally lays whole émpires waste—and empires are infinitely less 
dependent than Nature upon the acts that comprise our individual 


Juliette & 15 


existences—were we to make these efforts, we’d cease even to 
be able to conceive of remorse or guilt, and my precious Juliette 
would not say to me that I am mistaken in laying up to Nature’s 
will that which ought only to be regarded as depravity’s handiwork. 

‘All moral effects,’ Madame Delbéne went on, ‘‘are to be 
related to physical causes, unto which they are linked most abso- 
lutely: the drumstick strikes the taut-drawn skin and the sound 
answers the blow: no physical cause, that is, no collision, and of 
necessity there’s no moral effect, that is, no noise. Certain dis- 
positions peculiar to our organisms, the neural fluids more or less 
irritated by the nature of the atoms we inhale, by the species or 
quantity of the nitrous particles contained in the foods making up 
our diet, by the flow of the humours and by yet a thousand other 
external causes—this is what moves a person to crime or to virtue 
and often, within the space of a single day, to both. There’s the 
drumhead struck, the cause of a vicious or of a virtuous act; one 
hundred /ouis stolen out of my neighbor’s pocket or transferred as 
a gift from mine to someone in need, there’s the effect of the blow, 
the resultant sound. Are we answerable for these subsequent effects 
when the initial causes necessitate them? May the drum be beaten 
without there being a sound emitted? And can we avoid these 
reverberations when they and the blow are themselves the conse- 
quence of things so beyond our control, so exterior to ourselves, 
and so dependent upon the manner in which we are personally 
constituted? And so ’tis madness, ’tis true extravagance to refrain 
from doing whatever we please, and, having done it, to repent 
thereof. Thus guilt and remorse appear as pusillanimous frailties 
we ought not to encourage, but to combat to the very best of our 
ability and overcome by means of sane deliberation, reason, and 
habit. Will remorse alter the fact the milk’s been spilt? no, and so 
we might as well dry our tears: remorse does nothing to make 
the act less evil, since remorse always comes after the fact; very 
rarely does remorse prevent the fact from recurring. Therefore, I 
must conclude that remorse is futile. The evil act once committed, 
one of two things must follow: either the act is punished, or it is 
not. In the second hypothesis, to feel sorry would assuredly be the 
height of stupidity: for what is the point of repenting any con- 
ceivable sort of deed which has given us the very completest

satisfaction, and whence we have endured no painful consequences ? 
In such a case, to regret the harm this act may have caused some- 
one else would be to love him more than one’s own self, and it is 
perfectly ridiculous to grieve over the sufferings of others when 
their pain has procured us pleasure, when it has been of some use 
or profit to us, when it has tickled, titillated, aroused, delighted 
us in whatever may be the manner. Hence, in this case, there is no 
earthly excuse for remorse. 

“If, on the other hand, the act is discovered amd punishment 
ensues, then, if one chooses to view the matter objectively, one 
will recognize that what we now repent is not the hurt caused 
someone else by our act, but our clumsiness in allowing it to be 
found out—and presently one has grounds for regret, yes, and 
should surely ponder the thing . . . simply in order, from lengthy 
reflection upon one’s misadventure, to realize that in the future 
one must be prudent—if the punishment inflicted upon one is any- 
thing short of capital. But these reflections are not to be confused 
with remorse, for true remorse, real remorse, is the pain produced 
by the hurt one has done oneself: which distinction brings to light 
the vast difference subsisting between these two sentiments, and at 
the same time reveals the usefulness of the one and the inanity of 
the other. 

“When we indulge in a bit of foul play, however atrocious, 
the satisfaction it affords, or the profit it yields, is ample consolation 
for the trouble, however acute, which amusing ourselves may 
bring down upon the heac! of some one or more of our fellow men. 
Prior to performing the deed, do we not clearly foresee the in- 
conveniences it will cause others? Of course; and this thought, 
rather than doing anythin; to stop us, usually spurs us on. And then 
the deed once done, suddenly and belatedly to fall prey to worry, to 
start to fret, to sweat, to allow scruple to hinder one from savoring 
pleasure—than this there is no greater nor baser folly. If because 
it has been detected this deed brings us unhappiness in its wake, 
let us bend our keener faculties to ferreting out the reasons why it 
came to public intelligence ; and without shedding a superfluous tear 
over something we are powerless to arrange otherwise, let us 
mobilize every effort so that the next time we shall not be wanting 
in tact, let us turn this mishap to our advantage, and from this 


Juliette 17 


reversal draw the experience necessary to improve our methods: 
henceforth, we will ensure our impunity by swathing our irregular- 
ities in thicker veils and more entire obscurity. But let us not con- 
trive, by means of purposeless remorse, to extirpate sound 
principles; for this bad behavior, this depravation, these vicious 
and criminal and abominable caprices, are precious attributes, they 
have procured us pleasure, have delighted us, and unwise is he 
who deprives himself of anything he enjoys—that would be similar 
to the lunacy of the man who, merely because a heavy dinner 
troubled his digestion, were to abjure forever the pleasures of good 
eating. 

‘Veritable wisdom, my dear Juliette, consists not in repressing. 
one’s vices, for, vices constituting, practically speaking, the sole 
happiness granted us in life, so to do would be to adopt the role, as 
it were, of one’s own executioner. The true and approved way is to 
surrender oneself to them, to practice them to the utmost, but with 
care enough and circumspection to be secured against the dangers of 
surprise. Fear not lest precautions and protective contrivances di- 
minish your pleasure: mystery only adds thereto. Such conduct, 
furthermore, guarantees impunity; and is not impunity the most 
piquant aliment to debauchery ? 

“After having taught you how to deal with the remorse born 
of the pain one suffers from having done evil rather too conspicu- 
ously, it is of the essence, dear little friend, that you permit me now 
to indicate‘ the manner of totally silencing that inner and confusion- 
breeding voice which, when thirsts have been slaked, wakes now 
and again to upbraid us for the follies into which passions have 
plunged us. Well, this cure is quite as sweet as it is sure, for it 
consists simply in reiterating the deeds that have made us remorse- 
ful, in repeating them so often that the habit either of committing 
these deeds or of getting away scot free with them completely 
undermines every possibility of feeling badly about them. This 
habit topples the prejudice, destroys it; it does more: by frequently 
exercising the sensibility in the very way and in the very situation 
which, at the outset, made it suffer, this habit at length makes the 
new state it has assumed wholly bearable and even delicious to the 
soul. Pride lends its aid: not only have you done something no one 
else would ever dare do, you have become so accustomed to doing 


18 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it that you cannot anymore exist without it—there is one pleasure. 
The enacted deed produces another; and who is there doubts that 
this multiplying of delights very speedily induces a soul to adopt 
the lineaments and character it has got to have, however painful at 
first may have been the difficulties wherewith, perforce, it was 
beset by the deed in question? 

‘““‘Do we not experience when performing any one of the 
alleged crimes in which lust is dominant the very sensations I have 
cited to you? Why is it one never repents a crime of libertinage? 
Because libertinage very soon becomes habitual. Thus may it be 
in the case of every other extravagance; like lubricity, they may all 
be readily transformed into custom, and like lewdness, each of 
them may provoke an agreeable vibration in the nerve fluids: this 
poignant itching, closely resembling passion, may become quite as 
delectable and consequently, like it, metamorphose into a primary 
need. 

“Oh, Juliette! if like myself you would live happily in crime— 
and, my beloved, I am wont to indulge heavily therein—if, I say, 
you would find in crime the same happiness that is mine, then strive 
as time passes to make of evil-doing a habit, until, with the passing 
of time, you have become so endeared to the habit that you literally 
cannot go on without imbibing of this potent drink, and until every 
man-made convention appears so ridiculous to your consideration 
that your pliant but nonetheless sinewy soul becomes gradually 
accustomed to construing as vices all human virtues, and as virtu- 
ous whatever mortals call criminal: do this, and lo! as though 
miraculously, new perspectives, a new universe shall appear before 
you, a consuming and delicious conflagration will glide into your 
nerves, it will make boil the electrically charged liquor in which 
the life principle has its seat. Fortunate enough to be able to dwell 
in a mundane society whence my sad fate has exiled me, with 
every new day you will form fresh projects, and their realization 
will every day overwhelm you with a sensual euphoria such as none 
but you shall know anything of. All the persons, all the creatures 
about you shall look to you like so many victims destiny has led 
up in fetters to sate your heart's perversity. No more duties, no 
more hampering ties, no more obstacles to impede you, they'll all 
vanish in a trice, dissolved by the vehemence of your desires. No 


Juliette 19 


longer from the depths of your soul shall any voice speak reproach- 
fully, hoping to impair your vigor and rob you of joy. Nevermore 
shall prejudice militate against your happiness, wisdom shall abol- 
ish every check, and with even stride you shall walk along a path- 
way strewn thick with flowers, till finally you accede to perversity’s 
ultimate excesses. It will be then you'll perceive the weakness of 
what in days past they described to you as Nature’s dictates; when 
you shall have spent a few years winking at what imbeciles term her 
laws, when, in order to become familiar with their infraction, it 
shall have pleased you to pulverize them all, then you'll behold her, 
that Nature, a wicked smile on her lips, thrilled half to death at 
having been violated, you'll see the quean/melt before your im- 
pulsive desires, you'll see her come crawling toward you, begging 
to be shackled by your irons . . . she'll stretch forth her wrists, 
plead to be your captive; now a slave to you instead of your 
sovereign, subtly she’ll instruct your heart in what fashion to out- 
rage her further yet; as though degradation were her whole de- 
light, only by showing you how to insult her excessively will she 
demonstrate her ability to impose her governance upon you. Let 
her. When once you reach that stage, do not resist, ever; as soon 
as you have discovered the way to seize Nature, insatiable in her 
demands upon you, she will lead you on, step by step, from irregular- 
ity to irregularity: all are preparatory, the last committed will 
never be but progress accomplished toward still another by means 
whereof she prepares to submit to you yet again; like unto the 
whore of Sybaris, who will put on every shape so as to excite the 
lust of him who buys her, she will in like wise teach you a hundred 
ways to soil and vanquish her, and all that the more completely to 
ensnare you in her turn, the more utterly to make you her own. 
However, one single hint of resistance, let me repeat, one reluctant 
gesture were fatal: it will cost you the loss of all you have won by 
complacency heretofore: yield: unless you acquaint yourself with 
everything, you'll know nothing; and if you’re so timid as te pause 
in your conversation with her, Nature will escape you forever. 
Above all, beware of religion, nothing is more apt to lure you 
astray than religion’s baneful insinuations. Comparable to the 
Hydra whose heads grow back as swiftly as they are lopped off, it 
will unceasingly debilitate you if you falter at the task of obliter- 


20 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ating its principles. There is the danger ever present that some 
bizarre ideas of the fantastical God wherewith they befouled your 
childhood return again to disturb your maturer imagination while 
it is in the midst of its divinest heats. Oh, Juliette! forget it, scorn 
it, the concept of this vain and ludicrous God. His existence is a 
shadow instantly to be dissipated by the least mental effort, and 
you shall never know any peace so long as this odious chimera 
preserves any of its prize upon your soul which error would give 
to it in bondage. Refer yourself again and again to the great 
theses of Spinoza, of Vanini, of the author of Le Systeme de 
la Nature. We will study them, we will analyze them together, I 
promised you authoritative dissertations upon this subject and I am 
going to keep my word: both of us shall feast heartily upon these 
writers and shall fill ourselves with the spirit of their sage opin- 
ions. Should you be visited by further doubts, you shall communi- 
cate them to me, I will set your mind at rest. Grown as staunch and 
doughty as I in your thinking, you'll soon be imitating me in action, 
and like myself, you'll never more pronounce this loathsome God’s 
name save with revulsion and in hateful blasphemy. The very 
conceiving of this so infinitely disgusting phantom is, I confess it, 
the one wrong I am unable to forgive man. I excuse him all his 
whims, his ironies, and his eccentricities, I sympathize with all his 
frailties, but I cannot smile tolerantly upon the lunacy that could 
erect this monster, I do not pardon man for having himself 
wrought those religious chains which have so dreadfully hobbled 
him and for having crept despicably forward, eyes downcast and 
neck stretched forth, to receive the shameful collar manufactured 
only by his own stupidity. There would be no end to it, Juliette, 
were I to give vent to all the horror waked in me by the execrable 
doctrine based upon a God’s existence; mere mention of him rouses 
my ire, when I hear his name pronounced I seem to see all around 
me the palpitating shades of all those woebegone creatures this 
abominable opinion has slaughtered on the face of the earth. Those 
ghosts cry out beseechingly to me, they supplicate me to make use 
of all I have been endowed with of force and ingenuity to erase 
from the souls of my brethren the idea of the revolting chimera 
which has brought such rue into the world.” 


Juliette & 21 


At this point Madame Delbéne asked me how far I had my- 
self proceeded in these matters. 

“I have not yet made my first communion,” I answered her. 

“So much the better!”’ said she, folding me in her arms. ‘“‘Ex- 
cellent, my little angel, I'll preserve you from that idolatrous rite. 
With what regards confession, reply, when they question you, that 
you are not prepared to recite. The mother in charge of the 
novices is my friend, her position depends upon my favor, I shall 
recommend you to her and they'll leave you strictly alone. As for 
Mass, we've got to appear there in spite of our wishes; but, one 
moment, do you see that pretty little assortment of books?” she 
asked, pointing to some thirty-odd volumes bound in red morocco; 
“I shall lend you those works. Read them during the abominable 
sacrifice. They will in some sort alleviate the obligation of having 
to be witness to the whole miserable ceremony.” 

“Oh, my friend!” I exclaimed, “how deeply in your debt I 
shall be! My heart and mind were already advanced in the direction 
your advice indicates I should take. .. . I had a head start—not, 
to be sure, with respect to morals, for the things you have just 
told me are so very novel, and so engaging—I had no previous 
inkling of them, truly. But at a very early hour I began to abhor 
religion, just as you do, and it was only with extremest aversion I 
fulfilled its duties. Oh, can you divine the pleasure you give me in 
promising to broaden my understanding! Alas! having until now 
heard nothing philosophical said about these matters of supersti- 
tion, I owe all my modest store of impiety to Nature’s liberal 
suggestions.” 

“Ah! obey her promptings, my darling—they’re such as shall 
never mislead you.” 

“Do you know,” I continued, “the lecture you have just given 
me, it is a very compelling one . . . full of bold ideas. May I say 
that it is rare to find one so well informed at your age? Allow me 
to tell you so, my dear: I find it hard to believe a person’s conscience 
can reach the state which, by your description, it is plain yours has 
attained, without that person having acquitted herself of a num- 
ber of most extraordinary feats. And how—forgive me for putting 
the question to you—how have you found the opportunity to 


22 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


perpetrate outrages capable of inwardly toughening you to this 
degree ?” 

“The day will come when you shall know everything about 
me,” said the Superior. rising from her chair. 

‘‘And why must it be postponed ? are you afraid of—” 

“Merely of horri:ying you.” 

“Then fear not, my friend.” 

But the approach of company prevented Delbene from en- 
lightening me touching what I was afire to know. 

“Tush,” said she, putting a finger to her lips, “let’s turn our 
thoughts to pleasure. |iss me, Juliette. I promise to confide in you 
on some later day.” 

Our associates had arrived; I must portray them for you. 

Madame de Volmar had taken the veil only six months before. 
Just twenty years old, tall, slender, very fair of skin, with chestnut 
hair, the loveliest bocy imaginable: Volmar, blessed with such a 
host of charms, was understandably one of Madame Delbeéne’s 
most cherished disciples and, excepting only the latter, the most 
libertine of the ladies who were about to participate in our orgies. 

Saint-Elme was a novice of seventeen, very animated, with a 
charming countenance, sparkling eyes, well-molded breasts, and 
an air of general voluptuousness. Elizabeth and Flavie were both 
pensionnaires: the first could not have been past thirteen, the 
second was sixteen. Elizabeth’s face was sensitive, her features 
were unusually delicate; the lines of her body were agreeable to 
see, its curves already afhirmed. As for Flavie, she had surely the 
most heavenly face ore could hope to find in this world: nowhere 
did there exist a prett.er smile, lovelier teeth, more beautiful hair; 
nor was there another who possessed a more engaging figure, a 
softer and clearer skin. Ah, my friends! had I to paint the Goddess 
of Flowers, ’twould b: Flavie I'd select for my model. 

The introductions and the customary compliments were with- 
out undue formality; each member of the society, fully aware of 
what had motivated the forgathering, was impatient to proceed to 
business; but those ladies’ exchanges did, I must declare, astonish 
me. Even in the middle of a brothel one is not likely to overhear 
libertine language more gracefully and more casually pronounced 
than it was by these voung women; and nothing could have been 


Juliette % 23 


more pleasant than the contrast between their modest demeanor, 
their reserve abroad, and the energetic indecency they displayed 
throughout these luxurious assemblies. 

“Delbéne,” said Madame Volmar upon making her en- 
trance, “I defy you to wheedle me into discharging today—oh, but 
I’m done up, my dear, I was the night rioting with Fontenille. I 
worship the little rascal, in all my life no one ever frigged me more 
competently, I’ve never parted with so much fuck, nor so often, no, 
nor with such delight. Ah, my adorable one, we accomplished 
marvels!” 

“Amazing, aren’t they?” Delbéne remarked; ‘‘well, I trust 
we'll perform a few a thousand times more extraordinary this 
afternoon.” 

“Fuck my eyes! then let’s have at it!” cried Sainte-Elme. “I’m 
stifi—I’m not like Volmar, I slept alone,” and, raising her skirts, 
“do you see my cunt? Isn’t it plain, the treatment it desperately 
needs?” 

“Stay,” said the Superior, ‘be not overhasty. This is an 
initiatory ceremony: I am admitting Juliette into our college, and 
she must undergo the prescribed ritual.” 

“Who? Juliette?” said Flavie. “Why, I hadn’t noticed— 
Juliette? I don’t believe I’ve met this pretty thing before,” she 
murmured, approaching me. “Have you any skill at frigging, my 
princess?” she inquired, bestowing a kiss upon my lips. “Are you 
libertine ? Somewhat of a tribade, like the rest of us?” 

And without further ado, the scoundrel laid hands simulta- 
neously upon my breasts and my cunt. 

“Let her be,” said Volmar, who, baring my behind, was in- 
specting my buttocks; ‘‘let her be, she must first be initiated before 
we put her to use.” 

“Well, Delbéne,” spoke up Elizabeth, ‘“‘will you look at that 
Volmar kissing Juliette’s ass! She takes her for a little boy, the 
slut’s bent on buggering her.” (The reader will be pleased to take 
note that these comments proceeded from the most youthful mem- 
ber of the group.) 

“You know very well,” Sainte-Elme rejoined, ‘that Volmar’s 
an arrant male: she’s outfitted with a clitoris three inches long and, 
destined to insult Nature whichever be the sex she adopts, the 


24 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


whore’s got either to play the nymphomaniac or the sodomite: 
with her, there’s no median alternative.” 

Then, herself drawing near and exploring me from every angle 
while Flavie maintained her inquisitive regard upon my front, and 
Volmar hers upon my hindquarters: 

“No doubt of it,’’ she went on, “the sweet little bitch is 
trimly made, and I swear to you all that before the day’s over I'll 
know the taste of her fuck.” 

“Tf you please, ladies, if you please,” protested Delbéne, seek- 
ing to re-establish order, “‘one moment, I beg of you—” 

“Well, bleeding Jesus, be quick!’’ Sainte-Elme gasped, “I’m 
ready to run! What’s the delay? Or do we have to say our 
prayers before we frig; our cunts? Off with your clothes, sweet 
friends—” 

And, had you been there, the next instant you’d have seen six 
young damsels, each more lovely than the day, fall to admiring 
one another . . . to caressing one another’s naked bodies, and to 
composing the most varied and diverting groups. 

“Very well,” Delbéne resumed in an overseer’s tone, “I expect 
I'll obtain a little obedience from you. Listen to me: Juliette is 
going to stretch out upon the couch, and you shall each in your 
turn savor with her the pleasure of your individual choosing. I, 
stationed directly opposite the scene, I shall take you one after the 
other as you’ve had done with her, and the lewd activities begun 
with Juliette will be brought to a conclusion with me. But I'll be 
in no hurry, my fuck won't flow before I’ve had the five of you in 
my embrace.” 

The extreme respect in which the Superior’s commands were 
held made for the cornpletest punctuality in their execution. All 
these creatures being libertine to the core, you shall perhaps not 
be unwilling to hear what each of them required of me. As they 
stepped up by order of age, Elizabeth was the first to present 
herself. The fair little wench scrutinized every part of me and 
after having covered me with kisses she slipped in between my 
thighs, rubbed against me, and we both swooned away together. 
Flavie came next: her operations bespoke a greater science. After 
a thousand delicious preliminaries, we lay down so that each of us 
faced the other’s cunt and, with probing, twitching tongues, we 


Juliette 25 


fetched forth torrents of whey. Sainte-Elme approaches, she lies 
down upon the bed, has me sit astride her face, and while her nose 
prods spiritedly at my asshole, her tongue stabs into my cunt. Bent 
low over her, I am able to tease and tongue her in like fashion: my 
fingers tickle her ass, and five ejaculations in rapid succession con- 
vince me that the need she alluded to earlier was roundly authentic. 
I squirted myself dry into her mouth; and never before had I 
been so expertly sucked. Volmar will have nought but my buttocks, 
she devours them with kisses and, preparing the narrow passage 
with her sharp pink tongue, the libertine glues herself upon me, 
buries her generous clitoris in my anus, shakes and rattles away 
for a space, turns my head, ardently kisses my mouth, sucks my 
tongue, and frigs while embuggering me. The hussy isn’t content 
with that, weaponing me with a dildo she herself straps around 
my flanks, she wheels to receive my thrusts, and, aiming them at 
her button, the whore gets herself skewered bumwise; I frigged 
her the while, and she thought herself like to die of pleasure. 

After this last incursion, I went to take the post awaiting me 
upon Delbéne’s body. Here is how that fury arranged the company. 

Elizabeth, on her back, was placed at the edge of the couch. 
Delbéne, reclining in her arms, was having Elizabeth frig her 
clitoris. Flavie, kneeling upon the floor and her head level with the 
Superior’s cunt, was tonguing it and squeezing her thighs. Above 
Elizabeth, Sainte-Elme, her ass pressed flush to the latter’s visage, 
presented a yawning cunt to the kisses of Delbéne whom Volmar 
busily embuggered with her burning clitoris. Only I was needed to 
complete the tableau. Requested to take a crouching position next 
to Sainte-Elme, I offered for licking the reverse side of what 
Sainte-Elme was having tongued from in front. Delbéne passed 
in fickle and rapid style from Sainte-Elme’s cunt to my asshole, 
licked, reamed, pumped with surpassing ardor first the one, then 
the other, and writhing with the most unbelievable agility beneath 
Elizabeth’s fingers, beneath Flavie’s tongue, and before Volmar’s 
clitoris, the tribade every minute exploded a gush of fuck. 

“By the Almighty!” Delbéne panted, extricating herself from 
that melee, and flushed as red as a bacchante, “‘by bleeding Jesus, 
how I’ve discharged! Never mind, let’s carry on with the game: 
each of you is now to take her place on the couch, Juliette will dally 


26 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


with you in whatever way she prefers, you'll have to cede to her 
demands. But as she is still new at the sport, I propose to act as 
her mentor: the group will then form around her as it did around 
me, and we'll make her fuck fly till she begs for quarter.” 

Elizabeth is the first to be offered to my libertinage. 

“Place her,” says Delbéne, ‘in such a way she can kiss your 
dear little mouth while frigging you, and so that you'll receive a 
general stimulation. I'll take care of your asshole throughout the 
episode. Flavie dear, will you take Elizabeth’s place. I recommend 
this exquisite creature’s bubs to you,” the Abbess adds, ‘‘suck them 
while she tickles you: in view of Volmar’s tastes, you’d best run 
your tongue into her arius while, bending over you, she gives you 
the benefit of what her mouth can do. ... As for Sainte-Elme,” the 
Superior pursues, “‘yes, I think the following arrangement will 
suffice: I'll adjust myself so as to be able to suck both her ass and 
cunt while she renders you those same services. And finally, as for 
myself—speak, my beloved, I am here to do your bidding.” 

Warmed by the sight of what had been done for Volmar: 
“I'd love to embugger you,” said I, “with this instrument.” 

“Then do so, my darling, do whatever your heart desires,” 
was Delbéne’s humble reply; she presented her buttocks. ‘“There,” 
said she, “mark it well. And spare it not.” 

“Willingly!” I cried, sodomizing my instructress. “Since,” I 
said while engaged, “since the group is to form around me, let’s not 
tarry, My good Volmar,” I said, addressing the latter, “let your 
clitoris use my ass in the way and manner | am about to treat with 
Delbene’s : you’ve positively no idea how my temperament responds 
to this species of excitation. I'd like to frig Sainte-Elme with one 
hand and Elizabeth with the other; meanwhile, I'll give Flavie’s 
cunt a cleaning.” 

The Superior having issued instructions to ride me hard, I was 
not obliged to say another word; the situations were seven times 
varied, and seven times over my liberated fuck sprang in answer to 
divine cajolery. 

The pleasures of the table succeeded those of love: a superb 
repast was awaiting us. Divers kinds of wine and spirits put a 
bright hilarity in our heads, we returned to our libertine disporting. 
We divided into three couples. Sainte-Elme, Delbéne, and Volmar, 


Juliette <& 27 


the most advanced in years, each chose a fricatrice; by chance, or 
by predilection, Delbéne appointed me to be hers; Elizabeth fell to 
Sainte-Elme, Flavie to Volmar. The couples were so disposed that 
each could enjoy a view of the pleasures of the two others. Truly, 
the reader is little apt to imagine the least part of what we did. Oh, 
that Sainte-Elme, how delicious she was! Wildly enthusiastic over 
each other, our reciprocal friggery continued till we were both 
nigh to prostration. There was nothing we did not contrive, no 
fancy we failed to enact; then finally we all six knit again in a com- 
pact group, and the concluding two hours of this voluptuous riot 
were so lascivious that one may wonder whether so- many lewd 
goings-on are ever matched in any whorehouse. 

I was struck by, and must not fail to mention, this: the ex- 
treme solicitude shown for the pensionnaires’ maidenheads. To be 
sure, I did not observe the same concern manifested for those who 
had already taken vows; but I could not understand why they 
whose portion was not to be the cloister, but life in the world, were 
treated with such consideration. 

“Their honor resides therein,” Delbéne explained to me when 
I questioned her about the thing. “We do, by all means, wish to 
amuse ourselves with these girls; but why ruin them? Why cause 
them to detest the memory of the moments they passed in our 
midst ? No, we have that virtue, and however corrupt you suppose 
us to be, we never compromise our friends.” 

I found these measures and these ethics proper; but, created 
by Nature someday to attain an excellence in base villainy superior 
to anything I was to encounter, the desire to sully and peradventure 
to doom one of my companions rose up strong in my brain as of 
this same instant—this desire was at least as imperious as that 
other I had to be degraded myself. 

Delbéne shortly perceived that I preferred Sainte-Elme to her. 
Indeed, I did adore that charming girl; I simply could not leave 
her side; but as she had infinitely less wit than the Superior, another 
yearning, equally invincible, always brought me back to the latter. 

“Consumed as you appear to be by the passion to depucelate 
a maid, or to be depucelated yourself,” the incomparable Delbéne 
said to me one day, “I have no doubt but that Sainte-Elme has al- 
ready decided, or may easily be induced, to grant you these pleas- 


28 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ures. Need she hesitate? She runs no risk: she is going to pass the 
rest of her life in holy retirement. But you, Juliette, once bereft of 
your token, you'll be forever debarred from marriage. Think then, 
and believe me: untold misfortunes may well be the consequence of 
a flaw in the part you perhaps too lightly think of damaging. How- 
ever, heed me, my angel. you know that I adore you, give up that 
Sainte-Elme, take me instead and I'll satisfy all the pleasures you 
long for ina trice. You have only to select her in the whole convent 
whose first fruits you covet, and I myself shall make away with 
yours. ... There'll be some material injuries, needless to say. But 
fear not, I'll arrange everything. Just how ’tis managed is a great 
secret; if you would have it revealed to you, I must first have your 
most solemn oath that, as of this moment, you’ll speak not another 
word to Sainte-Elme. And if you break faith with me there will be 
no limit to my vengeance.” 

Far too fond of this bewitching creature to wish to compromise 
her and, in addition, burning to taste the pleasures Delbene en- 
couraged me to hope for if I abandoned Sainte-Elme, I promised 
everything. 

‘“°Tis well,” said Delbéne a month later, during which inter- 
val she had put me to the test, “‘have you made your choice? Who 
is it to be?” 

And now, my kind friends, never in your life will you guess 
upon what object my libertine imagination had alighted. Upon 
that girl, that same one. who stands there before your eyes: my 
own sister. But Madame Delbene knew her too well not to attempt 
to dissuade me from undertaking the thing. 

‘Have your own way,” said I at last. ““My second choice is 
Laurette.” 

Her youth (she was indeed a child of only ten) ... her pretty 
little wide-awake face, her liveliness, her high birth, everything 
about her incensed me . . . inflamed me; and seeing no im- 
portant obstacle to success—for this young orphan had no protector 
apart from an elderly uncle living at a hundred leagues’ distance 
from Paris—the Superior assured me I could consider as already 
sacrificed the victim my perfidious desires were immolating in 
advance. 

We appointed a day; on the eve of the drama Delbéne 


Juliette ed 29 


summoned me to her cell to spend the night in her embraces. Our 
conversation returned to questions of religion. 

“I fear,” said she, “lest you proceed in too great haste, my 
child. Your heart, beguiled by your mind, has not yet reached the 
stage at which I would prefer to see it. These superstitious infamies 
are still harassing you—I wager 'tis so. Listen to me, Juliette, lend 
me your undivided attention and make an effort so that in the 
future, with an effrontery equal to mine and without any qualms 
whatever, you will be able to carry your libertinage, anchored upon 
a substructure of reliable principles, to it matters not what extreme. 

‘“‘When they begin to chatter about religion, the first of the 
dogmas they trundle forth is the one pertaining to the existence 
of God: as it is the foundation of the whole edifice, I ought logi- 
cally to begin my examination by focusing upon it. 

“Oh, Juliette! let us have no doubt, this fantasy about there 
being a God has its origins in nothing but the mind’s limitations. 
Knowing not to whom or what all the universe about us is to be 
attributed, helpless before the utter impossibility of explaining the 
inscrutable mysteries of Nature, above her we have gratuitously 
installed a Being invested with the power of producing all the 
effects of whose causes we are profoundly ignorant. . 

“This abominable ghost was no sooner envisaged as the author 
of Nature than he had also to be deemed that of good and evil; 
the habit of regarding these opinions as true, and the obvious 
usefulness of suppositions which conveniently flatter laziness and 
curiosity, quickly made for the tendency most men still have of 
according the same degree of belief to a fable as to a geometrical 
proof, and the persnasion became so great, the habit so binding, 
that from the outset one had need of all one’s rational faculties to 
keep from tumbling into error. There is but a single easy step from 
the extravagance of acknowledging the existence of a God to the 
practice of worshiping him; nothing simpler than imploring the 
protection of what one dreads; nothing but what is most natural 
in the procedure which leads to burning incense upon the altars of 
the magical individual they posit as simultaneously the prime 
mover and the dispenser of everything that is. He was thought 
wicked, because some very disagreeable effects resulted from the 
necessary workings of Nature’s laws; to appease him, victims were 


30 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


needed: whence fastings, macerations, penances, and every other 
sort of idiocy, the fruit of the fear of the many and the brazen 
imposture of the few. Or, if you prefer, the perennial, unaltering 
effects of man’s weakness, for you may be certain that wherever you 
find human frailty you also come upon gods whelped by the same 
men’s terror, and homages rendered unto these gods, the inevitable 
result of the folly that erects them. 

“There is no question of it, my dear friend: this opinion 
which holds that a God exists and that he is the omnipotent force 
responsible for plenty and dearth is at the base of all the world’s 
religions. But which of these multifarious traditions is one to 
prefer? Each claims revelations which argue in its favor, each 
makes mention of texts, sacred books inspired by its divinity, each 
aims at nothing short of eclipsing all the others. Here I find I have 
a difficult choice to make. For guide in the night I have none but 
my reason, and directly I bring up its light to help me in the task 
of examining all these competing aspirants to my belief, all these 
fables, I see no more than a heap of farfetched incongruities and 
platitudes which chill and repulse me. 

“After devoting a rapid glance to the absurd ideas enter- 
tained upon this subject by all the peoples of the earth, I finally 
arrive at the doctrines espoused by the Jews and Christians. The 
former speak to me of a God, but they refuse me any account of 
his origins, they give me no idea, no definite image of him, and 
with what regards the nature of this people’s overlord, I obtain 
nothing but puerile allegories, unworthy of the majesty of a Being 
whom I am invited to accept as the Creator of the All; ’tis only in 
offensive contradictions this nation’s lawgiver talks to me of his 
God, and the terms and colors he uses to describe him are much 
apter to make me abhor than to get me to serve him. Seeing that it 
is this God himself who speaks in the Books they allude to in their 
struggle to explain him, I ask myself how, in providing concepts 
and images of himself, a God could possibly have chosen those 
which can only excite a man to despise him. Puzzled by this ques- 
tion, I decide to consult: these Books with greater care; and what 
am I to think when I cannot avoid remarking, as I inspect them, 
that not only could thev never have been dictated by the mind or 
spirit of a God, but that forsooth they were written down long 


Juliette 31 


after the death of the personage who dares affirm he transmitted 
verbatim God’s own phrases. Ha! so that’s the nonsense they’re 
peddling, I exclaim upon completing my investigations; these Holy 
Books they wish to fob off on me as performances composed by 
the Almighty are no more than the confections of some knavish 
charlatans, and instead of discerning traces of the deific, I behold 
nothing but the issue of stupid credulity and lame sleight. And 
indeed! what more abject ineptitude is there than this of every- 
where depicting, in these Books, a people chosen of the Lord it 
has just fabricated for itself, of announcing far and wide to all 
the world’s nations that it is to none but these squatters in a 
desert the Almighty speaks; that it was only in their fate he took 
any interest; that it is for their sake only he tampers with the 
motions of the stars, splits the seas, showers down manna from 
the skies; as if it would not have been far easier for this God to 
penetrate into their hearts, enlighten their minds, than to disturb 
the smooth operations of Nature, and as if this bent in favor 
of an obscure, insignificant, impoverished, unknown people were 
commensurate with the supreme majesty of the Being to whom 
you would have me ascribe the faculty of universal creation. But 
however compelling might be my urge to assent to what these 
preposterous Books seek to foist upon their reader, what choice 
have I but to demand whether the unanimous silence of all the 
adjoining countries’ historians, who ought surely to have taken 
note of the extraordinary events that crowd Scripture, must not. 
suffice to make me doubt the authenticity of the marvels reported 
in these romances? What, pray tell, am I to think when it is 
precisely amongst the ranks of that very race which so exuberantly 
celebrates its God to me that I discover the greatest quantity of 
unbelievers? What! this God overwhelms his people with blessings 
and miracles, and this cherished people believes not in its God? 
What! this God, to the tune of the most impressive theatrics, 
upon the peak of a mountain thunders forth his ordinations, upon 
this mountaintop dictates his sublime laws to the legislator of that 
people who, in the plain below, doubt him; and upon that plain 
idols are raised, monuments of cynicism, as though the lawgiving 
God booming on high deserved nothing better than to have his 
nose tweaked? At last he dies, this exceptional man who has just 


32 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


offered the Jews such a magnificent God, yes, he expires, a prodigy 
coincides with his death: by this abundance of unparalleled oc- 
currences the majesty of this God is doubtless to be stamped 
eternally in the memory of the race which has been witness to his 
greatness—a greatness the scions of those who watched the 
spectacle are later to prove reluctant to acknowledge. But less 
gullible than their forebears, in a few years idolatry uptilts the 
precariously seated altars of the God of Moses, and the unhappy, 
oppressed Jews remember their ancestors’ chimera only once 
they have regained their freedom. New leaders therewith begin 
to sing the old song, but, unfortunately, their prophesies are not 
borne out by developments: the Jews, these new leaders declare, 
shall prosper so long as they remain faithful to Moses’ deity: 
never did the Jews show him greater respect, and never did sor- 
row dog them more cruelly. Exposed to the wrath of Alexander’s 
successors, they escaped the Macedonian’s irons only to fall under 
the yoke of the Romans who, their patience exhausted at last by 
the revolt brewing perpetually among the Jews, demolished their 
temple and dispersed their numbers. And that then is how their 
God serves them! that is how this God, who loves them, who 
solely for their benefit rneddles with the sacred order of Nature, 
that is how he deals with them, that is how he fulfills his vows 
to them. 

“Ah no, it’s not then to be amongst the Jews I’ll go looking 
for a universal Almighty; finding in that hapless nation nothing 
better than some repulsive phantom, spawn of the uncurbed imag- 
inations of a handful of ambitious rogues, I must abhor the con- 
temptible God wickedness dreamt up. And now let’s have a glance 
at the Christians. 

‘“‘And what a host of further absurdities we have here! It’s 
no longer a mountain-climbing madman’s Tablets that rattle out 
the rules to me; this tirne the God in question proclaims himself 
through a much nobler envoy: Mary’s meeching bastard is entitled 
to a very different kind of respect than that claimed by the aban- 
doned son of Jochebed. So let’s peer closely at this sinister little 
cheat; what’s he up to, what does he contrive to demonstrate 
his God’s truth to me, what are his credentials, his methods? 
Capers and droll antics, suppers with sluts, fraudulent cures, puns, 


Juliette 2 33 


jests and duperies. ‘I am the Son of God,’ bleats this stammering 
little boor, incapable as he is of uttering one coherent phrase 
about his Father, of penning-a line to describe him; yes, ‘I am 
the Son of God,’ and better still: ‘I’m God,’ that’s what I’m to 
believe simply because the drivel emanates from him. The rascal’s 
hanged up there on a cross, does it matter? His followers desert 
him, it makes no difference at all: there he is, and no one else: 
God of the universe, nailed. Where did he take form? Why, in a 
Jewess’ womb. His birthplace? In a stable. How does he gain my 
belief in him? By abjectness, poverty, imposture, he has no other 
means to win me over. And if I waver, if I fail of belief ? Woe 
unto me! eternal tortures are my destiny. There’s a God, I’ve 
omitted nothing from the portrait and in it there’s not one feature 
that stirs the soul or appeals to the heart. Oh, matchless con- 
tradiction! ’tis upon the ancient law the new one is grounded, and 
nevertheless the new supersedes, sets at nought the old: what then 
is the basis of the new? This Christ, is he the lawgiver we're to 
hearken to? All by himself, he alone is going to give me an under- 
standing of the God who’s dispatched him here; but if it was to 
Moses’ interest to preach to me about the God whence his power 
derived, think of how eager must be the Nazarene to tell me about 
the God from whom he descends! Surely, the more modern law- 
giver must be better informed than the earlier one; Moses was 
at best able to chat familiarly with his master, but Christ is God’s 
blood offspring. Moses, content to ascribe natural causes to 
miracles, convinces his people that lightning blazes forth for the 
chosen only; the cleverer Jesus accomplishes the miracle himself; 
and if both do indeed merit their contemporaries’ profound scorn, 
it has nevertheless to be admitted that the later of the two was, 
through his superior insolence, the more justified in claiming the 
esteem of men; and the posterity that judges them by assigning a 
ghetto to the Jews shall definitely be obliged to grant the other 
a priority on the gallows. 

“So, Juliette, it is apparent, is it not, the vicious circle into 
which men fall as soon as they begin to rave about this rubbish: 
religion proves its prophet, the prophet his religion. 

‘This God so far not having shown hide nor hair of himself 
either to the Jewish sect or to that of the otherwise but hardly 


34 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


less contemptible Christians, I persevere in my quest for some 
solid evidence of him, I summon reason to my aid, and lest it 
deceive me I subject reason itself to analysis. What is reason? 
The faculty given me by Nature whereby I may dispose myself in 
a favorable sense toward such-and-such an object and against some 
other, depending upon the amount of pleasure or pain I derive 
from these objects: a calculation governed absolutely by my senses, 
since it is exclusively through them that I receive the comparative 
impressions which constitute either the pains I wish to avoid or the 
pleasures I must seek. 

“Thus, as Fréret says, the reason is nothing other than the 
scales we weigh objects in, and, balancing those of these objects 
that are external to ourselves, the reasoning mechanism tells us 
what conclusions we are to come to: when the scales tip beneath 
what looks to be the greatest pleasure, it is to that side our judg- 
ment always inclines. As you observe, this rational choice, in us 
as in animals which are also full of reason, is but the effect of the 
grossest and most material mechanical operation. But as reason 
is the only touchstone we possess, it must be the test whereunto 
we submit the faith knaves imperiously insist that we exhibit for 
objects which either lack reality or are so prodigiously vile in them- 
selves that they can only aspire to our loathing. Well now, Juliette, 
the very first thing this rational faculty essays is, as you sense, to 
assign an essential difference that distinguishes the thing which 
presents its appearance to the perceiver from the thing which the 
perceiver perceives. The representational perceptions of a given 
object are of still anott.er species. When they show us objects as 
absent now and as havirig been at some time in the past present to 
our minds, that is what we call memory, remembrance, recollection. 
If these perceptions propose objects to us, but do not advise us 
of their real absence, that is what we call imagination, and this 
imagination is the true cause of all our errors. Now, the most 
abundant source of these errors lies in our ascribing an independent 
existence to the objects of these inner perceptions and, more, in 
our supposing that they exist outside of ourselves and separately 
just as we conceive of them as separate from one another. To 
make myself clear to you, upon this separate idea, upon this idea 
born of the object which makes its appearance before the perceiver, 


Juliette 35 


I'll bestow the term objective idea in order to distinguish it from 
the impression the object generates in the perceiver, which I shall 
call the real idea. It is of utmost importance that these two varieties 
of existence not be confused; merely neglect to characterize these 
distinctions, and the way is open to boundless error. The infinitely 
divisible point, so necessary to geometry, belongs to the class of 
objective existences; solid bodies to that of real existences. How- 
ever abstract this may seem to you, my dear, you must make an 
effort to keep apace with me if you wish to follow my lead to 
the goal I wish my reasonings to bring us both to. 

“Before going farther, let us here observe that nothing is 
commoner than to make the grave mistake of identifying the real 
existence of bodies that are external to us with the objective 
existence of the perceptions that are inside our minds. Our very 
perceptions themselves are distinct from ourselves, and are also 
distinct from one another, if it be upon present objects they bear 
and upon their relations and the relations of these relations. They 
are thoughts when it is of absent things they afford us images; 
when they afford us images of objects which are within us, they 
are ideas. However, all these things are but our being’s modalities 
and ways of existing; and all these things are no more distinct 
from one another, or from ourselves, than the extension, mass, 
shape, ,color, and motion of a body are from that body. Sub- 
sequently, they necessarily bestirred themselves to invent terms 
to cover in general all particular but similar ideas: cause was the 
name given to all beings that bring about some change in another 
being distinct from themselves, and effect the word for any change 
wrought by whatever cause in whatever being. As this terminology 
gives rise in us, at best, to a very muddled idea of being, of action, 
of reaction, of change, the habit of employing it in time led people 
to believe they had clear-cut and precise perceptions of these things, 
and they finally reached the stage of fancying there could exist a 
cause which was not a being nor a body either, a cause which was 
really distinct from all embodiment and which, without movement, 
without action, could produce every imaginable effect. They were 
little concerned to ponder and realize that all beings continually 
acting and reacting upon one another produce and simultaneously 
undergo changes; the infinite progression of beings which have 


36 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


been successively cause and effect soon wearied the minds of those 
who at any cost were driven to find a cause in every effect. Sensing 
their imaginations worn to defeat by this long sequence of ideas, 
they hit upon the short cut of skipping in a single great leap back 
to a primary cause; they fancied it the universal cause in regard 
to which all particular causes are effects and which, itself, is the 
effect of no cause at all. 

“Behold it, Juliette : such is the God men have got themselves; 
behold what their enervated imaginations have spawned by way 
of a grotesque fantasy. Linking one sophism to the next, men 
wound up creating this, ’tis plain to see how they did it; and in 
keeping with the definition I gave you just a while ago, you recog- 
nize that this grandiose phantom, having a merely objective exist- 
ence, cannot exist anywhere outside the minds of the deluded who 
rivet their hallucinated attentions upon it, and hence it amounts to 
no more than the pure and simple effect of their brains’ heated 
disorder. Ah yes, behcld him nonetheless: the God of mortals, 
gaze well upon the abomination they’ve invented and in whose 
temples they have shed whole seas of blood. 

“If,” Madame Delbene continued, “I have dilated upon the 
essential differences between real and objective existences, that is, 
as, my dear, you understand, because I felt it a matter of urgency 
that I demonstrate to y..u the varieties subsisting in men’s practical 
and speculative opinior.s, and that I have you see that men are 
wont to ascribe a real existence to a good many things which 
actually have a no more than conjectural existence. Well, it is to a 
product of this conjectural existence mankind has given the name 
of God. If faulty reasoning were the only result of these exercises, 
we could dismiss the whole harmless affair; but, unfortunately 
the thing does not stop there: the imagination catches fire, the 
habit develops, and one becomes accustomed to considering as 
something real that which is but the fictive creature of our weak- 
ness. One is no sooner convinced that this chimerical being’s will 
is the cause of all that befalls us than one sets to employing every 
means to coddling and cockering him, every possible fashion to 
imploring him. 

“Let’s be guided by mature reflection and, deciding upon the 
adoption of a God ory after careful sifting of what has just 


Juliette & 37 


been advanced, let’s be persuaded that the whole notion of God 
being unable to occur to us save in an objective manner, nothing 
but illusions and phantoms can result from it. 

‘“‘Whatever they may serve up of sophistries, those absurd 
partisans of man’s deific bogey actually never say anything more 
than that there can be no effect without a cause. But they’re not 
prone to insist that if it be causes we're to discuss, we must trace 
them back to a first and eternal cause, a universal cause behind all 
particular and subsequent causes, an original, creative, and self- 
creating cause, a cause which is independent of any other cause. 
Admittedly, we do not truly understand the connection, the se- 
quence, and the progression of all causes; but ignorance of one fact 
is never adequate grounds for establishing and then accrediting 
another fact. They who want to convince us of their abominable 
God’s existence have the sauciness to tell us that, because we cannot 
designate the veritable source of the cause-and-effect series, we 
must necessarily acknowledge the universal cause they champion. 
Can you cite me a better example of iname argument? As if it were 
not preferable to admit ignorance instead of acquiescing in an 
absurdity; or as if the acceptance of this absurdity became proof 
of its existence! Idiots may as well sink in their mental limitations; 
the intelligent run the risk of foundering upon the rocks when it 
is into the phantom’s haven they undertake to steer. 

“But, with a cool head, let’s proceed and, if you like, mo- 
mentarily grant our antagonists the existence of the vampire’ that 
is the author of their felicity. Within this hypothesis, I ask them 
whether the law, the rule, the will whereby God supervises beings 
is of the same nature as our mortal will and power, whether in 
the same circumstances God can want and not want, whether the 
same thing can please and displease him, whether his sentiments 
are unchanging, whether the scheme by which he operates is im- 
mutable. If he is subject to a law, his function is merely executive; 
if this be so, he follows instructions and is not autonomous, has no 
power of his own. The unaltering law behind his gestures, what 
then is it? is it distinct from him, or inherent in him? If, on the 


1The vampire drank the blood from corpses, God causes that of men to be

other hand, this superior being can change his sentiments and 
his will, I wish to know why he does so. Certainly, he must have 
some motive for changing them, a much more logical motive than 
any that impels us, for God to outstrip us in wisdom as he surpasses 
us in prudence; well, can we possibly imagine this motive without 
lessening the perfection of the being who cedes to it? I’ll go 
farther: if God knows beforehand that he shall change his mind 
and will, why, since the Omnipotent can do anything, has he not 
arranged circumstances in such sort as to obviate the need for 
this mutation, always tiresome and proof always of weakness? 
And if he doesn’t know what’s coming next, what kind of omni- 
scient God is it who cannot foresee what he’s going to have to do? 
If he does have forekriowledge thereof—as, if one is to arrive 
at any notion of him at all, one must suppose—it is then fixed and 
decreed, apart from his will, that he shall act in this manner or 
in that: well, what law determines his will? where is that law? 
whence does it draw its force? 

“Tf your God is not free, if he is compelled to act in obedience 
to laws that govern him, then he amounts to something like destiny 
or chance which vows don’t touch nor prayers melt nor offerings 
appease and which you'd better contemn forever than beseech 
with such little success. 

“But if yet more dangerous, more wicked, more ferocious, 
your execrable God hid from man what was becoming necessary to 
man’s happiness, his aim was then not to make man happy, he 
thus loves him not, thus he is neither just nor benevolent. It should 
seem to me that a God ought not to will anything impossible, and 
it is not possible that man respect laws that tyrannize or are un- 
known or unknowable to him. 

“And there is yet more to it: this scurvy God hates man for 
being ignorant of what he has not been taught; he punishes man 
for having violated an unknown law, for pursuing bents and tastes 
man cannot have acquired from anyone but his creator. Oh, 
Juliette!” my tutor exclaimed, “can I conceive of this infernal and 
detestable God otherwise than as a despot, a barbarian, a monster 
to whom I owe all the hatred, all the wrath, all the scorn my 
quickened physical and moral faculties can excite in me? 

“And so even were they to bring off their demonstration, 


Juliette % 39 


even were they to present me with proof of God’s existence; were 
they to-succeed in convincing me that he has dictated the laws, 
singled out certain ‘individuals to attest them to mortals; were I 
to be made to see that in man’s relationship to God there is none 
but the purest consistency and harmony; even so nothing could 
prove to me that I please him by observing his commandments, for 
if he is not good he can deceive me, and my reason, which comes 
to me only from him, shall not be my guarantee, for it would not 
be unthinkable that he endowed me with rational powers simply in 
order that, using a treacherous instrument, I thrust myself all the 
deeper into error. 

“To continue. I now ask you deists how this God, whose 
existence I’ve no objection to allowing for the sake of a brief 
discussion, is going to behave in regard to those who are altogether 
unacquainted with his laws. If God punishes the invincible ignorance 
of those to whom his laws have not been promulgated nor an- 
nounced, he is unjust; and if he is incapable of instructing them, 
he is impotent. 

‘‘There is no doubt: the revelation of the Eternal’s laws must 
bear the hallmark of the God whence they emanate. Well, we have 
been regaled with revelations in quantity; which amongst them 
is stamped with an equally evident and indispensable seal of 
authenticity ? Thus it is by religion itself that the religion-announc- 
ing God is repudiated and destroyed; and what, I wonder, is to 
become of this religion when the God it established no longer exists 
save in the unhinged minds of fools? 

“‘Whether or not human knowledge be real or illusory, true 
or false, it matters little to the happiness of life; but that does 
not hold in what pertains to religion. Once men have as it were 
got their teeth into the imaginary objects religion proposes, they 
develop passionate enthusiasms for these objects: they come to 
believe that these ghosts flitting about in their heads really do 
exist, and from there on there’s no checking them. Every day, fresh 
occasion to tremble and more adepts quaking: such are the sole 
effects the perilous idea of God produces in us. This idea alone 
is responsible for the most withering and appalling ills in the life 
of man; ’tis this idea that constrains him to deprive himself of 
life’s most delectable pleasures, terrified as he is at all times lest he

displease this disgusting fruit of his delirious imagination. You, 
my good little friend, you must therefore and as soon as you can 
deliver yourself from the frights this goblin inspires; and to achieve 
your liberty you without doubt have but to lift a steady fist to smash 
the idol into small bits. 

“The concept of a divinity the priests wish to foist upon us 
is the concept, precisely, of a universal cause whereof every other 
cause is an effect. The imbeciles to whom these impostors have 
always addressed themselves believed that such a cause did exist— 
could possibly exist separately from the particular effects it pro- 
duces, quite as if the modalities of a body could be separated from 
that body, as if whiteness being one of the qualities of snow, it 
were possible to peel that quality away from snow. Do modifications 
take leave of the bodies they modify? Well then, your God is 
only a modification of the matter that by its essence is perpetually 
in motion; this motion which you think you can separate from it, 
this energy native to matter, there’s’ your God; and now, you 
flea-brained worshiping mice, now inspect this august being who 
made you in his image, and decide for yourselves to what homage 
he is entitled! 

“Those wits that hold the first cause capable of producing no 
more than the local movement of bodies, and who reserve to our 
human intelligence the power of self-determination, curiously limit 
that cause and, stealing away its universality, reduce it to the lowest 
thing in Nature, to, that is, the mean task of keeping matter on 
the move. But as all things in Nature are interrelated, let mental 
feelings produce movements in living bodies, let the movements of 
bodies excite sentiments in souls, all very well, but one cannot 
resort to this supposition to found or defend religious worship; 
as a consequence of the perception of the objects that are there 
before our consideration, we ask only that these perceptions occur 
when we are prepared to make the most of them, when they coincide 
with a stirring in our organs. Thus the cause of these stirrings is 
the cause of our will and desiring. If this cause knows nothing of 
the effect these stirrings produce in us, then what a puny God you've 
got there! and if he knows, then he is accomplice to it and consents 
thereto; if, knowing, he does not consent, he is thus forced to do 
what he does not want tc do; there is thus something more power- 


Juliette 41 


ful than he, hence he is constrained to obey laws. As our will always 
expresses itself in some movement, gesture, or impulse, God is 
consequently obliged to concur in what we will and sanction what 
at our will’s behest we do: God hence dwells in the parricide’s 
murdering arm, in the incendiary’s torch, in the whore’s cunt. God 
begins to sweat, to say no? Then there’s a skimpy, starveling little 
God, weaker than us, and he’s forced to obey us. And so, irrespec- 
tive of what they say, it’s got to be stated that there is no universal 
cause; or if you simply cannot manage without one, we'll have to 
let it consent to everything that happens to us, we'll have to suppose 
it never wills anything else, you'll have also to accept that this 
shoddy Omnipotence can neither hate nor love any of the particular 
beings which emanate from it, because all of them obey it equally, 
and that, this being so, words like punishments, rewards, command- 
ments, prohibitions, order, and disorder are merely allegorical 
terms drawn from what transpires in the sphere of human events 
and intercourse. 

‘Notice now that as soon as one no longer feels strictly bound 
to regard God as an essentially good being, as a being who loves 
mankind, it is very possible to think that God intended to deceive 
man. Thus even were we to grant the authenticity of all the 
miracles upon which the whole scheme is made to repose by those 
who claim to knowledge of the laws he disclosed to a few indi- 
viduals, as all these prodigious deeds confirm the injustice and 
inhumanity of God, we have no assurance that these wonders were 
not wrought with the express purpose of gulling us, and nothing 
authorizes the belief that by the most scrupulous observance of 
his commandments we can ever win his friendship. If he does not 
punish those who have observed his decreed law, its observance 
becomes useless; and as this obedience is painful, your God, in 
prescribing it, showed himself guilty of both uselessness and wicked- 
ness: whereupon | must again inquire whether this being is worthy 
of our pious attentions. His commandments, moreover, are in no 
wise respectworthy; they are absurd, contrary to right reason, they 
are offensive to our moral sense and are physically afflicting, they 
who proclaim the law violate it night and day, and if indeed there 
is in the world a scattering of personages who seem moved to 
express faith in this law, let us carefully scrutinize their mentalities, 


42 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


we will discover them to be simple-minded or lunatic. I turn an 
analytical eye upon the evidence offered in proof of this scandalous 
jumble of mysteries and decrees, the issue of our ridiculous God, 
and I find everything 29erched upon the pitiable foundations of 
confused, uncertain traditions which seem only to invite regular 
defeat at the hands of any adversary, however unskilled he may be. 

““We may declare it truthfully and with confidence: of all the 
religions edified by mankind, there is not one which can make any 
legitimate claim to pre-eminence over the rest; not one which is 
not stuffed with fables, replete with lies, overflpwing with perver- 
sities, not one which is not studded with the most imminent dangers 
lying cheek to jowl with the most glaring contradictions. The crazed 
seek to justify their reveries, and they call miracles to their rescue: 
whence the result that, with the same tedious circular process, it’s 
now the miracle which proves the religion whereas a moment ago 
*twas the religion which proved the miracle. Nor is it that only 
one religion requires miracles; they all do, miracles are cited in 
every holy text, and on every page. Leda had a splendid swan; 
to compete with her, Mary had to be served by her dove. 

“Tf nevertheless all these miracles were true, the obvious and 
necessary result would te that God had allowed miracles to occur 
in behalf of true and false religions alike, in which case his impar- 
tiality would manifest his unconcern for error and truth. The 
entertaining thing is that every sect is as firmly persuaded as any 
of its rivals of the overwhelming reality of the prodigies it recog- 
nizes. If they are all false, one must conclude that entire nations 
have been capable of believing fictions; thus, insofar as the truth 
of prodigies goes, the unconditional credulity of a whole people 
proves nothing whatsoever. But not one of these alleged facts can 
be proved in any way other than by the persuasion of those who 
believe them already, hence there is not one the truth whereof has 
been adequately established; and as these wonders constitute the 
sole means by which we might be compelled to believe in a religion, 
we must conclude that not one stands proven, and we must deem 
them all as the handiwork of fanaticism, deceit, fraud, and ar- 
rogance.”’ 

“But,” I interjected at this point, “if there be neither God 
nor religion, what is it runs the universe ?” 


Juliette & 43 


“My dear,” Madame Delbéne replied, “the universe runs 
itself, and the eternal laws inherent in Nature suffice, without any 
first cause or prime mover, to produce all that is and all that we 
know; the perpetual movement of matter explains everything: 
why need we supply a motor to that which is ever in motion? The 
universe is an assemblage of unlike entities which act and react 
mutually and successively with and against each other; J discern 
no start, no finish, no fixed boundaries, this universe I see only 
as an incessant passing from one state into another, and within 
it only particular beings which forever change shape and form, 
but I acknowledge no universal cause behind and distinct from the 
universe and which gives it existence and which procures the modi- 
fications in the particular beings composing it. I affirm indeed that, 
in my view, the absolute contrary holds, and I believe I have proven 
my point. We need not fret if we find nothing to substitute for 
chimeras, and above all let us never accept as cause for what we 
do not comprehend something else we comprehend even less. 

“After having demonstrated the complete extravagance of 
the deific system,” that talented woman went on, “I’ll surely have 
little trouble uprooting the prejudices and superstitions that have 
been planted in you ever since the day when, at a tender age, you 
first heard theories expounded on the principle of life; is there 
really anything more extraordinary than this superiority to animals 
which humans arrogate to themselves? Ask them upon what basis . 
their superiority rests. ‘We have a soul’—that’s their silly response. 
Then ask them to explain. what they mean by this vocable, soul. 
And then you'll see them stutter, flounder amidst contradictions: 
‘It is an unknown substance,’ they begin; next: it’s a secret incor- 
poreal power; finally, a spirit whereof they have no definite idea. 
Ask them how this spirit, which, like their God, they imagine as 
totally without extension, has managed to wed itself to their 
material and extensive body, they'll tell you that they frankly 
don’t know, that it’s passing strange, a mystery, that God’s omnip- 
otent dexterity has brought this union about. Such are the ad- 
mirably keen and incisive ideas that stupidity forms of the hidden 
or rather imaginary substance which stupidity turns into the 
mechanism responsible for all of stupidity’s acts. 

“To that nonsense I have just this to reply: if the soul is a 


44 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


substance that differs essentially from the body and that can have 
no relation to it, their fusion is impossible. Furthermore, this soul, 
being in essence different from the body, ought necessarily to act 
in a different fashion from it; however, we observe that the impulses 
experienced by the body make themselves felt also upon this so- 
called soul, and that these two substances, dissimilar in essence, 
always act in concert. You'll tell me that this harmony is another 
mystery, and in my turn I'll tell you that I’m not aware of having 
any soul, that I’m acquainted with and feel nothing but my body; 
that it is the body which feels, which thinks, which judges, which 
suffers, which enjoys; and that all its faculties are the necessary 
effects of its mechanism, organization, and structure. 

“Although man is utterly incapable of achieving the faintest 
idea of this soul of his, although everything proves to man that he 
feels, thinks, acquires thoughts and ideas, takes pleasure and suffers 
pain only by means of the senses or the organs of the body, not- 
withstanding he carries on with his folly and comes to the point 
of believing that this soul about which he knows nothing is exempt 
from death. But even supposing this soul to exist, tell me, if you 
please, how one can avoid recognizing ‘its total dependence upon 
the body and the fact that it must share in all the vicissitudes of the 
body’s fate. And yet absurdity can bring a man so far as to believe 
that by its nature the soul has nothing in common with the body; 
one would have us thin« that it can act and feel without the body’s 
aid; in a word, one maintains that, deprived of this body and sun- 
dered from the senses, “his sublime soul will be able to live in order 
to suffer, experience great comfort or severe torments. It is upon 
some such loose heap of conjectural absurdities one builds the 
wonderful opinion relative to the soul’s immortality. 

“Tf I ask them their motives for supposing the soul deathless, 
they pipe up at once: ‘Because it is in man’s very nature to desire 
eternal life.’ ‘But,’ I reply, ‘does your desire become proof of its 
fulfillment? By what peculiar logic dare one decide that something 
cannot fail to happen because one wishes it to?’ ‘The impious,’ 
they give me back, ‘the impious, lacking the flattering hopes of an 
afterlife, desire definitive annihilation.’ ‘Well then, upon the basis 
of this desire, aré they any less authorized to conclude that they will 
be annihilated than you claim yourselves authorized to conclude that 


Juliette & 45 


you are going to go on existing always simply because that is your 
desire ?’ 

“Oh, Juliette!” this rigorous logician pursued with all the energy 
of a passionate conviction, ‘‘oh, my beloved friend, doubt thereof 
there may be none: when we die, we die. Inside and out, through 
and through; and once the Fates have severed the thread, the 
human frame is no more than an inert mass, unable to produce those 
movements which, collectively, constituted its life. In the dead 
body neither circulation nor respiration nor digestion nor locution 
nor intellection are any longer there; upon death, so they say, the 
soul quits the body; but to say that this soul, of which nothing is 
known, is the principle of life is to say nothing at all unless it be 
that an unknown force is the hidden principle of imperceptible 
motions. What is more natural and simpler than to believe a dead 
man is dead, over and done with; and what more ludicrous than 
to believe that when a man is dead he’s still alive ? 

“We smile at the naiveté of those peoples who have the 
custom of burying provisions and victuals alongside corpses; is it 
more farfetched to believe men will eat after death than to fancy 
they'll think, have pleasant or unpleasant ideas, amuse themselves, 
repent, feel hurt or joy, be glad or heavy of heart, when once the 
very organs required for transmitting and receiving sensations and 
ideas shall have rotted to bits and these bits crumbled to dust? 
To say that human souls will be happy or unhappy after death is 
tantamount to declaring that men can see without eyes, hear with- 
out ears, taste without palates, scent without noses, touch without 
fingers. And yet, think of it! they consider themselves exceedingly 
clever, most rational, those societies which uphold such notions. 

“The dogma of the soul’s immortality assumes the soul to be 
a simple substance, in short, a spirit, but I haven’t given up won- 
dering what a spirit is.” 

“T was taught,” I volunteered, “‘that a spirit is a substance 
lacking extension, incorruptible, and having nothing in common with 
matter.” 

‘That being the case,” my tutor answered at once, “tell me 
how your soul arranges to be born, to grow, to strengthen itself, 
to agitate itself, and to age, and all this concurrently with the evolu- 
tion of your body ? 


46 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Like a myriad of fools who have entertained the same no- 
tions, you'll say that the whole affair is downright mysterious; but, 
imbeciles that they are, .f all these problems are mysteries, they un- 
derstand nothing about them, and since they understand nothing 
about them, how can they make an affirmative decision about the 
coexistence of what they are incapable of conceiving? In order to 
believe or affirm sometiing, need you not at least know in what 
consists the thing you believe and declare to be? Belief in the soul’s 
immortality, that comes round to saying one is convinced of the 
existence of a thing whereof there is no possible means of forming 
any precise concept whatever; it’s belief in a batch of empty words 
without being able to associate any meaning to them; to maintain 
that a thing is such as it 's said to be, that’s the last stage in madness 
and vanity. 

‘Ah, but what odd logicians these theologians are! Whenever 
they cannot divine the natural causes of things, they jump straight 
into improvising superr.atural causes, they imagine spirits, gods, 
occult causes, unfathomable and uncanny agents, or rather words 
for all these, words a great deal more obscure than the phenomena 
they labor to account for. We'd best remain within the realm of 
Nature when we wish to appreciate the effects of Nature; let us 
never stray away from Nature when we wish to explain her phe- 
nomena, let us cease to worry over causes too subtle to be grasped 
by our organs, let us fully realize that it shall never be by turning 
our back upon Nature that we’ll find the solutions to the problems 
Nature poses us. 

“Within the terms of theological hypothesis itself—that is to 
say, supposing that matter is moved by an omnipotent motor—by 
what right do the theologians deny their God the power to give this 
matter the faculty of thought? Were we to suppose a matter that 
could think we could at least gain a few insights into the subject of 
thought or into what does the thinking in us; whereas so long as 
we attribute thought to an immaterial being it is impossible for us 
even to begin to understand it. 

“We encounter th: objection that materialism reduces the 
human being to a mere machine, that materialism is hence a dis- 
honor to our kind; but is it to honor this spectes to say that man 
acts at the behest of the secret impulses of a spirit or of a certain 


Juliette Q» 47 


I don’t know quite what which serves to animate him nobody 
knows quite how? 

‘One readily perceives that the superiority they accord spirit 
over matter, or the soul over the body, is based simply on our ig- 
norance of the nature of this soul, whereas everyone is more famil- 
iar with matter and flesh and fancies he understands them to the 
point of knowing precisely how they work. And yet, any contempla- 
tive mind must be aware that the simplest workings of our bodies 
are as difficult to apprehend as the enigmatic operations of thought. 

‘Why is it so many people have this inflated esteem for 
spiritual substance? I can offer only one explanation: their total 
inability to define it intelligibly. The slight case in which our 
theologians hold the flesh comes only from the fact that familiarity 
breeds contempt. When they tell us that the soul is of greater ex- 
cellence than the body, they tell us nothing unless it be that that 
with which they have no acquaintance must perforce be finer, nobler, 
than that whereupon they have a few vapid ideas. 

‘‘Tirelessly they fill our ears with the usefulness of this after- 
life dogma ; they declare that even if it were all a large fib, it would 
still have its advantages, for it would continue to alarm men and 
keep them browbeaten on the path of virtue. Well, I wonder 
whether it’s really so, that this dogma renders men better behaved 
and more virtuous. I dare say, tothe contrary, that it is effective 
only in rendering them insane, hypocritical, wicked, despondent, 
irritable, and that you'll always find more virtues and more civil 
conduct among those peoples who are not burdened with these ideas 
than among those with whom they are the foundation of religion. 
If they who are appointed to instruct and rule over men had wisdom 
and virtue themselves, realities, and not fantasies, would enable 
them to govern better; but scoundrels, quacksalvers, ambitious 
ruffians, or low sneaks, the lawgivers have ever found it easier to 
lull nations to sleep with bedtime tales than to teach truths to the 
public, than to develop intelligence in the population, than to en- 
courage men to virtue by making it worthwhile for sound and 
palpable reasons, than, in short, to govern them in a logical manner. 

“Let there be no doubt of it, priests have had their motives 
for contriving and fostering this ridiculous rumor of the soul’s 
immortality; lacking such devices, how would they have wrung 


48 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pennies from the dying ¢ Ah, if these loathsome dogmas of God and 
of a soul that outlives us are of no use to humankind, we must at 
least admit that they are indispensable to those who have taken 
upon themselves the chore of infecting public opinion.’ 

“But,” said I, “is not the dogma of the immortality of the 
soul comforting to the downtrodden and unlucky ? Illusion though 
it may be, is it not soothing, is it not gladdening? is it not a boon, 
that man may believe he will be able to survive himself and his 
woes and someday in heaven taste the bliss this world denied him?” 

“Frankly,” said she, “I fail to see that the desire to set a few 
ill-starred dolts at ease warrants poisoning the minds of millions of 
respectable people; and, besides, is it rational to trim the truth to 
fit one’s wishes? Be a little more courageous, abide by the general 
law, resign yourself to :he order of a fate which decrees that you, 
along with everybody else, shall sink back into the crucible of 
Nature, soon to emerge again in some other shape; for the fact 
is that nothing perishes in the womb of this mother of humankind. 
The elements composing us first decompose then straightway re- 
compose otherwise, in other combinations; an undying laurel grows 
upon Virgil’s grave. I ask you, foolish deists, whether this glorious 
transmigration is not as mild as your heaven-or-hell alternative? 
For if the thought of paradise cheers us, few there are who wax 
ecstatic over that of hell; and you Christian idiots, say you not 
that to be saved one reeds have grace your God grants to not 
many folk? Well, there you have some comforting thoughts! Who 
amongst you wouldn’t prefer to be annihilated once rather than 
burn forever ? Who then will dare maintain that the attitude which 
liberates one from these dreads is not a thousand times more 
humane than the uncertainty wherein we are left to languish by 
setting up a God who, proprietor of the favors he distributes, gives 
them only to a small clique of his cronies and who allows that all 
the others become wort.y of eternal torture? Enthusiasm or mad- 


2 How else would they ever survive? Only two categories of individuals are apt 
to find religious systems at all to their liking: firstly, that which these absurdities 
fatten; and secondly, that made up of imbeciles who unfailingly believe all they’re 
told and never examine anything critically. But I defy any thinking being, any man 
possessed of an ounce of wit, to maintain that he in good faith believes these religious 
atrocities. 


Juliette & 49 


ness alone can make one reject a lucid and reassuring system and 
cleave to one where improbable conjectures make one despair.” 

“But what shall become of me?’ I demanded of Madame 
Delbéne. ‘‘I am afraid of this darkness, this eternal annihilation 
scares me.” 

“And, pray tell, what were you before birth?” inquired that 
brilliant woman. “Several unqualified lumps of unorganized matter 
as yet without definite form or at least lacking any form you can 
hope to remember. Well, you’re going to turn back into those same 
or similar lumps of matter, you’re going to become the raw material 
out of which new beings will be fashioned, and this will happen 
when natural processes bring it about. Shall you find all this pleasur- 
able? No. Shall you suffer? No. Is there anything truly objection- 
able.here? No; and what is he who on earth agrees to sacrifice all 
his pleasures in exchange for the certitude of never having to 
undergo pain? What would he be, if he were able to strike this 
bargain? An inert, motionless. being. And after he dies, what will 
he be? Exactly the same thing. What then is the use of fretting, 
since the law of Nature positively condemns you to the same state 
you'd gladly accept if you were given the opportunity to choose? 
Eh, Juliette, have you existed since the beginning of time? No; and 
does that fact make you grieve and despair? Have you any better 
cause to despair at the fact that you’re not going to exist till the 
end of time? La la, calm yourself, my pigeon; the cessation of 
being affrights only the imagination that has created the execrable 
dogma of an afterlife. 

“The soul—or, if you wish, the active principle that animates, 
moves, determines us—is nothing other than matter subtilized to 
a certain degree, by the means of which refinement it acquires the 
faculties that so amaze us. Not any given portion of matter would 
be capable of the same effects, to be sure; but, through combination 
with the ordinary portions composing our body, these extraordinary 
ones attain their capacity rather as fire can become flame when 
combined with fatty or other combustible materials. In fine, the 
soul cannot be approached save in two senses: as active principle, 
and as thinking principle; well, whether viewed as the one or the 
other, we may prove its materiality by two irrefutable syllogisms. 
(1) As active principle it is divisible; for the heart, long after its 


50 > THE MARQUI3 DE SADE 


separation from the body, preserves its action, continuing to beat; 
now, whatever is susceptible of division is material. The soul, be- 
held as active principle, is divisible, hence material. (2) Whatever 
is susceptible of structural degeneration is material, that which is 
essentially spirit cannot deteriorate; well, the soul is affected by 
the condition of the tody, the soul is weak in youthful bodies, 
decrepit in superannuated frames; it thus undergoes corporeal 
influence; however, anything that degenerates structurally is mate- 
rial: the soul declines and hence it is material. , 

“Let us say forthrightly and repeatedly: there is nothing 
marvelous in the phenomenon of thought, or at least nothing 
which proves this phenomenon distinct from matter, nothing which 
indicates that matter, subtilized or modified in some or another 
manner, cannot produce thought; the which is infinitely easier to 
comprehend than the existence of God. If this sublime soul were 
indeed the work of God, why should it have to share in all the 
changes and accidents the body is subject to? It would seem to 
me that, as a divine artifact, this soul ought to be perfect, and 
perfection does not consist in undergoing modifications in order to 
keep pace with so defective a material entity as the human body. If 
this soul were a god’s production, it would not have to sense, 
reflect, or be the victim of the body’s gradations; were the soul a 
thing of divine perfection, it wouldn’t, it shouldn’t, be able to; 
rather, fully formed from the onset, it would conjoin itself to the 
embryo, and Cicero would have been able to pen his Tusculanae 
disputationes, Voltaire his Alzire, each in the cradle. If that is not 
so, and cannot be so, it is because the soul ripens step by step with 
the body’s development, then with it descends the farther slope; 
the soul therefore is constituent of parts, since it rises, sinks, 
augments, diminishes: well, whatever is composed of parts is ma- 
terial; hence the soul is material, since it is composed of parts. Am I 
clear? We have now to acknowledge the utter impossibility of the 
soul existing without the body, and the latter without the former. 

“Nor is there anything to marvel at in the absolute sovereignty 
the soul exerts over the body. Body and soul, they are one, a 
whole made up of equal parts, yes, but in which, howbeit, the 
cruder must be subordinate to the more refined part, this for the 
same reason that flame, which is material, subordinates the wax it 


Juliette 51 


consumes and which is also material: there, as in our bodies, you 
have the example of two materials in conflict, the subtler of the two 
dominating the cruder. 

“There, Juliette, I have, so I think, supplied you with more 
than is needed that you be convinced of the nullity of this God they 
say to exist and of this dogma which ascribes immortality to the 
soul. Oh, but they were shrewd beggars who invented this pair of 
conceptual monstrosities! And what have they been unwilling to 
stoop to, what have they not extorted from the people by calling 
themselves the ministers of God upon whose good or bad mood 
everything depends in the life after this! What has not been their 
influence upon the minds of simple folk who, in dread of agonies or 
rewards to come, were obliged to court these cheats, self-appointed 
and sole mediators between God and men, puissant quacks whose 
intervention, swaying the Lord, could arrange fates! All these 
fables thus are but the inspired fruit of self-seeking, of pride, and 
of the insanity of a handful of ambitious individuals nourished 
upon the ravings of a few others and fit for nothing but our con- 
tempt, fit only to be extinguished, that they may never again re- 
appear. Oh, my dearest Juliette, with what earnestness I exhort you 
to detest them as I do! Such systems as these, it is said, lead to the 
degradation of morals and manners. What’s this! are manners and 
morals then more important than religions? Depending absolutely 
upon the degree of latitude in which a country chances to be located, 
manners and morals are an arbitrary affair, and can be nothing else. 
Nature prohibits nothing ; but laws are dreamt up by men, and these 
petty regulations pretend to impose certain restraints upon people; 
it’s all a question of the air’s temperature, of the richness or poverty 
of the soil in the district, of the climate, of the sort of men in- 
volved, these are the unconstant factors that go into making your 
manners and morals. And these limitative laws, these curbs and 
injunctions, aren’t in any sense sacred, in any way legitimate from 
the viewpoint of philosophy, whose clairvoyance penetrates error, 
dissipates myth, and to the wise man leaves nothing standing but 
the fundamental inspirations of Nature. Well, nothing is more 
immoral than Nature; never has she burdened us with interdictions 
or restraints, manners and morals have never been promulgated by 
her. Oh, Juliette, you’re going to think me peremptory, somewhat 


52 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the rebel and an enemy of yokes and handcuffs; but with uncompro- 
mising severity I am going to dismiss this equally absurd and 
childish obligation which enjoins us not to do unto others that which 
unto us we would not have done. It is the precise contrary Nature 
recommends, since Nature’s single precept is to enjoy oneself, at the 
expense of no matter wiom. It may very possibly follow from the 
observance of this axiorn that our pleasures disturb the felicity of 
others; will those pleasures be the less:keen for that ? This so-called 
“Law of Nature” with which fools wish to manacle us is thus just 
as fantastical as man-made laws and, trampling them all indiscrimi- 
nately in the mud, we may be intimately persuaded that there is no 
wrong in doing anything: we may well please. But at our leisure we 
shall return to these subjects; for the nonce, I flatter myself in the 
belief that my discussion of morality has been as convincing as my 
reflections upon religion. Let’s now put our theories into practice 
and, after having demonstrated to you that you can do everything 
without committing a «rime, let’s commit a villainy or two to 
convince ourselves that everything can be done.” 

Electrified by these discourses, I fling myself into my friend’s 
arms; in a thousand little ways I show gratitude for the care she 
is lavishing upon my education. 

“IT owe you more than life itself, my beloved Delbéne,” I 
cried; ‘‘what is an existence without philosophy ? Is life worth living 
when one lies crushed beneath the yoke of lies and stupidity ? Come 
then,” I said with great warmth, “I feel worthy of you at last, ’tis 
upon your breast I take sacred oath never to return to the illusions 
which through gentle fr:endship you have just exterminated in me. 
Continue my instructior, continue to direct my footsteps toward 
happiness; I entrust myself to your guidance; do with me what you 
will, and be sure of this: that you have never had a disciple more 
ardent or more docile than Juliette.” 

Delbene was beside herself with delight; for a libertine intel- 
ligence, there is no more piercing pleasure than that of making 
proselytes. A thrill marks the inculcation of each principle, a multi- 
tude of various feelings are flattered by the sight of others becom- 
ing gangrened by the ve-y corruption that rots us. Ah, how it is to 
be cherished, that influence obtained over their souls, souls which 
are finally re-created by our counsels, urgings, and seductions. 


Juliette 2» 53 


Delbéne gave me back all the kisses I showered upon her; she said 
I was going to become a wayward girl like her, an undisciplined and 
very disrespectful little whore, that’s where I was headed, I’d wind 
up an atheist, and when God should begin to wonder what on earth 
had happened to good little Juliette, she, Delbéne, would most 
gladly step forth and accept the blame for having caused the loss 
of this soul. And her caresses becoming more vibrant, we soon 
ignited the passions’ fire by the bright-burning lamp of philosophy. 

“Stay,” said Delbeéne, “since you’re bent on being depucelated, 
I’m going to satisfy you straight off.” 

Crazed with lust, the wench instantly fits herself with a dil- 
do; she frigs me; this, says she, will make me overlook the pain she’s 
about to cause me and then she delivers a thunderous blow, then 
another, and ’tis this one does in my maidenhead. Words cannot 
describe what I suffered; but the lancing pains provoked by this 
terrible operation soon yielded to the sweetest pleasures. The in- 
defatigable Delbéne’s fury only increased; stuffing me with great 
cracking bucks and thwacks, her tongue meanwhile probed far into 
my mouth, and worrying my behind with her two clawing hands, 
she had me discharging one steady hour in her arms, and she only 
left off when I begged for truce. 

“Retaliate, retaliate,” she gasped, “I want to be remunerated 
in that specie,” said she. “I am devoured by lewd desires, fucking 
you was all work and no play, I’ve got to discharge too, Christ 
knows.” 

From a doted-upon mistress I immediately turned into the 
most passionate lover: I encunted Delbéne, I set the scraper going. 
God! what transports! No woman fish-lopped more amorously, 
never was there one carried so far away by pleasure’s throes; ten 
times in succession the slut swooned of ease, I thought her like 
to distill into fuck. 

“Oh, my soul’s delight!” I said to her, “‘is it not true that the 
greater an individual’s wit and instruction the better accoutered 
he is to taste the amenities of voluptuousness ?” 

“Unquestionably,” Delbéne replied, ‘and the eminently simple 
reason therefor is this: voluptuousness can tolerate no inhibitions, 
it attains its zenith only by shattering them all. Now, the stronger 
a person’s intellectual endowments, the more restraints he breaks,

and the more decisively: hence, the person of superior wit and 
parts will always be found more apt to libertinage’s pleasures.” 

“I believe that the exceeding delicacy of highly developed 
organs must also be reckoned as contributory,’ I went on. 

“Nor is that to be doubted either,’’ said Madame Delbéne; 
“the more highly polished the mirror, the better it receives and 
the better reflects the objects presented it.” 

Finally, both of us dry from extreme toil, I reminded my 
instructress of her promise to me to depucelate Laurette. 

“Tve not in the least forgotten it,” she answered, “the deed 
is for tonight. When everyone has retired to the dormitories, you’ll 
slip away, so shall Flavie and Volmar. Leave the rest to me; now 
you're initiated into our mysteries. Be bold, be firm, Juliette, be 
staunch; there are wonderful things I design to show you.” 

I took leave of my friend to put in an appearance at the 
house; but fancy my surprise when I heard it reported that a 
pensionnaire had just fled the abbey. I asked her name. It was 
Laurette. 

“Laurette!” I cried. Then, to myself: ‘““My God, she upon 
whom I was counting . . . she the thought of whom has hurled me 
into this state. ... Perfidious desires, have I then conceived them in 
vain?” 

I request the details, no one is able to provide them; I fly to 
inform Delbéne, her door is shut, I have no way of reaching her 
before the scheduled hour. Ah, how slowly the time drags away! 
I hear the bell toll at last; Volmar and Flavie arrived before me, 
they were already in Delbéne’s quarters.® 

“Alas,” I say, addressing myself to the Superior, ‘‘how. shall 
you keep your word to me? Laurette is gone, vanished. Who can 
replace her?” 

And then with a certain sourness: 

“Ah! ’tis plain I’m not to enjoy the pleasure you promised 
me—”’ 

“Juliette,” broke in Madame Delbéne, and her tone was cool, 
her look stern, “‘the foremost of amity’s laws is that of trust: if, 

3 May we refresh the reader’s memory, who may have forgot that the said 


Volmar is a charming nun of twenty-one years; and that Flavie is a pensionnaire 
aged sixteen and extremely fair of face and figure.

my dear, you wish to be one of us, you can do with more self- 
control and fewer suspicions. Is it likely—consider now—is it 
thinkable that I would have promised you a pleasure I lack the 
means to have you savor? Ought you not to think me sufficiently 
clever ... ought you not to believe my position in this place power- 
ful enough to guarantee that, since the arranging of these delights 
depends exclusively upon me, you have never to fear that they be 
unavailable to you? Tush. Follow us. All’s quiet. Did I not tell 
you that uncommon sights await you ?” 

Delbéne lights a little lantern, she walks ahead, Volmar, Fla- 
vie, and I follow. We enter the chapel ; to my astonishment I see the 
Superior bend, a tombstone lifts, a way is opened, she descends into 
the sanctuary of the dead. My initiated companions go after her 
in silence; I betray a certain uneasiness, Volmar reassures me. 
Delbéne lowers the stone slab above us. We are now in subterranean 
vaults that serve as sepulcher to all the women who have died in 
the convent. We proceed; another stone is swung aside, some fifteen 
or sixteen downward steps bring us to a low-ceilinged room decor- 
ated with much artistry and ventilated by air coming from the 
gardens above by a shaft. Oh, my friends! whom do you think I 
found there . . . Laurette, clad and decked like the vestals they 
used in olden times to immolate in the shrine of Bacchus; the Abbé 
Ducroz, first vicar to the Archbishop of Paris, a man of thirty 
years, very goodly to look upon, his special employment was the 
supervision of Panthemont—he was there; so was Father Téléme, 
a handsome dark dog of a Récollet friar, thirty-six, confessor to 
the novices and the pensionnaires. 

‘She is afraid,” said Delbéne, going toward these two men 
and presenting me to them; “hear, young innocent,” she continued, 
bestowing kisses upon me, “‘that our sole motive for congregating 
in this place is fuckery, the perpetration of sundry horrors, oc- 
casional atrocities. If we thus burrow far down into the realm of 
the dead, it is to be at the greatest possible remove from the living. 
When one is a libertine, as depraved, as vicious as are we, one likes 
to be in the bowels of the earth so as the better to avoid the inter- 
ference of men and their ridiculous law.” 

Well along as I was in the career of lubricity, these opening 
remarks, I confess, disturbed me not a little. 


56 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Heavens!” I cried, much moved, “what are we about to per- 
form in these underground tunnels ?”” 

“Crimes,” said Delbeéne. “We are going to soil ourselves with 
crimes before your very eyes, we are going to teach you to imitate 
us. Do you think you’l) weaken? Am I mistaken in my confidence 
in you? I’ve told these our colleagues that you can be relied upon.” 

“Still your doubts,” I replied energetically, “lay on your hands, 
I swear to it, whatever you do, it will stir up not a quaver of fear 
in me.” 

Therewith Delbéne orders Volmar to undress me. 

“She’s owner to the world’s fairest ass,’ was the Vicar’s 
expressed opinion as soon as he saw me entirely naked. 

And, instantly, kisses and fingerings were applied to my but- 
tocks; then, clapping one hand over my scarcely fledged cunt, the 
man of God undertook to tickle up his member by rubbing it in 
the cleft between my bu:tocks and so that it grazed my little hole, the 
which he penetrated forthwith, virtually without effort, and at the 
same moment Téléeme slid his gear into my cunt. Both discharged 
together and I answere:] almost at once. 

“Juliette,” the Superior announced, “we have just afforded 
you the two greatest pleasures a woman can enjoy; you must be 
candid now, and tell mz which of the two gave you the greater de- 
light.” 

“Truth to tell, Madame,” said I, “each gave me such pleasure 
I cannot decide which gave me the more. Reverberations are yet 
going through me of s2nsations at once so confused and so volup- 
tuous that I would be hard put to assign them their proper origins.” 

“Then we'd best «ry it again,” Téleme observed; ‘“‘the Abbot 
and I will vary our attacks, the lovely Juliette will have the good- 
ness to interrogate her sentiments and to favor us with a more 
exact account thereof.” 

“Most willingly,” I said; “I am of your mind that ’tis only 
by beginning afresh that I’ll be able to decide.” 

“Charming, isn’t she?’ murmured the Superior. ‘“There’s 
more than enough there to result in the prettiest little whore we've 
developed in decades; but this thing must be managed not only in 
order that Juliette discharge deliciously, but so that some of the 


Juliette & $7 


pleasures she is about to taste have their delightsome repercus- 
sions upon ourselves.” 

Pursuant to these libertine projects, the tableau was compo- 
sed in this manner: 

Téléme, who'd just fucked my cunt, arranged himself in my 
ass; his device was a shade thicker than his confrere’s, but, novice 
though I was, Nature had apparently so well modeled me for these 
doings that I confronted an increased diameter with an accommoda- 
ting elasticity. I was lying flat upon the Superior, in such wise that 
my clitoris was directly over her mouth, and the gay wench, hap- 
pily sprawled on the hard stone floor, was sucking like a babe on a 
teat; her thighs were wideflung. Between them, Laurette, bent over 
her, was treating her as I was being dealt with and, rocked by 
pleasure, the lewd thing was frantically masturbating Volmar on 
one side and Flavie on the other. Behind Laurette, Ducroz was 
gently frigging his tool on her buttocks, but without penetrating 
them; the question of honor—that of this child’s two pucelages— 
concerned no one but me. 

All these scenes of fuckery were preceded by a moment of sus- 
pense, of calm; as though the participants wished in stillness and 
contemplation to savor voluptuousness in its entirety, as though 
they feared lest, by talking, they might let some of it escape. I was 
requested to be attentive, alert in my pleasure-taking; for later 
I should be expected to report on the experience. I swam in a word- 
less ecstasy; and, I confess, the incredible pleasures evoked by the 
strident and persisting activity of Téléme’s prick in my ass, the 
lubricious agonies into which I was plunged by the Abbess’ tongue 
flitting over, needling my clitoris, the luxuriant scenes environing 
me, the combination of so many lascivious elements gripped my 
senses in a delirium and in that delirium I wanted to live an eternity. 

Téléme was the first to try to speak; but his stammers, his 
gasps much better expressed his disorder than his ideas. We could 
make out nothing in this incoherence but oaths, although he seemed 
to be endeavoring to say that the extreme heat and constriction of 
my anus had driven him wild. 

At last, mastering himself, he made it known that he was 
ready to discharge into the most clivine of all asses: “I know not 
whether Juliette will be more content to receive my fuck in her 


58 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


entrails than she was to feel it spewed into her cunt; but, for my 
part, I swear that, sodomizing her, I feel ten thousand times more 
pleasure than I got in her vagina.” 

“Purely a question of taste,” remarked Ducroz, who had aug- 
mented the tempo and ferce of his friggery upon Laurette’s ass and 
who was kissing Flavie’s apace. 

“A question of one’s philosophy, of the manner of one’s 
reasoning,” contended Volmar, being sharply frigged by Delbéne 
and tonguing Ducroz; “although a woman, my opinion is the same, 
and I protest that were I a man, I’d never fuck anywhere but in 
assholes.” 

Pronouncing these impure remarks, the voluptuous creature 
discharges. Téleme follows a moment later; he waxes furious; 
twisting my head toward him, he rams a foot’s length of tongue into 
my mouth; meanwhile, Delbene is sucking me with such telling 
effect that I cease to struggle. I wish to scream my pleasure, 
Téléme’s squirming tongue stops my words, the libertine drinks my 
sighs; I flood my suckeress’ lips, fill her mouth, flood her throat, 
and she herself speeds a torrent into Laurette’s gullet; Flavie 
joins us the next instant and the charming thing ejaculates her 
fuck while swearing like a trooper. 

“Now on to something else,” says Delbene, regaining her 
feet. ‘‘Ducroz, encunt Juliette, she'll lie in your arms. Volmar, also 
lying on her belly, will busy herself pumping Juliette’s asshole; 
I'll slip under Volmar to suck her clitoris; while Téléme encunts 
me, Flavie will do what she can for his anus as Téléme devotes a 
free hand to massaging J_aurette’s cunt while he fucks mine.” 

Further outpourings in homage to Cypris terminated this 
second experimental affray ; and then I was questioned. 

“Oh, my heart,” I answered Delbéne—it was she conducted 
the inquiry—‘since I must reply truthfully, I shall afirm that the 
member that was introduced into my hind parts caused me infini- 
tely more intense and more delicate sensations than that other 
which traveled me frontwise. I am young in years and in exper- 
ience, shy, unacquainted with and perhaps ill-made for the pleasures 
wherewith I have just teen gratified beyond all common measure; 
it were wholly possible that I be mistaken upon the kind and vio- 


Juliette ®& 59 


lence of these pleasures themselves, but you demand to know what 
I have felt and I have told you.” 

“Come, give me a kiss, my angel,” spoke Madame Delbéne, 
“‘you are a splendid girl and in fitting company. Ah, no doubt of it,” 
she proceeded enthusiastically, ‘no doubt whatever can exist, no 
pleasure can match what you have in the ass: woe betide those 
simple-minded, fainthearted chits who, lacking significantly in 
imagination, dare not attempt the true adventure. Impoverished 
creatures, these, they shall never be worthy to sacrifice to Venus, 
and never shall the Goddess of Paphos reward them with her 
favors !* 

“Oh, may I now be embuggered too!” cried the whore, kneel- 
ing on a divan. ‘‘Volmar, Christ’s guts! Where are you, Volmar? 
Flavie! Juliette! Outfit yourself with stout weaponry, and you, 
Ducroz and Téléme, stiffen your pikes and set them mischievously 
to worrying the assholes of these three bitches! And there’s my 
own ass, mark the hole? Fuck it, all of you! Laurette, lie quiet 
there before me while I have at you as my impulses bid me.” 

The Superior’s orders are acted upon. From the manner in 
which the libertine welcomes her attackers, ’tis plainly to be seen 
how inured she is to this hard use. While one of the actresses is 
toiling over her, a second, bending beneath her, tickles her clitoris 
or nips her labia; through synchronization of these twin activities, 
the patient’s joy is mightily enhanced, it is never really entire save 
when a steady and soothing frontwise masturbation to the bumwise 
intromissions adds the tart seasoning which can be imparted by a 


4 Gentle and most lovable creatures whom libertinage, laziness, or adversity has 
reduced to the lucrative and delicious estate of whores, pay closest heed to this 
counsel; well you see that here it is no less than the fruit of much wisdom and broad 
experience. Ass-fuck, my fair friends, ’tis the one way to amuse yourselves and 
prosper. Remember that they who bar you this pleasure are moved by nought but 
idiotic prejudice, unless it be by basest jealousy. You fastidious and sensitive wives 
who read me, accept the same advice; do as did versatile Proteus, be now this, now 
that, with your husbands and, gratifying them in every manner and at every turn, 
you'll have them all to yourselves. Be most certain of it: of all the resources coquetry 
offers you, buggery is at once the safest and most winning. And you young girls, 
seduced in the bower of your innocence, remember well that by presenting only your 
ass for a target you infinitely lessen the risks you run, both as touches your honor 
and your health: no offspring, virtually never any illnesses, and pleasures a thousand- 
fold sweeter.

knowledgeable fricatrice. The mounting irritation drove Delbene 
mad: in this woman, passions spoke an imperious language. We 
soon began to notice that the little Laurette was the target less of 
Delbéne’s caresses than of her rage: she was becoming covered 
with bites, pinches, scratches. 

“O Jesusfuck!” Delbene finally screamed as Téleme sodom- 
ized and Volmar titillared her, ‘“‘ah fuck! fuck! I’m discharging, 
you are slaying me with delight, enough! Enough, ’tis done. . . 
let’s sit down now, let’s talk a bit... . There’s more to it than just 
experiencing sensations, they must also be analyzed. Sometimes it 
is as pleasant to discuss as to undergo them; and when one has 
reached the limit of one’s physical means, one may then exploit 
one’s intellect. We'll make a circle. Calm yourself, Juliette, you 
have a worried air—are you still afraid that we'll fail you? There’s 
your victim,” she said, pointing to Laurette, “‘you’ll encunt her, 
you'll embugger her, the thing is a certainty. Rely upon a libertine’s 
promise, as you may upon his excessive behavior. Téleme, and 
you, Ducroz, place yourselves close by me; while speaking I'd like 
to handle your pricks, ] want to put them back in size again, my 
fingers will infuse them with energy, I want that energy to electrify 
my speech. You'll see my eloquence swell, not like Cicero’s, in 
accordance with the gestures and movements of the people clustered 
round the tribune, but l:ke Sappho’s, in proportion to the fuck she 
wrung from fair Damophile. 

“I do declare,” were Delbéne’s next words, spoken once she 
had reached the state <.ppropriate for holding discourse, ‘‘in this 
world I wonder at noth.ng so much as at the moral education girls 
are commonly given. It would appear as if its one aim were to 
instill notions and doc:rines that contradict all the natural im- 
pulses in our maidens. Is anyone able to tell me, for I sincerely 
wish to know, of what use a prudent, well-behaved woman can be 
to society? and whether there is anything more superfluous than 
the practice of this vi-tue which, with every passing day, only 
further numbs and minzs our sex? We women exist in two situa- 
tions wherein these practices are recommended to us; I am going 
to undertake to prove tat, in either phase of a woman’s life, they 
are of the most thorough inutility. 

“Up until the time a girl marries, of what conceivable advan- 


Juliette @ 61 


tage can preserving her virginity be to her? And how can folly be 
carried to the point where one believes a female creature is worth 
more or less for having one part of her body a little more or a 
little less enlarged? For what purpose has Nature created every 
human being? Is it not for giving mutual aid one to the other; and 
consequently for giving others all the pleasures it is in one’s power 
to dispense? Well, if it be true that a man may expect very great 
pleasures from a young girl, do you not fly in the face of Nature’s 
intentions and laws when you saddle this poor little thing with a 
ferocious virtue that forbids her from lending herself to this man’s 
impetuous desires ? Can you allow such barbarity without advancing 
some justification for it? And what justification are you going to 
propose in order to convince me that the child in question does well 
by remaining a virgin? Your religion, your customs, your habits? 
And, I ask you, what baser drivel, what more contemptible argu- 
ments can you find? I'll leave religion aside, I know all of you well 
enough to be certain of the slight credit you accord that trash. But, 
conventions, ah, conventions—may I be so bold as to ask you what 
they are? If I am not mistaken, the term applies to the kind of 
behavior observed by the individuals of a nation at home and in 
public. Now you will surely agree that these conventions ought to 
be based upon furtherance of individual happiness; if they do not 
ensure it, they are ridiculous; if they are harmful to it, they are 
atrocious, and an enlightened nation must set straightway to work 
rectifying these conventions directly it is manifest that they no 
longer conduce to the general welfare. You will now demonstrate 
to me what, if anything, in French customs and manners, insofar 
as carnal pleasure is concerned, can truly be said to conspire to our 
national happiness; in the name of what do you constrain this dear 
little creature to hang on to her maidenhead, this in flagrant dis- 
regard of Nature—Nature, who advises her to be rid of it—in 
disregard, likewise, of her health—her health which restraint can 
only wreck! Are you going to reply that all this is so that she can 
be pure when she arrives in her husband’s arms? But is this fancied 
necessity that she be pure anything other than the invention of 
prejudice-racked minds? What! To give some fellow the frivolous 
pleasure of plucking first fruits, you’re going to have the wretched 
lass deny herself for ten years? she’s to cause five hundred suitors 


62 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pain in order to provide one with a moment of fool’s delight? Can 
you think of anything more outlandish, does any more ill-conceived 
scheme exist? Can you, I ask, can you show me a more flagrant 
example of outrage to the general interest? Has the common 
welfare any greater enemy than these abhorrent conventions? Long 
live those people who, dwelling in ignorance of these disgraceful 
puerilities, to the contrary esteem only the young persons of our 
sex in proportion to the disorderliness they exhibit in their con- 
duct! Only in these multiple and iterated extravagances does a 
girl’s true virtue reside; the more she gives herself, the more 
lovable she is; the more she fucks, the more happiness she distrib- 
utes and the more she 1s instrumental to her countrymen’s happi- 
ness. They are sordid barbarians, these husbands who stick by the 
vain pleasure of plucking a rose: ’tis despotism, they claim this 
right at the expense of other men’s well-being. An end te this 
disesteem for the girl who, having no previous acquaintance with 
them, has not been able to wait to make them a gift of the most 
precious thing she has aid who, if she has heeded Nature’s prompt- 
ings, has had every reason for not waiting. Shall we now investigate 
the necessity of virtue i:1 women whose situation is that of a wife? 
The matter is now one of adultery, I should like to go thoroughly 
into this popularly alleged misdemeanor. 

“Our customs, manners, religious beliefs, codes, regulations 
—all these sordid local factors merit no consideration in this 
survey; the point is not to discover whether adultery is a crime in 
the eyes of the Laplander who permits it, or of the Frenchman 
who hammers it, but to make out whether humanity is wronged or 
Nature offended by this act. In order to entertain such a hypothesis, 
one must first be in total ignorance of the scope of the physical 
desires with which the common mother of mankind has endowed 
both sexes. Obviously, if one man were sufficient to a single woman’s 
desires, or if one woman could appease the ardors of any single 
man, then, within the framework of this hypothesis, whosoever 
violated the law would also outrage Nature. But if the fickleness 
and the insatiability of these desires are such that more than one 
man is necessary to women as an abundance of women is to men, 
you will, I presume, concede that, such being the case, whatever 
law -opposes their desires is tyrannical and plainly at daggers

drawn with Nature. The pseudo-virtue called chastity, unmistakably 
the most ridiculous of existing superstitions in that this mode of 
being does nothing in the slightest to make others happy and 
wreaks incalculable harm on the prosperity of everyone, since this 
virtue imposes exceedingly cruel privations upon all; this pseudo- 
virtue, I say, being the idol which dread of adultery makes us 
worship, every sane mind ought first of all to give chastity an 
eminent position amongst the most odious devices whereby man 
has seen fit to encumber and rout the inspirations of Nature. Let’s 
probe to the heart of the matter: the importance of the need to 
fuck is no less high than our need to eat and drink, and one ought 
to indulge in them all with equal unrestraint. Modesty, and of this 
we may be perfectly sure, was originally designed as nothing but a 
stimulant to lust: the engaging idea was to postpone desire’s ful- 
fillment in order to increase excitement, and fools subsequently took 
for a virtue what was merely a contrivance of libertinage.° It is as 
ridiculous to pretend that chastitv is a virtue as it would be to 
assert that it is a virtue to deprive oneself of food. May it be 
clearly noted: it is almost,always the stupid importance we assign 
to something which in the end elevates it to the stature of a virtue or 
of a vice; let us have done with our unseemly prejudices: let it 
become as ordinary and simple a matter to inform a girl, a boy, or 
a woman that one has an inclination to sport about with him or her, 
as it is, when one is in a foreign household, to request means to 
alleviate one’s hunger or thirst—let it become an everyday affair 
and you'll see the prejudice collapse and disappear, you'll see 
chastity cease to be a virtue and adultery cease to be a crime. Come, 
come! what wrong do I commit, what injury do I do when, en- 
countering some attractive creature, I say: 

‘‘*Pray avail me of that part of your body which is capable of 
giving me a moment’s satisfaction, and, if you are so inclined, 


5 Solitary, man blushes at nothing; modesty grips him only when he is surprised 
in the act, which proves that modesty is a ridiculous prejudice, absolutely unrecognized 
by, absolutely alien to, Nature. Man is impudicious born, his impudicity he has from 
Nature; civilization may tamper with her laws, but never shall civilization extirpate 
them from the philosopher’s soul. “Hominem planto,” said Diogenes, as he fucked by 
the side of the road; and why be more eager to conceal oneself when planting a man 
than a cabbage? 


64 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


amuse yourself with whatever part of mine may be agreeable to 
you.’ 

‘In what way does my proposal injure the- creature whose 
path I’ve crossed? What harm will result from the proposal’s 
acceptance? If about me there is nothing that catches his fancy, 
why then, material profiz may readily substitute itself for pleasure, 
and for an indemnity agreed upon through parley, he without 
further delay accords me the enjoyment of his body; and I have 
the inalienable right to employ force and any coercive means called 
for if, in having satisied him according to my possibilities— 
whether it be with my purse or with my body—he dares for one 
instant withhold from me what I am fairly entitled to extract from 
him. Only he offends Nature who refuses what may oblige his 
fellow; I outrage her not in the least, not I, when I offer to buy what 
arouses my interest and to pay the fairly arranged price for what 
is lent for my use. No, no, I repeat: chastity is no virtue; it is a 
conventional form, that’s all. The libertine intelligence, perpetually 
in search of refinements, invented chastity as such; chastity is arti- 
ficial, in no wise natural; and a girl, a woman, and a boy, granting 
their favors to the first comer, prostituting themselves with effron- 
tery and in every sense, everywhere, all the time, would possibly— 
I don’t deny the possibility—be committing something contrary to 
the usages that might te current in their country; but in no wise 
would they or could thzy thereby be doing wrong either to their 
neighbors—whom such behavior does not wrong, but rather serves 
—or to Nature—whose purposes are nought but furthered by all 
the excesses of libertinage it is in our mortal power to indulge in 
and perpetrate. Continence, be very certain of it, is the virtue of 
fools and enthusiasts; it is laden with perils, has not one good or 
wholesome effect; to men it is just as pernicious as to women; it 
damages health, in that it allows semen to stand and putrify in the 
loins, whereas this seme. has been produced to be expelled from the 
body, like any other secretion or excretion. In brief, the most fright- 
ful moral corruption is incalculably less a threat to one’s well-being ; 
and the most celebrated among the world’s peoples, as well as their 
most illustrious individual representatives, have always been the 
most debauched. The having of women, freely and in common, is 
the express wish of Nature, the arrangement is widespread in the 


Juliette 2% 65 


world, animals set us the example; it is absolutely contrary to that 
universal agent’s inspirations and intentions to wed a man to one 
woman, as in Europe it is done, or a woman to several men, as in 
certain regions of Africa, or a man to several women, as in Asia 
and European Turkey; all these institutions are revolting, they 
hobble the desires, they dam the humours, they enfetter the 
impulses and emasculate the will, and from all these infamous con- 
ventions there results nought but woe, ill, sorrow, and blight. Oh, 
those of you who have the temerity to govern men, beware, I say, 
put no bonds upon any living creature! Leave him free to shift for 
himself, leave to him alone the task of seeking out that which suits 
him best, do that and you shall speedily observe the state of affairs 
ameliorated, for it can only improve. Thereupon every rational man 
will say: ‘Why, simply because ] need now and then to spill a little 
seed, must I bind myself indissolubly to a person I'll never love? 
Of what use can it be that this same need cause a hundred wretches 
whose names I don’t even know to become my thralls? Why must 
this need, in a woman the same save in one or two details, subject 
her to perpetual slavery and humiliation?’ Ye gods, that woebegone 
girl’s all afire with urges, the need to slake twenty thirsts consumes 
her, and you, what are you going to do to relieve her? you're going 
to tie her fate to a single man’s .. . and that man? are you so sure 
his taste in pleasures will correspond so faultlessly to hers? could it 
not turn out, as sometimes does happen, that he lies with her three 
times, four times in the course of his life, or that his employment of 
her consists merely in submitting her to pleasures in which the young 
thing cannot possibly share? What arrant injustice on both sides, 
and how well it is avoided by abrogating your senseless marriages, 
by leaving the two sexes at liberty to consult their wishes and to 
look for and find exactly what they require one of the other. What 
good does society glean from marriages? Far from fortifying at- 
tachments, it dissolves them: it manufactures not friends, but foes; 
which, in your judgment, seems to be the more firmly united: one 
great family—as might become every nation on earth—or five or 
six million little families whose interests, inevitably personal, in- 
evitably clash, create divisions, and forever jar with the general 
interest? What’s this idle talk about liberty, equality, fraternity, 
what’s this unity and brotherhood among men so long as every- 


66 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


one, brothers, fathers, mothers, wives go on struggling against one 
another? Unity means universality; do I hear you object that this 
universality will weaken ties, that there’ll be no more of them ow- 
ing to the universal bond? Well, what does it matter? Is it not far 
preferable to have none than to retain this sort, whose only purpose 
can be to stir up trouble and spread disaffection? We glance at 
history. What of the leagues, the factions, the numerous parties 
which have reft France owing to the prevailing practice of allying 
oneself to one’s family and with it battling against every other 
family ; do you, I ask, do you suppose we would have had all that 
had there been but one family in France? Would this grand family 
have broken up into men-at-arms, troops fighting tooth and nail, 
some for a tyrant, others for the opposing party? There'd have 
been no Orléanais at the Burgundians’ throats, no Guises pitted 
against Bourbons, none of all those horrors which tore France 
asunder and whose one source was the pride and ambition of individ- 
ual families. Those passions evaporate with the equality I propose; 
they wither into oblivion once the absurdities known as marital ties 
are destroyed; what remains? a homogeneous, tranquil State, with 
One attitude, one objective, one desire: to live happily together, 
and together to defend the fatherland. The machine cannot possibly 
avoid breaking down before long if the customs and usages in force 
today are maintained. Wealth and property concentrating in the 
hands of a few, this few becoming fewer through constant inter- 
marriage, within a hundred years’ time the State will necessarily be 
divided into two factions, one so powerful and so rich that it will 
topple and crush the other: and the country will be laid waste.® 
“Ponder the matter and you'll discover that there has never 
been any other cause for all our difficulties. One power, quietly 
gathering strength, has always ended up trying to overwhelm the 
other, and has always succeeded. An ounce of prevention is worth 
a pound of cure, my friends: abolish marriages. Away with those 
abhorrent chains; enough of these bitter regrets; no more of these 
hardships, these crimes, the consequences of these monstrous abuses, 
you'll be rid of them a!l the day you’re done with these laws: for 
laws alone create the czime; and the crime is gone as soon as the

law ceases to exist. No more enclaves within the State, no more con- 
spiracies, no more shocking inequalities of wealth; but children... 
population? ... We'll deal with those articles next. 

‘““We begin by establishing a fact which we are prone to con- 
sider incontrovertible: that, during the carnal act, extremely little 
thought is devoted to the creature which may be its result; he who 
were stupid enough to preoccupy himself with the question would 
most assuredly cut his pleasure in half. Manifestly, he is a blithering 
ass who with this idea in his head goes to see a woman, and no less 
an ass he who when seeing a woman gets this idea. It is erroneous 
that propagation is supposed to be one of Nature’s laws, if we 
imagine such nonsense our pride alone is to blame. Nature permits 
propagation, but one must take care not to mistake her tolerance 
for an enjoinder. Nature stands in not the slightest need of propa- 
gation; and the total disappearance of mankind—this being the 
worst consequence of a refusal to propagate—would grieve her very 
little, she would no more pause in her career than if the whole 
species of rabbits or chickens were suddenly to be wiped off the 
face of the earth. Thus, we no more serve Nature in reproducing 
ourselves than we offend her in not doing so. Be amply persuaded 
of it, this wonderful propagation, inflated into a virtue by our 
preposterously overdrawn self-esteem, if viewed from the stand- 
point of Nature’s functionings, becomes entirely superfluous, and a 
subject over which we ought to trouble ourselves as little as possible. 
Brought together by the instincts of pleasure, two beings of unlike 
sex ought to put their best efforts into enjoying themselves as thor- 
oughly as ever they can; their task is to employ all their faculties 
and attentions to improving and increasing their pleasure; and the 
eventual outcome of this pleasure-taking? devil take the bloody 
consequences, that’s the proper attitude, for Nature herself couldn’t 
care less about them.’ 


7Oh, mortal man! you believe it a crime against Nature you commit when you 
take an opposing stand to prcpagation or when you destroy the matured fruit of 
your loins, and never does it occur to you that the destruction of a thousand, nay, 
of a million times as many mortals as are now on the earth’s surface would cost 
Nature not a single tear and would introduce not the slightest change in the regu- 
larity of her functions; ’tis thus not for us that all has been wrought, and if we did 
Not exist at all, all else would be as now it is noetwithstanding. What then are we in 
Nature’s eyes? and how dare we make such a great case of our insignificant selves?

“With regard to the father, he is in no wise concerned with 
whatever issue may occur, if issue there should be. And, with the 
assumption that women are held in common, which is what they 
should be and had better be soon, what concern could he conceivably 
have? He spits a little sperm into a receptacle everyone else relieves 
himself into, a womb where what can germinate does germinate; 
how is this gesture to turn into the grave obligation to look after a 
fertilized egg? No, he has no more duties to observe toward a 
foetus than he would toward something deposited by an insect and 
which some shit he drovped at the foot bf a tree caused to hatch 
several days later; in both cases I have cited; the problem is simply 
one of some matter of which a man needs to get rid and which sub- 
sequently becomes whatever it happens to become. The embryo is 
to be considered the woman’s exclusive property; as the sole owner 
of this fruit rather jestingly called precious, she can dispose of it as 
she likes. She can destroy it in the depths of her womb if it proves 
a nuisance to her. Or after it ripens and is born, if she is for any 
reason displeased with it or irked at having produced it, she can 
destroy it then; whatever the circumstances, infanticide is her 
sacred right. Her spawn is hers, entirely hers, and no one else can 
claim this bit of property belonging to no one else, utterly useless 
to Nature, and hence the mother may feed it or she may strangle 
it, depending upon her preference. Ah, you've no need to fear a 
dearth of children; there will be only too many women who'll be 
eager to bring up what they whelp; and if it’s manpower for de- 
fending the country or tilling the soil you’re anxious about, you 
will always have more of it than you'll know what to do with, To 
these ends, create public schools where, as soon as they are weaned, 
the young may be reared; installed therein as ward of the State, 
the child can forget even his mother’s name. After he has grown 
up, let him in his turn couple indiscriminately, democratically, with 
his mates and brethren, doing as his parents did before him. 

“Given these principles, you now see what adultery amounts 
to, and whether it is possible or true that a woman can do wrong 
in surrendering herself to whoever catches her fancy. Determine 
for yourselves whether everything would not continue very nicely 
even with the overthrow of every last one of our laws. But these 
laws—are they so very general? Do all races and peoples have the 


Juliette & 69 


same respect for these miserable ties? It might serve to make a 
rapid historico-geographical survey if we feel that our attitude 
would benefit from the support of a few precedents. 

“So then, we notice that in Lapland, in Tartary, in America, 
they consider it an honor to prostitute their wives to wayfaring 
_ strangers. 

“The Illyrians hold special conclaves for the purposes of de- 
bauchery; at them, they force their wives to give themselves to all 
comers; the thing is performed within public view. 

“Adultery was publicly authorized among the Greeks. The 
Romans lent one another their spouses. Cato made his available to 
Hortensius, for the latter had no fertile wife of his own. 

“In Tahiti, Cook discovered a society in which all the women 
give themselves indifferently to all the assembled men. But if a 
later consequence of this rite is pregnancy, the woman smothers the 
child the instant it is born: splendid evidence, this, that there do 
after all exist people of sufficient intelligence to set their pleasures 
on a higher plane than the futile laws enjoining us to increase 
numerically! Differing only in a few particulars, a similar society 
thrives at Constantinople.® 

“The blacks of what we call the Spice Coast and of Riogabar 
prostitute their wives to their own children. 

“Singha, Queen of Angola, published a law which established 
the vulgivagiibilité of women: one which, that is to say, made 
their cunts as free universally to be fucked as air is to be breathed. 
A chapter of this same edict made it incumbent upon women to take 
the measures necessary to thwart pregnancy; evidence having been 
adduced thereof, disobedience was punished capitally: the culprit 
was ground in a mortar. A severe law, perhaps, but useful, being 
exceedingly favorable to the conservation of the integrity of the 
community whereof the size is to be limited if the somber conse- 
quences of excessive numbers are to be avoided. 

“But there are milder means for keeping population trimmed 

8It flourishes in Persia too. Likewise, also, do the Brahmins forgather, to give 
each other their wives, their daughters, their sisters to be fucked reciprocally. 

Among the Bretons of old, eight or ten husbands would convene and put their 
wives at the disposal of the company; se'fish interests, factions discourage these 


delicious traffickings here in France; and I ask: when shall we be philosophers enough 
to establish them ?

to neat and sensible dimensions: they would be by encouraging and 
recompensing sapphism, sodomy, and infanticide, as in Sparta 
theft was honored. Thus might the scales be maintained in balance, 
without there being the need to obliterate women’s fruit even while 
it is in the womb, as is common practice in Angola and Formosa. 

“For example, in France, where the population is far too 
large, while establishing the vulgivaguibilité | am partisan to, one 
would also have to set a maximum figure to child-production, to 
drown the surplus, and, as I have just said, to venerate the presently 
unlawful commerce between persons of the same sex. The govern- 
ment, under these ideal conditions invested with entire authority 
over these children and over the regulation of their number, would 
be able automatically to calculate the strength of its defensive 
soldiery by the number of warriors it had raised, and no longer 
would the State have cities full of thirty thousand starving wretches 
to feed in time of famine. It is going a bit too far when one respects 
a little fertilized matter to the point of imagining that one cannot, 
when need be, destroy it before birth or even a good while after 
that. 

“There is, in China, a society similar to those of Tahiti and 
Byzantium. I allude to the society called that of the Complacent 
Husbands. They will marry girls only upon condition those girls 
have prostituted themselves to others; their homes are asylums of 
multiform luxury. They drown the offspring begot of this trade. 

“In Japan there exist women who, though married, with their 
husbands’ approval frequent the vicinity of temples and station 
themselves by the highways; they expose their breasts, as Italian 
harlots do, and are constantly prepared to satisfy whatever needs 
of whatever clients chance brings their way. 

“At Cambay there is to be seen a pagoda, destination of 
pilgrims, and thither every woman betakes herself with utmost 
piety: there, they prostitute themselves, and no husband carps at 
their behavior. They who finally accumulate a certain capital from 
their work usually purchase young slaves whom they ready for like 
employment and then take along to the pagoda, and thus are 
fortunes amassed.?

“In Pegu, the husband is supremely contemptuous of a virgin 
wife’s favors; he enlists the aid of a friend, who clears the obstruc- 
tions away; often, he will request help from a well-disposed and 
total stranger. But the same traditions do not apply to the initiation 
of a young boy. For the inhabitants of Pegu, this pleasure is prized 
above all others. 

“The female Indians of Darien prostitute themselves to any- 
one at all. If they are married, the husband accepts the charge of 
the child; if they are unwed, pregnancy would dishonor them, so 
they have themselves aborted or in their coupling observe those 
precautions which are guarantee against this inconvenience. 

“In faraway Cumana, newly wedded girls lose their maiden- 
heads to priests; the husband will have nought to do with them 
until this ceremony has been performed. That inestimable treasure, 
virginity, thus owes its value simply to national prejudices, as do 
so many other things which we are reluctant to view for what they 
are in reality. 

“For how long did not the feudal lords of several European 
provinces, in Scotland above all, exploit the same right ? Prejudices, 
superstitions, fads... this modesty . . . this virtue . . . this adultery. 

“No, not by any means do all peoples accord in cherishing 
maidenheads. The more gallant adventures a girl in North America 
has had, the more suitors court her. They spurn a virgin, her virgin- 
ity is a grave handicap to a girl: it demonstrates undesirability. 

_ “In the Balearic Islands, the husband is the last to enjoy his 
wife: every acquaintance, every chum, all the relatives precede him 
in this ceremony; a very strange and suspect person he would be 
thought, who resisted this prerogative. The same custom used to 
be observed in Iceland and by the Nazamaeans, an Egyptian tribe: 
after the wedding feast, the naked spouse went and lay one after 
the other with the wedding guests, and from each received a 
present. 

‘““We know that among the Massagetes every woman was held 
in common: when a man encountered one who pleased him, he bade 
her mount his chariot; in the matter she had no say at all, he hung 
his weapons on the shaft and that was enough to keep others away. 

“It was not by devising marriage laws but the reverse, by 
establishing the perfect community of women, that the Norse were 


72 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


powerful enough to humble Europe three or four times over, and 
to flood it with their emigrations. 

“Marriage, it thus appears, is noxious to population, and the 
globe is covered with peoples who despise the institution. Hence, 
in the eyes of Nature, it is contrary to individual happiness and 
generally to all things and practices which are capable of promoting 
and assuring man’s earthly felicity. Well, if it is adultery that 
smashes marriages, adultery that shatters laws, adultery that so 
emphatically concords with Nature’s laws, adultery might very 
easily pass for a virtue instead of a crime. 

“Oh, tender creatures, divine artifacts created for the pleas- 
ures of men, cease to believe that you were made for the enjoy- 
ment of only one man; utterly unafraid, beneath your proud heel 
grind to dust these absurd ties which, chaining you in the arms of a 
husband, are bar to the happiness you await from the lover you 
cherish. Consider rather that it is only by resisting his advances 
that you outrage Nature. Having made you the more sensitive, the 
more fiery of ‘the two sexes, in your heart Nature ingrained the 
desire to indulge unrestrainedly all your passions. Did she invite 
you to be the captive of a single man when she gave you force 
enough to drain the balls of four or five in a row? Scorn the vain 
canons which victimize you; they’re the contrivances of your 
enemies, for ’tis plain, is it not, that they weren’t invented by you? 
Since it is sure that you'd have been ill-disposed to approve them 
had your opinion been consulted, what right have these swine to 
exact obedience thereto? Remember that after a certain age you'll 
no longer please, and that in your later years you'll shed many a 
bitter tear if you’ve let youth go by without enjoying it; and what 
shall you obtain in return for this discretion, this shyness, this self- 
denial, what will be your reward when the loss of your charms 
robs you of the power to claim any consideration at all? Your 
husband’s esteem ?—fie! what an inadequate consolation! what 
miserly recompense for such enormous sacrifices! Furthermore, 
what assurance have you of their equity? what’s to prove to you 
that your constancy is as efficacious and as valuable as you suppose? 
Must your husband necessarily imitate your fidelity? Ah, there you 
see it for what it is: gratuitous; you feed yourself on pride. Oh, 
you women who are made to be loved, the scantiest pleasure 


Juliette & 73 


provided by a lover outweighs all the relief you'll derive from self- 
abuse: sheer illusions, those solitary pleasure-takings, no one be- 
lieves in them, no one will recognize your valor, yqu’ll earn no 
one’s thanks, no one’s gratitude; and in every case destined to be 
a victim, you'll perish that of prejudice instead of a victim of love. 
Love? Serve that master, young beauties, whilst you are young 
serve it fearlessly, this bountiful, this endearing god who created 
you to worship him; ’tis upon his altars, ’tis in the arms of his 
faithful you'll earn restitution for the minor annoyances which 
distinguish the debut of your career. Think only of taking the first 
step, thereafter the rest is easy, accomplish the gesture and the 
scales will fall from your eyes: you'll see that ’tis not modesty puts 
the bright flush into your youthful fair cheeks, but rather indigna- 
tion at having for one instant allowed yourselves to be bound by 
the contemptible restrictions atrocious parents or jealous husbands 
dared impose upon you for even the space of a single afternoon. 

“In the present lamentable state of affairs—and this composes 
the second part of my exposition—this appalling state of discom- 
fort and pressure and stress, for the time being we can do no 
better than provide some advice to women on how to cope with the 
situation and how best to behave in its light, and then to consider, 
through a probing examination, whether indeed any inconvenience 
results from this alien offspring the husband finds himself con- 
strained to adopt. 

“First, let’s determine whether it is not an empty myth, this 
husband’s notion that his honor and peace of mind are hinged to 
the conduct of his wife. 

“Honor! Our honor! Whose is my honor—mine or someone 
else's? And what has someone else to do with it? Would it not 
appear that the concept of a husband’s honor is but another crafty 
means husbands have devised and employ in order to obtain the 
more from their wives, in order to bind their wives more firmly to 
them? Oh, honor! Eh, then! ’tis all very permissible and very 
honorable that iniquitous husbands debauch themselves in every 
way under the sun and that, behave as they wish, their honor 
emerges unscathed? That wife the rakehell husband neglects, that 
passionate wife not one fifth of whose desires he bothers to satisfy, 
does she dishonor him when she resorts to another man? And 


74. THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


there are people—can you believe it ?—who answer in the afhirma- 
tive! But this is positively the same kind of madness, found among 
various peoples, which consists in the husband tucking into bed 
when the wife is giving birth. Let’s not be fools: our honor is ours, 
never can it depend upon what someone else does, and it is wild 
extravagance to imagine the faults others commit can in any wise 
have an impact upon us. 

“If then it is absurd to suppose that unto a man any dishonor 
can come through his wife’s conduct, what other injury can he 
possibly sustain therefrom? Either one or the other: this man 
loves his wife or he doesn’t love her. In the former instance, as 
soon as he finds her missing because she has repaired to another, it’s 
' that she no longer loves him; well, tell me whether the height of 
folly isn’t to go on loving somebody who has stopped loving you? 
The man in question ought as of this instant to cease being attached 
to his wife, and within this supposition inconstancy must be perfectly 
acceptable. If we are dealing with events arising from the second 
instance, if, no longer loving his wife, the husband has precipitated 
her inconstancy, what has he to complain about? He gets what he 
deserves, what he must necessarily get by behaving in the way he 
has; he would be committing the greatest injustice were he to 
whine, pule, snarl at ais wife or condemn her; hasn’t he ten 
thousand other objects all around him whereupon he can vent his 
feelings or wherewith he can soothe them? Let the good fellow 
leave his wife to amuse herself in peace; has he not made her 
unhappy enough alread:;? hasn’t he forced her to restrain herself 
while he, cavorting about, performed his little felonies in broad 
daylight and never heard opinion condemn them? Let him then 
leave her in peace, that she taste pleasures he can procure her no 
more, and his complacency may yet someday make a friend of the 
woman whom a contrary attitude enraged. Gratitude will then do 
what the heart couldn’t achieve; confidence will be reborn, and both, 
reaching the years of their decline, will together, clasped in friend- 
ship’s embrace, perhaps make up for what love denied them earlier. 

“Unjust husbands. an end then to harrying your wives 
because they are faithless. Take the trouble, have the manliness to 
cast critical eyes upon vour own selves, and you will always dis- 
cover that the initial fault was yours, and what will convince the 


Juliette % 75 


public that this first fault is always on your side is that all the 
prejudices disfavor infidelity in wives: thus, in order to be libertine, 
they have countless obstacles to surmount and ruptures to effect, 
and it is neither natural nor logical that the timid and gentle sex 
go so far unless impelled by irresistible causes. Is my hypothesis 
fallacious? Is the wife alone guilty? Well, even so, what good will 
it do the husband to believe it? What idiot will have his whole 
tranquillity depend upon what a wife does? Do his wife’s idle little 
carryings-on cause him any physical pain? Alas, no. All the injury 
he sustains is imaginary; his sufferings, what are they? they are 
mental. And their cause? Some activities which are admired five 
hundred leagues from Paris. Why does he suffer then? Because 
local prejudices train him to. What should he do? Free himself of 
those prejudices, spit upon them, and at once. Does one worry 
about wrongs done to one as a husband when as a man one plunges 
into the thick of fuckery’s pleasures? Hardly; why then, that’s 
what he’d better do, plunge, and all his wife’s carousings will be 
speedily forgotten. 

“Then it is not the act she’s committed, but its material 
consequences .. . this that’s hatched from an egg Monsieur didn’t 
fertilize, this chick Monsieur’s got nevertheless to admit into his 
brood; is this the cause of his sorrow ? What childishness! Here we 
have a brace of alternatives: you continue to cohabit with a wife, 
unfaithful though she be, so as to have heirs; or you don’t live with 
her anymore. Or again you live with her, as do certain libertine 
husbands, proceeding in such wise as to be sure that any infants she 
bears aren’t yours. Don’t let this latter possibility alarm you, your 
wife will prove astute enough not to present you with any children, 
give her a chance, rest assured, she’ll know what to do, children 
you'll have none: no woman who has sufficient intelligence to con- 
duct an intrigue will ever commit that blunder. In the former case, 
you have only, like your rival, to labor at multiplying the species— 
and who'll be able to convince you that the eventual results won’t 
have been brought about by you? The chances are as good for as 
against, and you'll be a very ass if you don’t adopt the more com- 
forting conclusion. Either do that, or stop altogether consorting 
with your wife directly you suspect she has an intrigue afoot— 
that’s the surest and best manner to preserve mastery of the 


76 ck THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


situation—; or if you continue to cultivate the same garden her 
lover is spading, don’t blame him any more than you blame your- 
self for having sown the seed that ripens into growth. 

“There then are the objections put forth and the replies to 
them: either, Sir, you shall surely have no children; or if you have 
any, it is an even wager whether they are yours or your competitor’s. 
In support of this latter statement there is a further probability: I 
refer to the inclination your wife is apt to have to mask her liaison 
behind a pregnancy, and this, you may be certain, will make her do 
everything on earth to get herself into your bed, for ’tis obvious 
she’ll never be at ease until she has felt you put balm on what ails 
her and until this treatment has guaranteed her freedom, from 
here on, to do as she likes with her lover. Your anxiety is hence 
utterly baseless, the child is yours, you may set your mind at rest; it 
is infinitely to your wife’s interest that it belong to you, you’ve toiled 
at its conception. Well, combine these two reasons and you obtain 
certainty concerning whzt you are so eager to know: the child is 
yours, no doubt of it, and it’s yours by the same reckoning which 
must make that one of two runners who is paid cross the finish line 
first, defeating his comrade who stands to gain nothing in the same 
race. But, nevertheless, .et’s suppose for a moment that the child 
isn’t yours. Well, what do you care? You wanted an heir, did you 
not? Now you have one. Not Nature but upbringing creates filial 
sentiments. Be persuaded that this child—whom nothing makes 
doubt that he is your son, accustomed to seeing you, to pronouncing 
your name, to loving you for his father—will revere you, cherish 
you as much and possibly more than if you had a hand in bringing 
about his existence. Well, what now? Do you still tremble? Your 
imagination sickens you; however, there’s nothing easier to cure 
than these ills. Give that imagination of yours a good jolt, agitate 
it with something whose grip, whose sway, is more potent, whose 
effect upon it is stronger, you'll soon knock it round into the shape 
and tenor you wish, and you'll have drubbed it into health. No 
matter what the case or its details may be, my philosophy offers you 
everything you need. Nothing is so much ours as our offspring— 
good: you've just been given a boy, there he is, he’s yours. Nothing 
belongs so much to us as what we’re given. Exercise your rights, 
and remember that a few pounds of organized matter, whether it 


Juliette @ 77 


belong to us or be the property of someone else, is of slight worth 
in the eyes of Nature who at all times bestows upon us the power 
to disorganize it whenever and however we please. 

“Tis now for you, charming wives, for you, my dear friends, 
to set the example. I have put your husbands’ minds at rest, I have 
taught those gentlemen that, irrespective of what you do, they 
need not lose a wink of sleep on your account; I am ready now to 
instruct you in that art of adroitly deceiving them, but first I’m 
going to make you shudder before the dreadful picture of all the 
penalties reserved for adultery—I show you this picture in order 
that you see what enormous pleasures this alleged crime must 
afford if everyone punishes it with such exceptional rigor, and in 
order also that you be moved to be thankful for having been born 
under a benign regime where opinion, leaving your conduct to your 
own conscience, penalizes you, if your conduct is not good, by 
attempting to make you feel some frivolous sentiment of shame for 
having dishonored yourselves. . . . And this dishonor . . . come, let’s 
admit it, ’tis, for the majority of us, an added charm. 

“A law proclaimed by the Emperor Constantine prescribed for 
adultery the same punishment meted out for parricide, to wit: the 
culprit was burned alive, either that or sewn in a sack and cast into 
the sea; those luckless women found guilty of the crime were de- 
prived even of the right to appeal their case. 

“A governor of a province had exiled a woman found guilty 
of adultery; Majorianus, deeming the punishment too light, ex- 
pelled the woman from Italy and decreed that whoever were to 
slay her had the Emperor’s permission so to do. 

“The ancient Danes punished the adulteress with death, while 
among them homicide meant the payment of a mere fine; that re- 
veals which of the two offenses they considered the graver. 

“The Mongols cleave an adulteress in two with a sword. 

“In the Kingdom of Tonkin, she is trampled by an elephant. 

“But in Siam, their ways are more lenient: she is otherwise 
delivered unto the elephant. A specially prepared contraption into 
which she is placed allows it to enjoy her in the belief it is tuppering 
a female elephant. Lewdness may well have been behind the inven- 
tion of this procedure. 

“In similar cases, the Bretons of long ago, and perhaps also 


78 %& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


with lewd motivations, were wont to flog the adulteress to death. 

“‘Luango is an African kingdom, and there they have the cus- 
tom of hurling her and her lover too from the top of a craggy 
mountain. 

“The Gauls used to smother her in mud and filth, then drag 
her body around in it awhile. 

“In Juida, the husband himself condemned his wife: he had 
her executed immediately, there before his eyes, if he found her 
guilty, all of which was a tradition of extreme convenience to 
husbands who were weary of their wives. 

“In other countries, the law empowers the husband to execute 
his spouse with his own hand if he finds that she has wronged him. 
This custom was notably that of the Goths.’ 

““Members of the Miami tribe hacked off an adulteress’ nose; 
the Abyssinians drove hzr from the house clad in rags and tatters. 

“The savages of Canada made an incision running round her 
head, then removed the strip of skin. 

“In the Eastern Roman Empire, the adulterous woman was 
prostituted in the market place. 

“At Diyarbekir, the criminal was executed by her assembled 
family, all of whose members had to deliver at least one thrust of 
a dagger. 

“In several Greek provinces where, in contrast to Sparta, this 
crime was unauthorized, anyone at all could kill an adulteress with 
impunity. 

“The Guax-Tolliams, as our French explorers call that Ameri- 
can tribe, led the adulteress before the feet of their chief, and 
there she was cut to pieces, and the pieces were eaten by the 
witnesses. 

“The Hottentots, who allow father-murder, matricide, and 
child-killing, frown upon adultery. They punish it by death; the 
delation even of a child is accepted as proof of the fact.

hope become a certainty that an act is criminal is always but one 
further pleasure for minds organized like ours, oh, my friends, 
hark unto my lessons, heed them, profit therefrom; to your 
lascivious intelligence I am going to expose the whole theory of 
adultery. 

‘Be never so unctious, so complacent with your husband as 
when you plan to deceive him. 

“If he is libertine, accommodate his desires, submit to his 
caprices, flatter all his whims however fantastical, even of your own 
accord present him with lust-inspiring objects. According to his 
bent and tastes, have either pretty girls or pretty boys about, 
cater to his requirements. Bound by gratitude, he'll never dare 
reproach you; and what, moreover, can he ever possibly accuse you 
of, whose other edge you cannot turn against him? 

‘You need a confidante: acting alone, the risks of disaster are 
great; so find yourself a woman you can trust, and omit nothing 
that will identify her interests with yours and your passions. Above 
all, pay her well. 

“For the satisfaction of your wants look rather to hired help 
than to a lover. The former will serve you well and in secrecy, the 
latter will fly about town boasting of his conquest and he'll dis- 
honor you without giving pleasure. 

“A lackey, a valet, a secretary, no one takes any notice of 
such creatures; but get yourself a little master and then you're 
lost, often without having gained much from it. 

“Do not breed. Nothing gives less pleasure than childbearing. 
Pregnancies are damaging to health, spoil the figure, wither the 
charms, and it’s the cloud of uncertitude forever hanging over 
those events that darkens a husband’s mood. There are a thousand 
means to avoid conception, five hundred more to forestall child- 
birth; ass-fuckery is by far the best and surest of all; have someone 
frig your clitoris meanwhile, and this manner of amusing yourself 
will Soon prove incomparably more pleasant than the other: your 
fuckers’ pleasure will probably increase too, your husband will 
notice nothing, and everyone will be content. 

‘Perhaps your husband himself will propose sodomy to you. 
If so, don’t be overhasty accepting the invitation: one must always 
have the look of refusing what one covets. If fear of having chil- 


80 e¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


dren forces you to suggest the thing yourself, advance the excuse 
that you are afraid of dying in labor; maintain that one of your 
friends has told you that her husband manages matters with her 
in that fashion. Once you’re broken in to these pleasures, taste no 
others with your lovers-—and now you've dissipated half the sus- 
picions anyone could have, and you're rid of all worry with preg- 
nancies. 

“Put spies on the track of your tyrant, have his movements 
watched; you must neve: lie in fear of being surprised if you wish 
to know an authentic joy. 

“If, however, you were to be found out, and were so flagrantly 
caught in the act as to be unable to deny your conduct, put on a 
show of remorse, redouble the care and attentions your husband 
wishes lavished upon him. If as a preliminary to your adventures 
your complacency and thoughtfulness have won you his friendship, 
he’ll soon come back for more; if he persists, be the first to lodge a 
complaint; make it clea: you know his secrets, threaten him with 
their divulgence; and it is so that you will always have this hold 
over him that I urge ycu to study his tastes, to encourage and to 
serve them from the outset of your marriage. Finally, approaching 
him from this angle, he’s yours, he'll return unfailingly. When he 
does, make things up with him and hand him whatever he wants, 
provided he pardons you too: but don’t be abused by this reconcilia- 
tion, multiply your precautions, more shrewdly veil your activities; 
a prudent wife must always be on guard lest she excessively irritate 
her husband. 

“Enjoy yourself to the limit. The limit? Discovery. If dis- 
covered, yield on every score, refuse nothing. 

‘Keep away from libertine women, insofar as that is possible 
today. Their company won’t procure you many pleasures and may 
cause you considerable 1arm; they display themselves more visibly 
than lovers, for it is known that one must conceal oneself with a 
man and that is not thcught necessary with a woman. 

“If you indulge ir. foursomes, let the other woman be your 
trusted friend: have a sharp eye out to discern what bonds, what 
commitments there are she must respect; don’t enter the party if she 
does not have roughly the same duties and obligations as you to 


Juliette & 81 


observe, for then she'll be less discreet than you, and her im- 
prudences will be your undoing. 

‘Always find some means for obtaining entire control over 
others, over, that is, their lives. Should a man betray you, don’t 
hesitate to take the straight way with him. There is no counter- 
poising that man’s life against your tranquillity; whence I con- 
clude that it’s a hundred times better to dispatch him than be made 
a show of or compromised by him. Not that reputation is essential ; 
it serves purely to consolidate one’s pleasure opportunities. A 
woman generally thought to be well-behaved regularly enjoys her- 
self far more and better than one whose overly publicized mis- 
conduct has cost her consideration. 

‘‘However, respect your husband’s life. I recommend that not 
because there is any individual on earth whose existence must be 
preserved if it conflicts with our private interest; but because, in the 
present case, our personal interest consists in safeguarding that 
husband’s days. "Tis a long and wearisome study for a wife, to 
come to know her husband; once the job’s done, there’s no need for 
her to have to begin anew with another; and it is not sure that the 
second will be any improvement upon the first. It’s not a lover she 
wants in her husband, it’s a complacent, understanding, and under- 
stood creature; and success is better assured by long habit than by 
novelty. 

“If the antiphysical pleasure-taking techniques I referred to 
a short moment ago are not able to arouse you, then cunt-fuck, I 
really don’t mind; but empty the vessel as soon as it has been filled; 
never let the embryo get a start, that’s of great importance if you 
don’t sleep with your husband and hardly any less important if 
you do, for, as I have told you, incertitude gives rise to every 
suspicion, and suspicion nearly always brings on scissions and 
commotion. 

‘Above all, subdue any respect you have for the civil or reli- 
gious ceremony that welds you to a man for whom you have no 
love or whom you love no longer or who does not suffice you. A 
Mass, a benediction, a contract, this mumbo jumbo—has it the 
force, the sanctity to make you willing to crawl in irons forever? 
That word given, that pledge, ’tis nought but a formality which 
confers upon a man the right to lie with a woman, but which is 


82 ef THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


binding neither upon the one party nor upon the other; and these 
alliances must appear the less serious to her who, of the twain, is, 
by this agreement’s terms, accorded the fewer means to unbind 
herself. You who are destined to go forth from here and live in 
the world,” said the Superior, fixing her glance upon me, “you, my 
dear Juliette, scorn these driveling inanities, flout them contemptu- 
ously, they merit nothing else. They are man-made conventions 
whereunto, irrespective of your wishes, they’d compel you to ad- 
here: a costumed charlatan flutters round a table, waves his arms, 
mutters a little while peering at a big book, a second knave who gets 
you to sign your name in another—think ye this be stuff to engage 
or impress a woman? Use the rights Nature has given you; what 
sayeth Nature? Drown these despicable customs in thy scorn, go 
be a whore to thy desires. Your body is the church where Nature 
asks to be reverenced. Nature sneers at the altar where that sottish 
priest has just brayed his ritual through; the oaths Nature demands 
of you aren’t those you've just repeated to this abject juggler or 
those others you’ve set your name to pursuant to the instructions 
of his aide, that lububrious man over there. What Nature would 
that you swear unto is that you surrender yourself to men, for so 
long ‘and to that extent you have the human strength so to do. The 
god Nature proffers you isn’t that circular chip of dried dough that 
a harlequin has just launched along the way to your bowels; but 
‘tis pleasure she gives you for a divinity, pleasure, sweet joy; and 
tis in neglecting your duties toward that god and your own desires 
that you'll excite the.ire of a mother who would be tender to her 
children. 

“Granted a choice of partner, you'll every time select a 
married person; it being to the advantage of all concerned to keep 
the thing a secret, you’l] have less to fear by way of indiscretion; . 
but preferable even to these individuals are those in your hire. I’ve 
already told you so: they’re beyond comparison the best, you can 
change them like linen; variety, multiplicity are the two most 
powerful vehicles of lust. Fuck with the maximum possible number 
of men; nothing so much amuses, so much heats the brain as pro- 
fusion; no one in this cr>wd will be unable to afford you some new 
pleasure, be it but the pleasure of one conformation or gesture the 
more, and, my child, you know nothing at all if all you are 


Juliette 83 


acquainted with is one prick. Were you to be served by an army, it 
could make no difference to your husband: you'll agree that he 
won't be more dishonored by the thousandth than he was by the 
first, indeed, he’ll be less dishonored, for it does seem that one 
somehow effaces the other. Furthermore, if he is reasonable, the 
husband is always much more prone to excuse libertinage than love; 
the one offends personally, the other assumes the look of a mere 
flaw in your physical make-up. ’Tis altogether possible he have a 
flaw in his, it’s all one; as for you and your principles, either you’re 
no philosopher, or you must necessarily feel that, once the first 
step has been taken, one commits no graver sin as one accomplishes 
the ten thousandth than at the start. Thus, there remains the 
matter of the world at large. Well, the public belongs entirely to 
you. Everything depends upon the art of feigning and the other of 
imposture; if you are skilled in each—and your main task is to 
become so—you'll do absolutely whatever you wish, and to both 
the public and your husband. Never cease to bear in mind that it’s 
not an error that ruins a woman, but the uproar occasioned by it, 
and that ten million crimes that remain unknown are less dangerous 
than the least slip which glares in the eye of everybody. 

“Be modest in your dress: dash and finery do much more to 
exhibit a woman than can her twenty lovers; a more or less elegant 
hair style, a more or less costly gown, none of that furthers happi- 
ness; but frequent, extensive, and intensive fucking works wonders 
therefor. With a prudish or humble air, you'll never be suspected 
of anything; were someone to dare criticize your character, a 
thousand champions will spring to break lances in your defense; 
the public, lacking enough time to pursue its investigations very far, 
never judges save by appearances: it costs hardly anything at all to 
wear those it wants to see. Give it satisfaction and when you need 
it, the public will be on your side. 

“If you have sons, then when they are grown remove 
them from your immediate vicinity: they have only too often 
appeared in the role of betrayers to their mothers. Should they 
tempt you, resist the desire; the discrepancy in age is sure to breed 
a disgust, its victim will be you. There’s nothing very piquant to 
that variety of incest, and it can have a negative influence upon 
much solider delights; frigging yourself with your daughter, if she 


84 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleases you, presents many fewer risks. Include her in your de- 
bauches and she’s less apt to discuss them in public. 

‘And now I think I had better add a word of conclusion to all 
this advice: the self-restraint some women exercise means a loss 
to society, a curse to society; there ought to be a form of punish- 
ment for the absurd, wrongheaded creatures who, for whatever the 
motive, fancy that by preserving their loathsome virginity they are 
acquitting themselves brilliantly in this world and readying them- 
selves for laurels in the next. 

“Youthful, appetizing exemplars of the female sex,” Delbene 
went on panegyrically, “‘ ’tis to you I’ve until now addressed myself, 
"tis to you I say once again: devil take this uncivilized virtuousness 
which fools dare confection into an ornament for you to wear, give 
up the outlandish, the barbaric habit of immolating yourselves upon 
the altars of this grotesque virtue whose pitifully meager rewards 
will never offset the imrnense sacrifices you shall be called upon to 
make in its name. And by what earthly right do men require so much 
self-abnegation in you, when they deny themselves so precious 
little? Do you not plainly see that it’s they who’ve concocted the 
rules and that they were drawn up under the oversight of their 
pride, their insolent pride or their intemperance ? 

“Oh, my companions, I say it unto you: Fuck! you were born 
to fuck. To be fucked Nature created you; let bawl the mad, let 
blither and snivel the jadges, let whine and gripe the hypocrites; 
they have their own rezsons for condemning those delicious heats, 
those joyous frenzies wiich confer all their charm upon your days. 
Unable to wring more from you, envious of all you can give to 
others, they heap discredit upon you and censure because they have 
nothing further themselves to expect and because they are no more 
in a position to ask you for anything; but go consult the children 
of love and of pleasure, go put the question to the whole of that 
society, and myriad voices will answer you in chorus: you will be 
exhorted to fuck, because Nature would that you fuck, and it is a 
crime against Nature not to fuck. Do not be intimidated by that 
empty epithet whore, an idiotic s/ut is she who declines the glory 
of that title. A whore is a lovable creature, young, voluptuous, who, 
less interested in her reputation than in the welfare of others, on 
those grounds alone merits every praise. The whore is the beloved 


Juliette 85 


child of Nature, the abstinent girl is Nature’s execration; the whore 
is deserving of altars, the vestal of the stake. And what more 
potent insult can a girl fling in Nature’s teeth than to waste herself 
by flagrantly keeping, and in defiance of all the injury that may 
thereby result to her own self, an illusory virginity whose entire 
value derives from nothing but the most preposterous, the vilest, 
the meanest of all irrationalities ? Fuck, my friends, fuck, I repeat, 
with effrontery sneer at the counsel of those who aim to make you 
captive in the despotic irons of a virtue whence no conceivable good 
ever has or ever shall come. Forswear them forever, all modesty 
and reserve; make haste to fuck, be quick, there is only one age for 
discharging, take advantage of it. For time flies. If you allow the 
roses to fade, you'll reap a whirlwind of remorse and rue; and the 
day may come when, belatedly possessed of the desire to have a 
petal plucked, you’ll find no lover who wants it—and then, and 
then you'll never forgive yourself for having let go by those 
moments when love would have welcomed your favors. But, do you 
say, such a girl renders herself infamous, and the weight of this 
infamy is insupportably onerous? Can such a trifling objection be 
made in good faith? Let’s be frank then: prejudice is the sole 
author of infamies: how many acts are so qualified by an opinion 
forged out of nought but prejudice! The vices of theft, of sodomy, 
of poltroonery, for example—are these not dubbed infamies? and 
that shan’t prevent you from admitting that, viewed through 
Nature’s optic, they are completely legitimate, and whatever is 
lawful cannot possibly be infamous. For it is impossible that some- 
thing urged by Nature be anything but lawful. Well, without—for 
the time being—subjecting these vices to a searching scrutiny, is it 
not certain that every man has been infused with the idea of 
acquiring wealth? That being so, the means he employs to become 
rich are just as natural as they are lawful. Similarly, are not all 
men given to seeking the greatest amount of delight in their 
pleasure-taking? Well, if sodomy is the unfailing means to this 
acknowledged end, sodomy is no infamy. Finally, does not every- 
one sense a desire to preserve himself, has he not been blessed with 
that instinct? Unto self-preservation poltroonery is one of the 
surest means; hence ’tis no infamy, poltroonery, and whatever may 
be our baseless prejudices concerning any of these three vices, it is 


86 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


clear that not one of them can be regarded as infamous, since all 
three are natural. It is likewise with libertinage as practiced by 
individuals of our sex. Since nothing so well serves Nature, this 
libertinage cannot possibly be infamous. 

“But let’s for a moment suppose that this infamy authentically 
exists: what intelligent woman’s career is going to be hampered 
thereby? What the devil does she care if others consider her in- 
famous? If in fact she is not so viewed by rational eyes, and if it is 
impossible that any infa‘ny exist in the case she is in, she'll laugh 
at the injustice and at the lunacy of her neighbors, she'll cede as 
willingly as ever to Nature’s proddings, and she'll cede to them 
more confidently and more easy in her mind than would someone 
less libertine: for everything thwarts, everything affrights, stays, 
diverts her who trembles lest she lose her good name; while she 
who has already bade her reputation farewell, having nothing 
further to lose, being out of danger and fearlessly surrendering 
herself to whatever she wishes to do, must necessarily be the 
happier. 

‘““We may go farther still. The act whereunto this woman gives 
herself, the habits into which her proclivities lead her, were she 
truly infamous from the standpoint of the rules and regulatioris 
current in the area where she lives, if, I say, this act, whatever it be, 
is so vital to her felicity that she cannot forego it without becoming 
unhappy, then would she not be mad to renounce the intention 
of committing it whatever the risk of covering herself with infamy ? 
For the burden of this imagined infamy will not discomfort her, 
will never affect her so much as not indulging in her favorite sin; 
the former suffering will only be intellectual, capable of registering 
itself only upon certain minds, whereas what she deprives herself 
of is a pleasure accessille to everybody. Thus, as between two 
indispensable evils one must necessarily elect the lesser, the woman 
we are speaking of musi: unarguably brave the charge of infamy, 
and continue to live as she did before, in defiance of idle criticism; 
for, at worst, she’ll lose extremely little by incurring this ill fame, 
while, at best, she’ll lose a great deal by foregoing what will earn 
her a wicked renown. She must therefore accustom herself to 
opprobrium, learn to ourstare it, she must achieve supremacy over 
this puny antagonist, dorninate it, from earliest childhood she must 


Juliette 87 


habituate herself to blushing at nothing, to spurning the modesty, 
to vanquishing the shame which will always wreak havoc with her 
pleasures and add nothing to her happiness. 

“Once having attained this high level of development, she'll 
make an astonishing but nonetheless eminently true discovery: that 
the stings and nettles of this infamy she dreaded have metamor- 
phosed into goads to pleasure, and that, far from wishing to avoid 
these hurts, she’ll wound herself most voluntarily, she’ll redouble 
her efforts to seek out ways to feel a delectable pain, and it shan’t 
be long before she carries things to the point of desiring to broad- 
cast evidence of her turpitude. Observe the ravishing libertine! the 
sublime creature wants to libertinize herself before the whole wide 
world, shame is nought to her, she flouts horror and scandal, her 
single complaint is that to her errors there are not witnesses enough. 
And the remarkable thing is that only now does she truly come to 
know the pleasure which heretofore was wrapped in the anesthetiz- 
ing cloud of her prejudices; that she be transported to the ultimate 
extreme of drunkenness, she had first to destroy every last obstacle 
preventing these needles from penetrating to the agonizing delight 
of her heart. But, sometimes you hear it said, but there are awful 
things, there are things which defy common sense, that con- 
flict with all the seeming laws of Nature, of conscience, of decency, 
things that seem not only properly to arouse a general horror but 
such as to be unable to procure one any pleasure. . . . Surely, in the 
eyes of fools; but there are certain minds, my friends, certain 
spirits which, having rid these things of what makes them in appear- 
ance horrible, and doing so by annihilating the prejudice which 
caused filth and wrong to adhere to them, behold these same things 
as nought but the occasion of mighty joy, and these delights are 
all the keener the greater the gulf between these things and ap- 
proved behavior, the more radically they countercarry every prac- 
tice, and the more sternly they are proscribed by vulgar law. Strive 
to cure such a mind in such a woman: try it, I defy you. By pitching 
her soul to this tone, the throbbing vibrations that assail her become 
so voluptuous and so intense that she is blind to all else save the 
need to march ever onward along the divine path she has chosen. 
The more appalling the thing to be done, the more it pleases her, 
and you'll never hear her complain that she lacks the mettle 


88 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


and the will to endure the brand of infamy—the infamy she 
cherishes and whose terrible heat only further raises the tempera- 
ture of her pleasures. This explains to you why she-devils of this 
breed are forever gone in quest of excess and why they are stung 
by no pleasure save when ’tis spiced with crime; no longer visualiz- 
ing crime as the vulgar do, in whose sight it is repugnant, with 
other eyes they behold another vision, and it is one of infinite 
charm. The habit of stopping at nothing, of overcoming every 
barrier causes them ever and again to find eminently easy and good 
what was formerly forbidding and bad; and, progressing from 
extravagance to extravzgance, they attain at length to monstros- 
ities . . . monstrosities whose execution lies a step ahead of them, 
because these women must perpetrate real crimes to obtain real 
spasms of joy, and beczuse, unfortunately, there is no such thing 
as a real crime, do whzt you will, desire what you please. Thus, 
always mounting in the track of the speeding star, eternally dis- 
tanced by desire, ’tis not that these women perform too few horrors, 
but that there are too few horrors to be performed. Take care not 
to believe, my friends, that the delicacy of our sex somehow serves 
as lee shelter to the wird of wickedness: more sensitive than men, 
we are quicker than they to sense the storm, more eager to heed 
the high cry of wrong. Thus ’tis unimaginable what we do, after 
what excesses we lust, nien have no idea what a woman is capable 
of when Nature goes unchecked, when religion’s voice is throttled, 
when the law’s sway over her is broken. 

“Frequently we hear the passions declaimed against by un- 
thinking orators who forget that these passions supply the spark 
that sets alight the lantern of philosophy; who forget that ’tis to 
impassioned men we cwe the overthrow of all those religious 
idiocies wherewith for so long the world was plagued. "T'was 
nought but the fires of emotion cindered that odious scare, the 
Divinity, in whose name so many throats were cut for so many 
centuries; passion alone dared obliterate those foul altars. Ah, had 
the passions rendered rnan no other service, is this one not great 
enough to make us indulgent toward the passions’ mischievous 
pranks? Oh, my dears, steel yourselves to brave the aspersions 
they'll always be ready to cast upon you, and so as to know how to 
scorn infamy as it must be scorned, familiarize yourselves with all 


Juliette sb 89 


that can attract the charge, multiply your little misdeeds; ’tis 
they that will gradually habituate you to braving come what may ... 
that will crush remorse in you before the seed of remorse can 
germinate. As basis and rule to your conduct adopt that which 
seems in nicest agreement with your penchants; trouble yourselves 
not to inquire whether or no that concurs with our drab conventions, 
for you would be most unfair to your own selves were you, by de- 
priving yourselves, to punish yourselves for not having been born 
in a clime where the thing is applauded. Heed only what most 
flatters or delights you, ’tis this suits you best, all else not at all. 
Be imperturbably indifferent to the style in vices and virtues that’s 
the rage today in town; vice, virtue, the words have no real 
signification, they’re arbitrary, interchangeable, express only what 
is locally and temporarily in vogue here and there. Once again, be 
firm in your conviction that infamy soon transforms itself into 
voluptuousness. I remember having read somewhere, in Tacitus, I 
believe, that infamy is the highest and last of pleasures for those 
who are jaded by the excessive-use they have made of all others; a 
most dangerous pleasure, I believe, since one must find a means, a 
puissant means, for reaping enjoyment from this species of self- 
abandon, from this sort of degradation of sentiment whence every 
other vice is born; since it withers the soul, or rather robs it of 
every atmosphere save the pale of utter corruption, and that with- 
out leaving the tiniest outlet to remorse. Indeed, it absolutely 
extinguishes remorse; better, it works a thoroughgoing change in 
remorse: for now we have a person who has lost all esteem save 
for what gives rise to remorse, and who much amuses himself with 
reviving this feeling in order to relish the pleasure of quashing it, 
and who, step by step, accedes to the most unheard-of excesses ; and 
the ease with which he arrives at these excesses is only increased by 
the number of transgressions he must commit and the quantity of 
virtues he must contemn preparatorily ; and so many obstacles over- 
leapt are so many voluptuous episodes, often more stimulating to a 
perfidious imagination than is the very atrocity he designs. What is 
most wonderful about it all is that he believes himself happy—and 
is. If, reversibly, the virtuous individual is happy too, happiness 
necessarily ceases to be a situation every person can achieve by 
behaving well; happiness is thus proven to depend uniquely upon our 


90 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


individual organization, and may be as readily encountered in the 
triumph of virtue as in the abyss of vice. . .. But what is this I say? 
in the triumph of virtue. ... Ah, has virtue this maddening sting? 
What chill, toughened soul could ever be cheered by virtue’s meager 
rewards? No, my friends, no, virtue shall never make for our 
happiness. He lies who pretends to have found happiness there; he 
seeks to have us call happiness what are rather pride’s illusions. 
For my part, this do I ceclare to you: that with all my soul I de- 
test, I hate virtue, I despise it today as in the past I did cherish it, 
and to the joys I taste in outraging virtue constantly I'd like to add 
the supreme delight of assassinating it in every heart where it has 
an abode. How often, freighted with images, my accursed brain 
waxes hot, so hot that [ want nothing but to be drowned in the 
infamy I’ve just portraved for you! Yes, I’d have it known, in- 
scribed, permanently dezided that I’m a whore; I'd like to for- 
swear, rend this veil, break these disgraceful oaths which prevent 
me from prostituting myself publicly, from soiling myself like the 
lowest of the low. I confess to you that I’m capable of envying the 
fate of those heavenly creatures who ornament street corners and 
slake the filthy lust of whoever strolls by; they squat in vile deg- 
radation, in ordures and horror do they wallow; dishonor is their 
lot, they are insensible to it, to everything . . . what fortune! and 
why should we not labo- thus to become, all of us? In the whole 
world is not the happiest being he in whom there beats a heart 
rock-hardened by passions . . . who has by passion been brought to 
where he is immune to all save pleasure? And what need has he to 
be susceptible of any other sensation? Ah, my friends, were we 
advanced to that degree of turpitude, we'd no longer have the look 
of vileness, and we’d make gods of our errors rather than denigrate 
ourselves! ’Tis thus Nature points out to us all the gate to happi- 
ness: let us go that way. 

“Eh ? Godsfuck! sec, they’re stiff erect,” cried the tempestuous 
Delbéne, ‘‘they’re aloft, resurrected, these divine pricks I’ve been 
palpating while addressing you. Behold, they’re hard as steel, and 
my ass covets them. Cone, good friends, come fuck my ass, this

artificial member. It is a great-sized thing: the cruel Abbess has 
ordered me to don the massiest in the arsenal; and here is a descrip- 
tion of the at once lubricious and ungentle scene that followed: 

Laurette occupies the center of the stage. Motionless, she 
reposes upon a tall stool: beneath her buttocks is a hard cushion, 
her position is horizontal, only her behind is supported. Her 
widely spread legs are so maintained by cords fastened to rings 
sunk in the floor;*her arms, flung over her head and outward, are 
similarly fixed. This attitude places the strait and delicate part of 
the victim’s body in the most admirable situation to be penetrated 
by the glaive. Seated before her is Téléme, who is to hold up her 
pretty head . . . and to’exhort her to patience; and this idea of 
putting her into the confessor’s keeping, quite as if she were about 
to be decapitated, infinitely amuses the cruel Delbéne, whose pas- 
sions, I see, are as ferocious as her tastes appear to be libertine. 
While I depucelate the cunt of this Agnes, Ducroz is to embugger 
me. There is an altar in the room; it stands next to and dominates 
that other altar upon which the little lass is going to be immolated, 
and it will serve as a couch to our voluptuous Abbess. "Tis as she 
reclines there between Volmar and Flavie that the rascal is going 
lewdly to savor both the thought of the crime she is having com- 
mitted and the delicious spectacle of its consummation. 

Before stoppling my ass, Ducroz busies himself readying the 
terrain for the aggression I am about to commit; he moistens the 
borders of Laurette’s vagina and anoints my weapon with an oily 
preparation which enables it to coast in almost at once. However, 
it provokes some truly awesome stretching and tearing: Laurette’s 
not yet ten years old and my lance must be eight inches in its cir- 


92 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


cumference and a dozen long. The encouragement profferred to me, 
the irritated state I am in, the great desire I have to carry out this 
libertine act, everything combines to make me put as much zeal 
into this operation as might the most energetic lover. The engine 
penetrates, but the torrents of blood that leap from the bursting 
hymen, the victim’s lusty screams, all these are indicative that the 
enterprise is not unaccompanied by its perils; the poor little thing’s 
hurt, far from being negligible, consists in a wound of such gravity 
as to make one feel some concern for her life. Ducroz, aware of 
the possibilities, glances toward the Abbess; she, being voluptuously 
frigged by her confederates, nods, and that is the signal to continue. 

‘The bitch is ours!” she cries; ‘“don’t let’s spare her. I am not 
answerable to her, no, nor to anyone, I do as I please!” 

You will readily conceive how these utterances emboldened me. 
Be sure of it, the woe occasioned by my clumsiness and by that 
unwieldy machine only made me ply it in a livelier style: now the 
whole affair is engulfed, Laurette swoons, Ducroz buggers me, 
and Téléme, enchanted, frigs his device upon the fair visage of 
the stricken child whose head he grips between his thighs. . 

‘‘Madame,” says he to Delbéne, the while rubbing his prick, 
“a certain individual here has need of succor— 

‘Tis of fuck she’s in need,” the Abbess retorts, ‘yes, fuck’s 
all the treatment I'll have given the bitch.” 

I continue to grind away, electrified by Ducroz’ prick, it is 
only a quarter of an inch from being entirely engaged in my ass- 
hole; I deal as severely with my victim as I am being dealt with 
myself. Ecstasy overtakes all of us at virtually the same instant. 
The three tribades sprawled on the altar discharge like a battery 
of mortars while along the length of the dildo I’ve buried in 
Laurette my own sperm trickles, while Ducroz fills my anus with 
his, and while Téléme mixes his own with the victim’s tears, for 
he has just ejaculated all over her face. 

Our weariness, the necessity of reviving Laurette if we want 
to extract further pleasure from utilizing her, all this obliges us 
to bestow a little attention upon her. She is unbound; surrounded, 
slapped, pummeled, pinched, fiddled over, Laurette soon shows 
a few signs of life. 

“Well, what’s the matter with you?” Delbéne uncharitably 


Juliette 2 93 


inquires; “are you then such a feeble thing that so mild an attack 
sends you nigh to the doors of hell?” 

‘Alas, Madame, I can bear no more,” protests the poor be- 
draggled little girl whose blood is still flowing copiously; “I’ve been 
sore hurt, I’m going to die—” 

‘Not so fast,” the Superior said laconically, “patients a good 
deal younger than you have successfully weathered these same 
assaults, we'll carry on.” 

And without other precautions being taken than to stanch her 
blood, Laurette is tied anew, and this time she lies upon her belly 
instead of on her back; her asshole comfortably within range, 
Delbéne and her two aides installed upon the altar again, I ready 
myself to attack by another breach. 

Nothing can equal the luxurious manner in which Delbéne 
was having herself masturbated by Volmar and Flavie. The latter, 
stretched out upon Madame Delbene, was giving her cunt to be 
sucked while frigging her mistress’ clitoris and tickling her nipples; 
Volmar, a little farther down, was manipulating the lusty Abbess’ 
asshole, into which she’d dug three of her fingers; every part of 
that slut’s body was being submitted to pleasure, and throughout 
it all her gaze was fixed upon what I was about. She exhorted me 
to get on with the affair. So I presented myself. This time ’tis 
Téleme who’s to embugger me while I am sodomizing Laurette; 
and Ducroz is to prepare this introduction and to frig my clitoris 
at the same time. The difficulties are formidable, they look insur- 
mountable; already two or three times repulsed, my instrument 
either strikes awry or slips astray, despite my guidance, niching 
itself in Laurette’s cunt again, and this accident is not unattended 
by further distress to the unlucky victim of our libertinage. Del- 
bene, losing patience at these delays, bids Ducroz blaze the trail 
by himself embuggering the lass, and, you understand, this com- 
mission is not displeasing to him. Less awesomely proportioned 
that the bowsprit I’m wearing, steadier with a tool that’s more 
securely attached to him than mine is to me, the libertine has 
lodged himself the next instant deep in the maid’s ass; he harpoons 
a virginal turd, fetches it out, is about to enter again and spray fuck 
about the cavity when the Abbess orders him aside and summons 
me to resume operations. 


94 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Sweet Jesus!’ says the Abbot, drawing out his prick all 
glistening with lust and all sullied with dark proof of his victory, 
“ah, doublefucked Jesus, very well. As you say; but I’m bent on 
revenge. Give me Juliette’s ass instead.” 

“No,” says Delbéne who, in spite of the pleasures wherewith 
she is besotting herself, is nonetheless paying keen attention to ours, 
“no, my Juliette’s ass belongs to Téleme, he’s the one who’s to 
enjoy it this time and I'll brook no infringement upon his rights. 
But, you great scoundrel, since you’re so bloody fucking stiff, go 
bury your stave in Volmar’s hungry bum. Eh, do you see the thing? 
Embugger this superb wench here, I tell you, stuff her ass and 
she’ll frig me the merrier.” 

“Godsfuck, yes!’ Volmar exclaims, “come here, mark this 
asshole, get inside, bugzer, be quick about it, I’ve never had 
greater need of a sodomizing.” 

The persons of the drama take their places, the curtain rises 
upon a new act. The breach already blasted in Laurette allows 
my instrument relatively easy access, a minute later and the poor 
little dear feels it lodged deep in her anus. Therewith she re- 
doubles her weeping and wailing, her screams are dreadful; but 
Téleme, having gained <. solid foothold in my ass, and Delbéne, 
swimming in fuck, both give me such lusty encouragement that 
Laurette soon experiences hindwise what not long before I made 
her feel frontwardly: blood streams, and a second time the child 
faints away. "Tis at this point Delbéne’s ferocious character be- 
comes very manifest. 

“Don’t slacken—ge on! go on!” cries she, upon seeing me 
about to retire; “have we discharged yet? We have not! Keep at it 
till then, hear ?”’ 

“But she’s dying,” say I. 

“Dying? Dying? Nonsense, pure histrionics, all a comedy. 
And if ’tis so? Eh then? One whore more or less—do you think 
it matters to me? The bitch is here to entertain us and, by fuck! 
entertain us she shall!” 

My resolve fortified by this Megaera, and not being anyhow 
much inclined to weak-spirited sentiments of commiseration where- 
with Nature did not overly well provide me, I set to work again 
and keep at it until the signal for a legitimate retreat is given by 


Juliette & 95 


the unequivocal evidence of a general pandemonium whose din I 
soon hear coming from all sides; I’ve already had my third emission 
by the time I quit my post. 

“Let’s have a look at all this,” says the Abbess, stepping up 
to Laurette. ‘‘Is the life gone out of her?” 

“Oh, la! She’s no worse off than when the fun began,” Ducroz 
says chidingly, “and if you doubt it, a stout re-encunting from me 
will bring her around in a trice.” 

“Better yet, we'll administer the treatment jointly,” Téleme 
proposes. ‘While I embugger her, Delbéne will frig my asshole 
and I'll mouth Volmar’s; Juliette can likewise socratize Ducroz 
and he’ll put a diligent tongue to Flavie’s cunt.”’ 

Approved, the project is put into execution; and the rapid 
movements of our two fuckers, their impetuous lust, quickly bring 
the sorely beset Laurette back to her senses. 

‘““My best beloved,” I then inquire of the Abbess, whom I 
draw aside, “however shall you repair all the damage that’s just 
been done ?”’ 

“That which you’ve sustained shall be very soon, my angel,” 
Delbéne answered, “tomorrow, I'll massage you with an ointment 
that so wonderfully restores their whole order to things that 
afterward no one would ever guess they’d been exposed to rude 
usage. As for Laurette—have you forgotten that ‘tis generally 
believed she fled the convent? She’s ours, Juliette. She'll not re- 
appear in the world.” 

“What are you going to do with her?” I wondered, much 
mystified. 

‘Make her the victim of our lewdness. Dear Juliette! you are 
yet so very much a novice. Do you still not understand that the 
only serious ones are the criminal excesses? and that the more 
horror one enwraps pleasure in, the more charming pleasure 
becomes ?” 

“Truthfully, my dear, I can make nothing of what you say—” 

“Have patience then. You shan’t have long to wait ere all 
comes clear. But now, let’s have some supper.” 

The company removes to a little room adjacent to the salon 
where the orgies have been celebrated. Here, spread upon tables, 
is a profusion of dainties, the rzrest delicacies in meat, wine of 


96 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the very best. We take our places . .. Laurette serves us! I soon 
remarked, from the manner the group adopted with her, by the 
harsh tone in which she was addressed, that the poor little wretch 
was considered nothing more than a victim whose doom was already 
sealed. The merrier spirits grew, the worse she was treated; 
there was nothing our youthful waitress did that wasn’t rewarded 
by a pinch or a tweak, a slap or a blow; and if she was remiss, 
however slightly inattentive to instructions, she was often more 
severely punished yet. I'll not linger, kind reader, over the doings 
and utterances which distinguished that lavish bacchanal; be con- 
tent to know that, for horror, for foulness, they equaled the worst 
I’ve since seen by way of the utmost in libertinage. 

Down there, the air was very warm, we women were nude; 
the men were in the same disorder and, mixed in amidst us, were 
with complete unrestraint giving themselves over to whatever of 
the filthiest and most crz.pulous their delirium could egg them into 
undertaking. Wrangling over my ass, Téléme and Ducroz looked 
about to come to blows in their efforts to obtain its use; supine 
beneath the pair of them, I was quietly awaiting the contest’s out- 
come when Volmar, drunk already and in her drunkenness more 
lovely than Venus, seized the two pricks and started to frig 
them into a bowl of punch, all this, she explained, because she 
wanted fuck to drink. 

“‘Let’s have an end to this,” said the Abbess, almost as light- 
headed as the others about her, for wine had been flowing very 
freely, ‘I’m against it unless Juliette agrees to piss into the 
mixture—” 

I piss; the tureen goes from hand to hand, the whores all 
drink their fill, the men do the same and, the riot being at its 
apogee, the extravagant Abbess, at a loss what to invent next to 
reawaken desires her Jibertinage has foundered in exhaustion, 
announces that she warits to go to the vault where the mortal 
remains of the women of the house repose, that she wants to find 
the coffin of one of those her jealous rage brought lately to destruc- 
tion, that she wants to have herself given five or six thumping 
fuckings upon her victirr’s corpse. The idea stirs the company; we 
get to our feet, we locate the spot, candles are set upon the coffins 
ranged round that of the young novice whom three months pre- 


Juliette 2 97 


viously Delbéene had poisoned, after having idolized her. The 
infernal creature lies down upon that sepulcher and, baring her 
cunt to the two ecclesiastics, she challenges first the one, then the 
other. Ducroz is the first to ensocket his spar. We were all specta- 
tors and our sole employment, throughout this gruesome scene, 
was to kiss and fondle her, finger her clitoris and submit ourselves 
to be handled by her. Delirious, Delbéne was battening avidly upon 
these horrors when a dreadful shrill screech was heard, all the 
candles snuffing out that very instant. 

‘““My God, what is this!” cried the intrepid Abbess, alone 
among us all to preserve her courage in the midst of tumult and 
affright. ‘Juliette! Flavie! Volmar!” 

But we’re all deaf, struck dumb, no one gives her answer; 
and were it not for the details our Superior supplied us on the 
morrow, I, who half-swooned away when it happened, would 
probably still know nothing of what brought this fracas about. 
A wood owl hidden in those underground places was the catise 
of it all; startled by the light to which its eyes were unaccustomed, 
it had taken flight and its beating wings created a draft that had 
blown the candles out. When I recovered my wits I found myself 
in my bed and Delbéne, who came to visit me as soon as she learned 
I was better, told me that after she’d calmed the two men, who’d 
been nearly as terrified as we, it was with their aid she had trans- 
ported us to our cells. 

“In supernatural occurrences I have no belief at all,’’ Delbéne 
asserted. ‘Never is there an effect without its cause and my first 
concern, whenever surprised by some effect, is to trace out its 
cause without delay. I promptly located that of our adventure the 
other night; the candles lit once again, we, the men and I, just as 
promptly restored everything to order.” 

“And Laurette, Madame ?” 

“Laurette ? She’s in the cellars, my sweet. We left her there—” 

‘What! Then you—” 

“Not yet. It will be our first piece of business the next time 
we assemble. She underwent yesterday’s experience more success- 
fully than one might have thought.” 

“Oh, indeed, Delbéne, you're a very debauched thing. . . 
a cruel thing—”’ 


98 - THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Now, now, not at all. It’s simply that I’ve got very exigent 
passions, and that I heed nothing else. And, persuaded as I am 
that they are the most faithful interpreters of Nature’s will, I 
heed whatever counsel they give me, and do so with as little 
fear as remorse or regret But you look to be whole again, Juliette; 
get up, my darling, come dine with me in my apartment, we'll chat 
together.” 

Later, when we had finished our meal, Delbéne asked me to 
settle myself in a chair beside her. “You are surprised to find me 
so calm in the midst of crime ? Let me then say a few words apropos. 
I fain would have you become as apathetic as I—and I think you 
soon shall. I noticed yesterday that you were struck, even startled, 
by my equanimity in the thick of the horrors we were committing 
and I seem to remember that you accused me of lacking pity for 
that poor Laurette our debauchery sacrificed. 

-“Oh, Juliette, banish all doubt thereof: Nature has arranged 
everything, informed everything, hers is the responsibility for all 
you see and all there is. Flas she given equal strength, equal beauty, 
equal grace to all the creatures wrought by her hand? Of course 
not. Since she desires that each particular thing or constitution 
have its particular contour or hue, so also she wills that fates and 
fortunes be not alike. Th2 luckless ones chance puts in our clutches, 
or who excite our passions, have their place in Nature’s scheme as 
do the stars in the firmament and the sun that gives us light; and 
*tis as certain an evil cne commits in meddling with this wise 
economy as ’twould be were one to confound cosmic operations, 
were that crime within the scope of our possibilities. . . .” 

“But,” I interrupted, ‘were you in distress, Delbéne, would 
you not yearn for succor and kindness ?” 

“I? I'd know how to suffer uncomplainingly,” the stoical 
thinker gave me answer, “‘and I’d implore the aid of no one. 

“If indeed I am Nature’s favorite, if I have no misery to 
dread, have I still not fever and pestilence and war and famine and 
the disruptions of an unfcreseen revolution and all the other plagues 
that blight mankind and mankind’s ease, do not these threaten me 
too? Well, let them all xccur, come what may, I'll bear it daunt- 
lessly. Believe me, Juliette, oh yes, be firmly persuaded that when 
I consent to let others suffer and when I refrain from interfering 


Juliette & 99 


with their sufferings, it is because I myself have learned to suffer, 
to endure suffering, and alone. Resistance is foolhardy and fruitless; 
so let’s abandon ourselves to Nature’s keeping, that is to say, 
to our fate; it’s not to a career of mercifulness Nature appoints 
us; her voice cries to us only this, that it is for us to develop the 
strength necessary to withstand the trials she holds in store for us. 
And commiseration, far from steeling our soul for what is to 
come, shakes it, unreadies it, softens it, definitively robs it of the 
courage that is no longer there when, later, it needs courage to cope 
with its own afflictions. He who learns how to be insensible to the 
ills that besiege others soon becomes impassive in the face of his 
own woes, and it is far more necessary to know oneself how to 
suffer than to accustom oneself to shedding tears in others’ behalf. 
Oh, Juliette, the less one is sensitive, the less one is affected, and 
the nearer one draws to veritable autonomy; we are never prey 
save to two things: the evil which befalls others, or that which 
befalls us: toughen ourselves in the face of the first, and the 
second will touch us no more, and from then on nothing will have 
the power to disturb our peace.” 

“Yet,” I pointed out, “the inevitable consequence of this 
apathy will be crimes.” 

“And so? ’tis neither to crime nor to its virtuous contrary 
we ought to become especially attached, but rather to whatever 
renders us happy; and were I to discover that my only possibility 
of happiness lay in excessive perpetration of the most atrocious 
crimes, without a qualm I’d enact every last one of them this very 
instant, certain, as I have already told you, that the foremost of 
the laws Nature decrees to me is to enjoy myself, no matter at 
whose expense. If Nature has constituted my intimate structure 
in such a way that it is only from the infelicity of my fellows that 
voluptuous sensations can flower in me, then ’tis so because Nature 
would have me participate in the destruction she desires—and she 
desires destruction, an end quite as essential to her as any other 
aim; if she made me wicked, ’twas because she has pressing need 
of wickedness and of beings like re to serve her policy.” 

‘Arguments of that kind can lead far... .” 

“And one should keep in step with them,” Delbéne rejoined. 
“Take them as far as you like and I defy you to show me the point 


100 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


at which they become dangerous; one has enjoyed oneself the whole 
way along the journey, and that’s all, one cannot ask for more.” 

‘May one take enjoyment at the expense of others?” 

“The thing that interests me least in this world is what happens 
to others; I haven’t the slightest germ of belief in that 
bond of fraternity I hear fools prate about unendingly, and it’s 
not without having closely analyzed these ties of brotherhood that 
I reject the lot of them.” 

‘What! do you doubt this, the most primary of Nature’s 
laws?” 

“Listen to me, Juliette .. . oh, truly, ’tis astounding the need 
this girl has of instruction... of guidance. .. .” 

We were at this stz.ge in our conversation when a lackey, sent 
by my mother, arrived to inform Madame the Abbess of the dread- 
ful state of affairs at ou: home and the grave illness of my father; 
my sister and I were requested to return at once. 

“Great heavens!’’ exclaimed Madame Delbéne. “But I’ve 
entirely forgotten your maidenhead, which needs repair. One 
instant, my angel, here, this jar contains an extract of myrtle, rub 
yourself with it in the rnorning and before retiring at night, nine 
days of that ought to saffice. On the tenth you'll find yourself as 
much a virgin as you were emerging from the womb of your 
mother.” 

Then, sending someone in search of Justine, she entrusted 
us both to the servant who'd come to fetch us away, and she be- 
sought us to return as soon as we could. We embraced her, and left. 

My father died. You know what disasters ensued upon his 
passing :-my mother’s death a month later, and the destitution and 
abandonment we found ourselves in. Justine, who knew nothing 
of my secret liaisons with the Abbess, knew nothing either of the 
visit I paid her several days after our ruin, and as the behavior 
and sentiments she then exhibited reveal what remained to be 
discovered of this original woman’s character, it were well, my 
friends, that I recount that interview. Delbéne was short with me 
that day. She began by refusing to open the gate to me, and only 
consented to talk for a moment through the grillwork dividing us. 

When, surprised by this chilly reception, I reminded her of 
our at least carnal attachments, she said: 


Juliette 2% 101 


“My child, all that grubby nonsense is over and done with 
when two persons cease to dwell together; so my advice to you is 
to forget it. For my part, I must assure you that I cannot recall 
a single one of the facts and circumstances you allude to. As for 
the indigence threatening you, recollect the fate of Euphrosine: 
she didn’t even wait to be beckoned by necessity, but of her free 
will leaped into a career of libertinage. Since now you have no 
choice, imitate her. There’s nothing else for you to do. I therefore 
confine my suggestions to that one; but once you’ve made the 
choice, refrain from calling upon me: the role may, after all, not 
suit you, may not bring you success, you might need money, credit, 
and I shall not be able to supply you the one or the other.” 

So saying, Delbene turned on her heel and walked away, 
leaving me in a state of bewilderment . . . a state which, of course, 
would have been less distressing had I been more philosophical ; 
my meditations were cruel... .. 

I left immediately, firmly resolved to follow the wicked 
creature’s advice, perilous though it was. Luckily, I remembered 
the name and address of the woman Euphrosine had mentioned to 
us long ago, at a time when, alas! I never dreamed I would some- 
day have to avail myself of her: an hour later I stood at her door. 

Madame Duvergier gave me a heart-warming welcome. Her 
connoisseur’s eye deceived by the wonder Delbéne’s most excellent 
remedy had wrought, Duvergier came to a conclusion that was 
to allow her to deceive many another. "T'was two or three days 
before assuming a post in this house that I took leave of my sister 
in order to pursue a calling very different from the one she elected. 

After the reverses I had sustained, my existence depended 
solely upon my new hostess, I confided myself entirely into her 
hands and accepted the conditions she imposed; but no sooner was 
I alone and given opportunity to ponder events than I began to 
dwell anew upon Madame Delbéne’s desertion of me and upon 
her ingratitude. Alas! said I to myself, why did her heart harden 
before my misfortune? Juliette poor, Juliette rich—are these two 
different creatures? What then is this curious capriciousness that 
leads one to love opulence and fly from misery? Ah, I was still to 
comprehend that poverty must necessarily be distasteful, abhorrent 
to wealth, at the time I was still unaware of how much prosperity 


102 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


dreads misery, of how it loathes misery, I was still to learn that 
from this fear of relieving suffering results prosperity’s hatred for 
it. But, I went on to wonder, but how can it be that this libertine 
woman—this criminal, how is it that she does not fear the indis- 
cretion of those whom she treats so cavalierly ?—further childish- 
ness on my part; I as yet knew nothing of the insolence and the 
effrontery that characterize vice when seated upon foundations 
of wealth and reputation. Madame Delbene was the Mother 
Superior of one of the most renowned convents in the Ile de France, 
her annuities came to sixty thousand pounds, she had the most 
powerful friends at the Court, no one in the City was more admired: 
how she must have detested a poor girl like me who, orphaned 
and without a penny to her name, to oppose her injustices could only 
submit appeals which would soon be dismissed with a laugh if ever 
they were heard or which, more probably, would be immediately 
branded as calumnies and could well earn the plaintiff impudent 
enough to demand her rights the indefinite loss of her liberty. 
Astonishingly corrupted already, this striking example of 
injustice, even though ‘twas I who had to suffer from it, pleased 
rather than redirected me into better ways. So then! said I to 
myself, I have but to strive after wealth too; rich, I'll soon be as 
impudent as that woma., I'll enjoy the same rights and the same 
pleasures. Let’s beware of virtuousness, ’tis sure disaster; for vice 
is victorious always andl everywhere; poverty’s to be avoided at 
all costs, since it’s the odject of a universal scorn. . . . But, having 
nothing, how am I to elude misfortune? By criminal deeds, ob- 
viously. Crime? What’s that to me? Madame Delbéne’s teachings 
have already rotted my heart and infected my brain; I see evil in 
no action, I am convinced that crime as nicely serves Nature’s ends 
as can goodness and decency; so let’s be off into this perverse world 
where success is the one mark of triumph; let no obstacle check us, 
no scruple hinder us, for misery is his who.tarries by the way- 
side. Since society is composed exclusively of dupes and scoundrels, 
let’s decidedly play the latter: it’s thirty times more flattering to 
one’s amour-propre to gull others than to be made a gull oneself. 
Fortified by these reflections—which may perhaps strike you 
as somewhat precocious at the age of fifteen, but which, granted 
the education I had had, will surely not seem unlikely to you—I 


Juliette & 103 


set myself to waiting resignedly for whatever Providence might 
bring me, fully determined to exploit every opportunity to better 
my fortune at no matter what price to myself or to others. 

To be sure, I had a rigorous apprenticeship to undergo; these 
often painful first steps were to complete the corruption of my 
morals and rather than alarm yours, my friends, it would perhaps 
be better were I to withhold details which, if laid out realistically, 
would only dazzle your eyes, for my performances were in all 
probability rather more wonderfully wicked than those you your- 
selves accomplish every day— 


‘Madame, I protest, that I am not entirely able to believe,” 
the Marquis broke in. ‘‘Knowing of us what you do, I declare, 
Madame, I declare that I am dumbfounded that you allow yourself 
for one single instant to harbor such a fear. Our performances, 
our behavior—”’ 

“Forgive me,” said Madame la Comtesse de Lorsange, ‘“‘but 
it is here a question of corruption manifest in both sexes—” 

“Madame, Madame, say on—” 

“for Duvergier catered indiscriminately to the fancies of 
men and of women—”’ 

“Indeed,” said the Marquis, ‘‘you cannot have intended to 
deprive us of descriptions which for being heteroclite and com- 
posite would only entertain us the more? We are acquainted with 
virtually all the extravagances whereof individuals of our sex are 
capable, and you can but delight us by instructing us in all those 
which individuals of yours are prone to essay.” 

“So be it,” rejoined Madame la Comtesse. ‘‘I’ll nevertheless 
be careful to detail only the most unusual debauches and, to avoid 
monotony, I'll omit any that strike me as too simple, too banal.” 

“Marvelous,” said the Marquis, showing the company an 
already lust-swollen engine; “‘but are you bearing in mind the 
effect these narrations may produce in us? Behold the condition 
brought about by the mere promise of what is to come.” 

“Well, my friend,” the charming Comtesse said, “am I not 
completely at your disposition? [’ll reap a twofold pleasure from 
my pains; and as self-esteem is always of much account with 


104 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


women, you'll permit me to suppose that, regarding the general 
rise in temperature about to take place, while my speeches may 
be one cause therefor, my person shall also share in the respon- 
sibility ?”” 

“But you are quite right, I must convince you this very 
instant,” the Marquis said. Very moved indeed, he drew Juliette 
into an adjoining chamber; there they remained long enough to 
taste gluttonously all the sweetest joys of unbridled lewdness. 

“For my part,” sz.id the Chevalier, whom the departure of 
the others had left encloseted with Justine, “I must confess I’m 
not yet stiff enough to have to lighten ballast, not yet. Never mind, 
come hither, my child, kneel down, there’s a good little girl, and 
suck me; but pray so co as to show me a lot more of your ass 
than of your cunt. ’Tis good, ’tis very good,” he said, seeing Justine, 
more than adequately trained in these turpitudes, grasp, most skill- 
fully, howbeit with regret, the spirit of this one, ‘oh, yes, yes, she 
does it suitably enough.” 

And the Chevalier, singularly well sucked, all sighs and 
gladness, was perhaps about to abandon himself to the gentle, 
honey-sweet sensations of a thus provoked discharge when the 
Marquis, returning with Juliette, besought her to take up the 
thread of her story again, and his confrere, if he could, to postpone 
until some later moment the crisis toward which the drama ap- 
peared to be hastening. 

Quiet being restored and attentions fixed again upon Madame 
de Lorsange, she resumed her tale, and spoke as follows : 


Madame Duvergier had but six women aboard; but these 
were seconded by reinforcements numbering three hundred, all 
at her beck and call; two strapping lackeys five feet and eight 
inches tall, membered each like Hercules, and two little grooms 
of fourteen and fifteen, heavenly to see, were likewise furnished 
to libertines who wanted a mixture of sexes or who preferred 
antiphysical antics to the enjoyment of women; and in cases where 
those limited masculine effectives would not have sufficed, Duvergier 
could increase them by drawing upon a reserve corps of over 
eighty individuals who were domiciled outside the house, all of 


Juliette & 105 | 


them ready, at any hour, to present themselves anywhere their — 
services were required. 

Madame Duvergier’s house was cunning, it was delightful. 
Situated between courtyard and garden, and having two exits, 
one on either side, rendezvous took place there under conditions 
of secrecy which no other arrangements could have afforded; 
within, the furnishings were magnificent, the boudoirs voluptuous, 
lavishly decorated; the cook in the establishment was a master in 
his art, the wines were of quality, and the girls were charming. The 
use of these outstanding facilities was not to be had for nothing. 
And, indeed, nothing in Paris cost anything like what one paid for 
an evening’s rout in these divine surroundings; Duvergier never 
asked less than ten Jouts for the simplest kind of téte-a-téte. With- 
out morals and without religion, enjoying the wholehearted and 
unfailing support of the police, panderess to the greatest lords of 
the realm, Madame Duvergier, having nothing and no one under 
the sun to fear, created new fashions, made new discoveries, spe- 
cialized in things which none of her calling had ever attempted 
anywhere, things which would make tremble both Nature and 
mankind. 

For six weeks in a row, that adroit rascal sold my maidenhead 
to above fifty buyers and, every evening, employing a pomade 
in many respects similar to Madame Delbéne’s, she scrupulously 
effaced the ravages wrought pitilessly all day long by the intemper- 
ance of those to whom her greed delivered me up. As those de- 
virginizers without exception had a heavy hand and usually a beef’s 
wit to match a beef’s pizzle, I’ll spare you a good many tedious 
particulars, pausing only to give you an account of the Duc de 
Stern, whose manic eccentricity I consider downright unusual. 

The simplest apparel conformed best with the requirements 
of this libertine’s lubricity; I went to him got up as a little street 
girl. After traversing numerous sumptuous apartments I reached 
a mirrored room where the Duc was waiting for me, his man- 
servant at his side, a tall young man of eighteen he was, handsome 
as they come and with the most interesting face, Thoroughly 
coached in the role I was expected to play, I was taken aback by 
none of the questions the lewd clog posed me. I stood before him; 


106 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


he was seated on a sofa and was frigging his valet’s prick. The 
Duc spoke to me in this wise : 

“Is it true,” he demanded, “that you are in the most direly 
necessitous circumstances, and that in coming here your sole pur- 
pose and one hope is tc earn means indispensable simply to keep 
body and soul together ?”” 

‘Aye, Sire, and the truth is that for three days neither I nor 
my mother has tasted bread.” 

“Ho! Excellent then!” said the Duc, taking his man’s hand 
to be himself frigged. ‘‘The thing is of importance, I’m hugely 
pleased that matters stand thus with you. And ’tis your mother 
who sells you ?” 

“Yes, alas!” 

“Splendid! Eh... and have you any sisters ?” 

“One, my Lord.” 

‘*And how is it she’s not been sent to me?” 

‘Sire, she has left home, misery made her flee. We don’t know 
what has become of her.” 

“Eh, fuck my eyes! It’s got to be found, that! Where do you 
suppose she could be? Whiat’s her age ?” 

“Thirteen.” 

“Thirteen! Appalliag, appalling—knowing my tastes as by 
God they must by now, why do they keep this creature back from 
me?” 

“But no one knows where she is, Sire.” 

“Thirteen! Appalling. Well, I’ll locate her, I'll find her some- 
how. Lubin, hey there, off with her clothes, let’s to the verification.” 

And while this order is being carried out, the Duc, continuing 
the work begun by his ‘sanymede, sets complacently to rattling 
at a dark, flabby little device, so small it’s barely to be seen. As 
soon as I am naked, Lubin examines me with extremest diligence 
and then declares to his master that everything is in the very best 
condition. 

“Show me the other side,” the Duc says. 

And Lubin, bending me down over a couch, spreads my thighs 
and, whether or not convinced himself of the inexecution of any 
previous assault, is, in view of the admirable repair it is in, able to 


Juliette % 107 


assure the Duc that no evidence warrants belief that anything grave 
has befallen me in this sector hitherto. 

“And in the other?” murmurs Stern, drawing my buttocks | 
apart and testing my asshole with a finger. 

“No, my Lord, surely not.” 

“Tis well,” says the lecherous nobleman, taking me in his 
arms and sitting me upon one of his thighs; ‘‘but you see, my 
child, don’t you, that I’m incapable of doing the job myself? 
Touch that prick .. . soft, eh? as limp as a rag, no? If you were 
Venus herself you'd not manage to get it any harder. And now 
kindly consider this awful article of weaponry,” he went on, having 
me take hold of his manservant’s resplendent prick. ‘“This matchless 
member here will depucelate you much better than mine ever could. 
You do agree, do you not? Then take your stance, I'll be your pimp. 
Unable to do anyone any harm myself, I adore having others do 
it in my stead. The idea comforts me—” 

“Oh, Sire!” said I, terrified by the inordinate proportions of 
the prick flourished at me. “Oh, Sire, this monster will make a 
shambles of me, I'll not be able to endure its attacks!” 

I sought to break away, to dodge, to protect myself; but the 
Duc de Stern would have none of it. 

“Come, come, no shilly-shallying there, what I like is com- 
pliance in little girls, they who lack it in their conduct with me don’t 
remain long in my good graces. . . . Come nearer. . . . Before 
anything else I'd like to have you kiss my Lubin’s ass.” 

And presenting it to me: 

““A handsome ass, no? Kiss it, then.” 

I obey. 

“And a kiss for that goad he’s got upstanding on this other 
side ? Kiss his prick.” 

Again I obey. 

‘“Now, make ready... lie thus... .’ 

He holds me, his valet moves up and into the operation puts 
such address and vigor that, with three mighty heaves, he sinks his 
massive engine to the bottom of my womb. A terrible scream bursts 
from my throat; the Duc, who has me pinioned and who is frig- 
ging my asshole throughout it all, is feeding avidly upon my sighs 
and tears; the muscular Lubin, master of me, no longer requires 


’ 


108 < THE MARQU:S DE SADE 


his own master’s assistance, so that now the Duc is able to go 
round behind my lover and to embugger him while he depucelates 
me. Those blows his patron is delivering to his posterior soon, 
I notice, contribute to augmenting the force of the blows the valet 
is delivering to me; I was about to collapse beneath the sheer weight 
of their coordinated attacks when Lubin’s discharge saved the 
day for me. 

“Godsfuck!”” cried the Duc who, himself, was not yet done, 
“you're driving too fas: today, Lubin, what ails you? Why must 
fucking a cunt make you lose your head every time?” 

And this event having disordered the plan of the Duc’s at- 
tacks, he fetched out that mischievous little prick which, furious at 
having been displaced, seemed only to be looking for an altar 
whereupon to vent its sordid rage. 

‘Hither, young girl,” commanded the Duc, depositing his 
mean tool in my hands, ‘‘and you, Lubin, lay yourself belly down 
upon that sofa. You, you silly little goose,” he said to me, “plant 
this angry machine in the aperture whence it’s just been ejected, 
then, camp yourself behind me while I’m at work, you'll facilitate 
the task by inserting tw or three fingers in my bum.” 

Everything the lecker desires is promptly done; the operation 
terminates, and the whimsical libertine pays thirty louis for the 
hire of parts the mint condition of which he never once had any 
doubt of. 

Back in the house, Fatima, that one of my companions I was 
fondest of, sixteen years old and lovely as the day, laughed mer- 
rily when I related my <z.dventure. She had had the same one but, 
more fortunate than I, had profited from it to the tune of the fifty 
louis that had been in the purse she'd stolen from off the mantel. 

“What?” I said, “you permit yourself such things?” 

“Regularly or, rather, every chance I get, my dear,” was Fa- 
tima’s reply, ‘‘and altogether without hesitation or scruple, believe 
me. Those rascals are rich: and to whom if not to us is their money 
destined? and why should we be so stupid as not to take it when- 
ever we can? Are you still so lost in the woods of ignorance that 
you suspect there is anything wrong in theft?” 

“T do definitely think it is very wrong.” 

‘Why, that’s an odcl notion, it is,” Fatima assured me, “‘and a 


Jultette & 109 


very misplaced one, granted your trade. It shan’t take me long to 
disabuse you. Tomorrow I dine with my lover in the country, I'll 
ask Madame Duvergier’s leave to include you in the party and 
you'll hear Dorval’s reasoned arguments on the subject.” 

“Bitch!” I exclaimed. “You’re going to corrupt what little 
in me is not yet attainted—oh, as things now are I am only too 
well disposed toward all those horrors. . . . Very well, tis agreed. 
Never fear, either, you'll have an excellent pupil in me. But will 
Duvergier let me go?” 

“Nor have you anything to fear,” said Fatima. “Leave it all 
to me.” 

Early the next morning there comes a carriage to fetch us, we 
drive to La Villette. The house we enter is secluded, but its appear- 
ance is not unseemly. A valet greets us and, having shown us into 
a very well-furnished apartment, he retires and dismisses our car- 
riage; twas then Fatima began to make things clear. 

“Do you know where we are ?”’ she asked, smiling. 

“T have no idea.” 

“In the house of an exceedingly unusual man,”’ my companion 
afirmed. “I lied when I told you that he’s my lover; I’ve been here 
often—but on business. Of it, and of what I earn, Duvergier knows 
nothing; my pay is thus my own. But the work is not without its 

‘risky elements—”’ 

“What do you mean?” I demanded. “You've aroused my... 
curiosity.” 

“This,” said Fatima, “‘is the house of one of the most accom- 
plished thieves in all Paris; the gentleman steals for his living— 
and from stealing derives his keenest pleasures. He'll explain it all 
to you, he'll outline his philosophy for your benefit—he’ll even 
convert you to practicing what he preaches. Completely indifferent 
to women before he’s done his day’s work, it’s only after he’s 
rebbed that he comes alive, only then are his lusts aroused hotly; 
and as he would have the image of his favorite passion reflected 
in everything that accompanies it, it is only when once we've stolen 
that he'll accept our favors—and, furthermore, he'll try to steal 
them from us; it’s a subtle game, you'll understand it perfectly, 
however. It will seem as if we've gained nothing for our trouble . . . 
mind you, I’ve already been paid for this in advance. Here’s the 


110 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


proof: ten louis. They’re for you. I’ve kept an equivalent sum for 
myself.” 

‘And Duvergier ?” 

“But I told you: she’s not in the game. I swindle our beloved 
mother—am I so wrong to do so?” 

‘“‘No, I dare say you’re not,” I agreed. ‘Whatever we earn 
here belongs to us, none of that damnable dividing the booty, 
which, God knows, drives me wild. But go on, at least explain the 
thing tome. Whom are we going to rob, and how?” 

‘‘Listen,”” my companion said. “Spies, and he has a swarm of 
them posted everywhere throughout Paris, inform him of the 
arrival of foreigners ard simpletons who land by the hundred in 
the city; he makes their acquaintance, he gives them dinners with 
women of our category who filch their purses while satisfying their 
needs; all the loot is turned over to him and, whatever be the 
nature of the article stolen, the women obtain a fourth part of its 
value, this being in adcition to anything they have been paid by 
the clients.” 

“But,” said I, ‘‘are there not dangers entailed? How is it the 
fellow hasn’t been arrested ?” 

‘He would have been ages ago had he not taken measures to 
prevent any such inconvenience. Be sure of it, no danger threatens 
him.” 

‘And his house ?” 

‘Houses, rather. He has thirty of them. We're in this one 
today; he sets foot in it once every six months, perhaps only once 
a year. Act your part intelligently; two or three foreigners are to 
come to dinner; after the meal’s over, we'll entertain these gentle- 
men in separate chambers. Be nimble, get the purse of yours, I 
promise you that with mine I’ll not miss the mark. Hidden, Dorval 
will be watching us. The trick done, the dupes will be put to sleep 
by a potion slipped into their drink; we’ll spend the remainder of 
the evening with the master of the house who, shortly after we’ve 
left, will leave also, go somewhere else and repeat the same in- 
famies with other women. And our precious idiots, when tomor- 
row they wake up, they’ll be only too happy to have got away with 
whole skins.”’ 


Juliette & 111 


“Since we've been paid in advance,” I asked Fatima, ‘‘why 
need we go through with the bargain?” 

“Tt would be a miscalculation not to: he’d be finished with us; 
whereas, if we serve him well, he’s likely to have us in twelve or 
fifteen times a year. And, what’s more, following your suggestion, 
wouldn’t we deprive ourselves of all we may earn from robbing 
these cretins?”’ 

‘Right you are. For, had you omitted the first part of -your 
argument, J’d perhaps have reminded you that we can do our own 
stealing without him, and that it’s not to our advantage to sur- 
render three-quarters of what we filch.” 

‘Tend though I still do to abide by mine, I very much admire 
your way of reasoning which,” said Fatima, “demonstrates that you 
are equipped with those very dispositions required for success in 
our calling.” 

Scarcely had we ended our discussion than Dorval entered. 
He was a man of forty years, his face was extremely fair to look 
upon, his air and demeanor gave me the impression of a clever and 
amiable person; above all, he was endowed with the gift of seduc- 
tiveness, of such great importance in a profession like his. 

“Fatima,” speaking to my companion, casting an engaging 
smile at me, ‘‘I suppose you’ ve instructed this pretty young thing in 
the nature of our combined undertaking? Then I have but to tell 
you that we’re soon going to receive two elderly Germans, our 
guests for tonight. They’ve been a month in Paris and are burning 
to meet some attractive girls. One of the two has on him diamonds 
worth some twenty thousand crowns; Fatima, I recommend him to 
you. The other seems to wish to buy a property in this village. I’ve 
assured him I can procure him a fine one at a very low price pro- 
vided he’s willing to pay cash; he ought therefore to have over 
forty thousand francs in his pocket, whether in specie or in letters 
of credit; Juliette, I leave him to you. Show an aptitude for the 
task and I'll seek your collaboration in the future, and often.” 

‘What! For shame, Sir,” I said, “can such horrors arouse you 
sensually ?” 

“Charming girl,” replied Dorval, “I see that you know noth- 
ing of this matter: of, I mean to say, the shock imparted by criminal 
impressions to the nervous system. You require enlightenment upon 


112 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


these lubricious phenomena, we'll supply it in due time; until then 
we've other things to occupy us. Let’s pass into this room, our 
Germans are about to appear, kindly remember to employ all your 
skill at seducing them, at . . . undertaking them; that’s all I ask 
of you, upon that everything shall depend.” 

We entered. Scheffier, the swain who was to be mine, was an 
authentic baron of forty-five, authentically ugly, authentically be- 
pimpled, and authentically stupid as, insofar as I can determine, 
every authentic Germar. is if one excepts the illustrious Gessner. 
The goose my friend was to pluck was called Conrad; he was 
indeed covered with diarnonds; his mind, his figure, his face, and his 
age rendered him almost identical to his compatriot, and his sheer 
witlessness, as imposing as Scheffner’s, guaranteed Fatima a success 
no less easy nor any less complete than, by every indication, mine 
was to be. 

The conversation, general at the outset, and dull enough, 
swiftly became very particular. Fatima was not only pretty, she was 
amusing; she soon had poor Conrad befuddled and spellbound; 
while my air of shy innocence soon brought Scheffner squarely under 
my thumb. Dinner came on. Dorval saw to it that his guests’ glasses 
were filled and often replenished with the most delicious wines, and 
we were scarcely midway through dessert when both our Teutonic 
friends were giving plain evidence of an extreme desire to converse 
with us in private. 

Dorval, wishing to oversee each of these operations, there- 
fore did not wish them to transpire simultaneously; declaring that 
there was but one boudoir, as best he could he calmed Conrad, 
chafing dreadfully at the bit, and had me lead Scheffner away and 
into action. His enthusiasm was unbounded, that good German had 
an insatiable desire for caresses. It was warm in the boudoir, I 
invited him to remove his clothes, I removed mine in order to 
inflame him further; and placing his discarded garments within 
reach of my rrght hand, while the dear Baron fucked me, while, the 
better to beguile him, I amorously hugged his head to my breast, 
concentrating rather more upon my project than upon his pleasures, I 
expertly rifled all his pockets, one after another. A thin little purse 
seeming to contain all the money he had upon his person, I con- 
cluded that the treasure was cached in his paper case and, adroitly - 


Juliette 113 


snatching it out of the right-hand pocket of his coat, I slipped it 
under the mattress of the bed we were toiling on. 

Having attended to the crucial part of the affair and finding 
the rest little to my taste, being under no further obligation to 
pamper the great stinking lout wallowing on top of me, I ring; a 
woman appears, helps the German dignitary readjust himself and 
gives him a properly dosed glass of liqueur; he quaffs it off, and she 
guides him to a bedchamber where he falls straight into a profound 
sleep that had him still snoring eight hours later. 

A moment after he’s gone, Dorval enters. 

‘You are a wonder, my angel,” he cries, embracing me, “a 
wonder, a delight! I missed. not a thing. Oh, you maneuvered him 
artfully! And, believe me, I appreciate such performances. Look 
here,” he goes on, showing me a prick hard as a bar of iron, “if I 
am in such a state ’tis owing to your skill.” 

And as he leaped onto the bed with me, I discovered that this 
libertine’s idiosyncrasy was, with his mouth, to pilfer the fuck 
lately shot into my cunt..He pumped it so cleverly, so deliciously 
ran a swift and active tongue along its outer edges, darted the 
instrument inside, all the way inside my womb, so well did he 
proceed that I flooded him myself—thanks a thousand times more, 
it may be, to the unusual deed I had just accomplished and to the 
character of the man who had got me to commit it than to the 
pleasure I was receiving from him; for, to whatever degree he may 
have affected me physically, I cannot deny that, morally, I was much 
more deeply stirred by the gratuitous horror Fatima’s and Dor- 
val:s enticements were bringing me to undertake with such delicious 
results. 

Dorval did not discharge a drop. I turned the purse and the 
paper case over to him; he took them both, didn’t pause to examine 
either, and I ceded my place to Fatima. Dorval led me away with 
him, and while, peering through a spy-hole, he observed the tech- 
nique my companion was employing to achieve the same object, the 
libertine had me frig him, and frigged me in return. Now and then 
he’d thrust his tongue into my very gullet, he looked to be in 
seventh heaven. Marvelous effects wrought by the conjuncture of 
crime and lust, oh, the energy they impart to the passions’ delirium ! 
Fatima’s nimble proceedings finally determine Dorval’s ejaculation; 


114 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thrusting hard against me, he encunts me to the hilt and washes 
me with the unequivocal testimonies of the ecstasy he has just 
succumbed to. 

A vigorous man, Dorval returns to my companion. I clap my 
eye to the spy-hole, I see every last detail: as he did with me, so 
now he bends down between Fatima’s thighs and presently drains 
her cunt of Conrad’s fuck as previously he relieved me of Scheff- 
ner’s; next, he accepts the booty and, the two good Germans being 
tucked away for the night, we move into an exquisite little cabinet 
where Dorval, after faving spat a second charge of seed into 
Fatima’s cunt while tonguing mine, delivers the apology for his 
originalities of taste that is here very exactly reproduced: 

‘Kind friends, by a single feature alone were men distin- 
guished from one another when, long ago, society was in its in- 
fancy: the essential point was brute strength. Nature gave them all 
space wherein to dwell, and it was upon this physical force, dis- 
tributed to them with less impartiality, that was to depend the 
manner in which they were to share the world. Was this sharing to 
be equal, could it possibly be, what with the fact that-naked force 
was to decide the matter? In the beginning, then, was theft; theft, 
I say, was the basis, the starting point; for the inequality of this 
sharing necessarily supposes a wrong done the weak by the strong, 
and there at once we have this wrong, that is to say, theft, estab- 
lished, authorized by Nature since she gives man that which must 
necessarily lead him thereto. On the other hand, the weak revenge 
themselves, they put their wits to work, their cunning to use, in 
order to recover possession of what force has wrested from them, 
and there you have deceit, theft’s sister and likewise daughter to 
Nature. Were theft offensive to Nature, she would have accorded 
equal physical and mental capacities to all men; all men existing on 
an equal footing, Nature would thus have ensured that to every 
man a fair share in the things of this world would fall and would 
thus have prevented anybody from enriching himself to the detri- 
ment of his neighbor. Under these conditions, theft would be 
impossible. But when from the hands of the Nature who creates 
him man receives a conformation which necessitates both the in- 
equality of what is allotted to each and hence theft, how then may 
One persist in ignorance and suppose that Nature is loath to have 


Juliette & 115 


us steal? To the contrary, she so plainly indicates that to steal is 
her fundamental commandment that she makes theft the basis of 
all animal instinct. Only by constant thefts do animals manage to 
preserve themselves, only by countless usurpations do they main- 
tain their existences. And how ever has man—himself, after all, but 
an animal—been able to delude himself into thinking that what 
Nature implanted in the very soul of animals can be a crime in her 
eyes or for him? 

‘“‘When the first laws were promulgated, when the weak indi- 
vidual agreed to surrender part of his independence to ensure 
the rest of it, the maintenance of his goods was incontestably the 
first thing he desired, and so to enjoy in peace whatever little he 
had, he made its protection the prime object of the regulations he 
wanted formulated. The powerful individual assented to these laws 
which he knew very well he would never obey. And so the laws were 
made. It was decreed that every man would possess his heritage, 
undisturbed and happy; and that whosoever were to trouble him in 
this possession of what was his would be chastised. But in this there 
was nothing natural, nothing dictated by Nature, nothing of what 
she inspires, it was all very brazenly man-made, by men henceforth 
divided into two classes: those who yielded up a quarter of the loaf 
in order to be able, undisturbed, to eat and digest what was left; 
and those who, eagerly taking the portion profferred to them and 
seeing that they’d get the rest of the bread whenever they pleased, 
agreed to the scheme, not in order to prevent their own class from 
pillaging the weak, but to prevent the weak from despoiling one 
another—so that they, the powerful, could despoil the weak more 
conveniently. Thus, theft, instituted by Nature, was not at all 
banished from the face of the earth; but it came to exist in other 
forms: stealing was performed juridically. The magistrates stole 
by having themselves feed for doing the justice they ought to render 
free of charge. The priest stole by taking payment for serving as 
intermediary between God and man. The merchant stole by selling 
his sack of potatoes at a price one-third above the intrinsic value a 
sack of potatoes really has. Sovereigns stole by imposing arbitrary 
tithes, dues, taxes, levies upon their subjects. All these plunderings 
were permitted, they were all authorized in the precious name of 
right, and where are we today? we observe men take legal action 


116 e&& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


against what? Against the most natural right of all, that is, against 
the simple right of every man who, lacking money, demands it at 
gunpoint of those whorn he suspects to be wealthier than he. This 
fellow they call a criminal, and never once do they remember that 
the first thieves, of whom and to whom no one breathed a word of 
reproach, against whom no one protested, were uniquely responsible 
for the crimes of the second—were and are uniquely responsible for 
the obligation of this second man to find himself a weapon and by 
force to recuperate whut the first usurper tore so unceremoniously 
away from him. For, if all these thieveries can be perfectly well 
understood as usurpations which necessitated the indigence of sub- 
ordinate beings, these same inferiors’ subsequent thefts, rendered 
inevitable by the earlier thefts of their betters, can scarcely be 
viewed as crimes; but rather as secondary effects ineluctably precipi- 
tated by primary causes; and the moment you assent to that primary 
cause, you forego the possibility of lawfully punishing its effects. To 
be sure, you may punish them, but only unjustly. If you elbow a 
servant against a costly vase, if, as he slips and falls, he breaks the 
vase, you have no right to penalize him for clumsiness; instead, you 
must direct your wrath upon the cause that drove you to mistreat 
him. When that wretched peasant, reduced to beggardom by the

gets hold of a pistol, and goes off to waylay you along the highway, 
you may punish him, yes, but if you do, I say that you commit a very 
great infamy; for he’s not at fault, he’s the valet your roughness 
made upset the vase: den’t push him about and he’ll not break any- 
thing; and if you do push him, don’t be surprised when things get 
broken. Thus when he sets out to rob you this poor fellow commits 
no crime; he’s merely striving to recover some of the substance 
you and others like you had previously snatched away from him. 
He is doing nothing that isn’t completely natural, he is trying to 
redress the balance which, in the moral as well as the physical 
realm, is Nature’s highest law: the peasant become desperado is 
perfectly right and what he does, perfectly just. But that isn’t quite

what I was aiming to prove; however, proofs‘aren’t needed, there’s 
no need of arguments to demonstrate that the weak individual is 
doing nothing more nor less than what he must when he attempts 
his utmost to recover things which were once torn from his grasp. 
What I should like to convince you of is that neither does the power- 
ful individual commit a crime or an injustice when he strives to 
despoil the weak. I should like to convince you of that, for it is my 
own case, and I indulge in this act every day. Well, this demonstra- 
tion is easy enough : theft perpetrated by a strong man is assuredly a 
better and more valid act, within the terms and from the standpoint 
of Nature, than the weak man’s theft; for Nature prescribes no 
reprisals which the weak may take upon the strong; these reprisals 
may exist in the moral form, but certainly not in the physical, since, 
to take physical reprisals the weak man must make use of physical 
forces he does not possess, he must adopt a character that has not 
been given him, in short, he must in some sort fly in the face of 
Nature. That sage mother’s laws unambiguously stipulate that the 
mighty harm the feeble, since for what other purpose have their 
powers been invested in the mighty? The strong individual, unlike 
the weak, never dons masks, he at all times acts true to his own 
character, his character is the one he has received from Nature, and 
whatever he does is an honest and direct expression thereof and in 
the highest sense and degree natural: his oppression, his violence, 
his cruelties, his tyrannies, his injustices, all these outbursts are of 
the character instilled in him by the power that gave him life on 
earth; all these are then simple, straightforward, and therefore 
pure emanations of what he is, as pure as the hand that engraved 
the necessity for them in him; and when he exercises all his rights 
to oppress the weak, to strip and ruin the weak, he therefore does 
the most natural thing in the world. Had our common dam desired 
this equality that the weak long to establish, had she truly desired 
that property be equally shared, why would she have divided the 
mighty and the weak into two classes? By so differentiating men has 
she not made her intention amply clear, to wit, that the discrepancies 
between physical faculties have their counterpart in material dis- 
crepancies ? Does she not make manifest her design, that to the lion 
goes the whole share and to the mouse nothing; and this precisely 
in order to achieve the equilibrium that is the single basis to her 


118 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


whole system? For, in order that equilibrium reign in the natural 
scheme, it must not be men who install it there; Nature’s equi- 
librium is disturbance unto men: what to us seems to unsettle the 
grand balance of things is precisely what, in Nature’s view, estab- 
lishes it, and the reason therefor is as follows: this that we take to 
be lack of equilibrium -esults in the crimes through which order is 
restored in the universal economy. The mighty make away with 
everything—that, men agree, is unbalance. The weak react and 
pillage the strong—there, redressing the scales you have the crimes 
which are necessary to Nature. So let us never have qualms over 
what we will be able to snatch from the weak, for it isn’t we who 
in acting thus qualify our gesture as criminal; it is the weak man’s 
reaction or vengeance ‘which so characterizes it: robbing the poor, 
despoiling the orphan, fleecing the widow of her inheritance, man 
does no more than make rightful use of the rights Nature has given 
him. Crime? Ha! The only crime would consist in not exploiting 
these rights: the indigent man, placed by Nature within the range 
of our depradations, is so much food for the vulture Nature pro- 
tects. If the powerful man looks to be causing some disturbance 
when he robs those wh» lie at his feet, the prostrate restore order 
by arising to steal frorn their superiors; great and small, they all 
serve Nature. 

“Tracing the right of property back to its source, one infal- 
libly arrives at usurpation. However, theft is only punished because 
it violates the right of property; but this right is itself nothing in 
origin but theft; thus, the law punishes the thief for attacking 
thieves, punishes the weak for attempting to recover what has been 
stolen from him, punist.es the strong for wishing either to establish 
or to augment his wealth through exercising the talents and prerog- 
atives he has received from Nature. What a shocking series of 
inane illogicalities! So ‘ong as there shall be no legitimately estab- 
lished title to property (and never will there be any such thing), it 
will remain very difficult to prove that theft is crime, for the loss 
theft causes here is restitution there; and Nature being no more 
concerned for what happens on the one side than on the other, it is 
perfectly impossible for anyone in his right mind to affirm that the 
favoring of either side to the disadvantage of the other can con- 
stitute an infraction of her laws.

‘‘And so the weaker party is quite correct when, seeking to re- 
cover his usurped goods, he deliberately attacks the stronger party 
and, if all goes well, forces him to relinquish them; the only wrong 
he can commit is in betraying the character, that of weakness, with 
which Nature has stamped him: she created him to be a slave and 
poor, he declines to submit to slavery and poverty, there’s his fault; 
and the stronger party, without that same fault because he remains 
true to his character and acts only in strait accordance therewith, is 
also and equally right when he seeks to rob the weak and to enjoy 
himself at their expense. And now let each of them pause a moment 
and inspect his own heart. In deciding to assault the strong, the 
weak individual, whatever may be the rights justifying his decision, 
will be subject to mild doubts and waverings; and this hesitation to 
proceed and gain satisfaction comes from the fact he is just about 
to overstep the laws of Nature by assuming a character which is 
not native to him. The strong individual, on the contrary, when he 
despoils the weak, when, that is to say, he enters actively into the 
enjoyment of the rights Nature has conferred upon him, by exer- 
cising them to the full, reaps pleasure in proportion to the greater 
or lesser extent he gives to the realization of his potentialities. The 
more atrocious the hurt he inflicts upon the helpless, the greater 
shall be the voluptuous vibrations in him; injustice is his delectation, 
he glories in the tears his heavy hand wrings from the unlucky; the 
more he persecutes him, the happier the despot feels, for it is now 
that he makes the greatest use of the gifts Nature has bestowed 
upon him; putting these gifts to use is a veritable need, and satisfy- 
ing that need an incisive pleasure. Moreover, this necessary pleas- 
ure-taking, which is born of the comparison made by the happy 
man between his lot and the unhappy man’s, this truly delicious 
sensation is never more deeply registered in the fortunate man than 
when the distress he produces is complete. The more he crushes his 
woe-ridden prey, the more extreme he renders the contrast and the 
more rewarding the comparison; and the more, consequently, he 
adds fuel to the fire of his lust. Thus, from hammering the weak 
he gleans two exceedingly keen pleasures: the augmentation of his 
material substance and resources and the moral enjoyment of 
the comparisons which he renders all the more voluptuous the more 
suffering he inflicts upon the miserable. So let him pillage, let him 


120 e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


burn and ravage and wreck; to this wretch he fastens on let 
him leave nothing but the breath which will prolong a life whose 
continuation is necessary to the oppressor if he is to be able to go on 
making the comparison; let him do as he likes, he’ll do nothing that 
isn’t natural and sanctioned by Nature, whatever he invents will be 
nought but the issue of the active powers entrusted to him, the more 
he puts his potentialities into play, the more pleasure he’ll have; 
the better the use to which he puts his faculties, to Nature the better 
servant will he be. 

“Allow me, dear girls,” Dorval pursued, ‘‘to cite a few 
precedents in support of my theses; the two of you have benefited 
from the sort of education that will enable you to understand the 
examples I am about to set forth. 

“Theft is held in sach lofty esteem in Abyssinia that the chief 
of a robber band purchases a license and the right to steal in peace. 

“This same act is commendable among the Koriacks; it is the 
sole means to winning honor and a name in that nation. 

“Among the Tohcukichi, a girl cannot marry until she has 
shown her mettle in this profession. 

“With the Mingrelians, theft is a mark of skill and sign of

“Under the feudal regime, France was scarcely more than one

owners’ names. 

“You may set your minds at rest, there is no conceivable | 
manner of appropriating to oneself the belongings of others that is — 
not wholly legitimate. Craft, cunning, force—so many astute means 
for attaining a valid end; the weak individual’s objective is to see 
to the more equitable distribution of what is worth having; that of 
the powerful is to get, to have, to accumulate, to engross, no matter 
how, at no matter whose expense. When the law of Nature requires 
an upheaval, does Nature fret over what will be undone in its 
course ? All men’s actions are only the result of Nature’s laws; this 
should be of comfort to man, this should dissuade him from trem- 
bling before any deed—this should engage him calmly to perpetrate 
every deed, whatever its kind or magnitude. Nothing occurs ac- 
cidentally; everything in this world is of necessity; well, necessity 
excuses no matter what; and as soon as an action demonstrates 
itself necessary it can no more be considered infamous. 

“A son of the remarkable Cameron, whom I mentioned a

were blindly obeyed by his men, every stolen article was stored in a

others, however, where its effects are atrocious, and J shall have 
you notice its iniquity. This little demonstration won’t be at all 
irrelevant. But, before continuing our dissertation, I’ll make one or 
two very simple comments upon this law of the talion. 


122 » THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


““We suppose that Peter insults and mistreats Paul; next, in the 
court where tit for tat holds sway, Peter is made to suffer everything 
he has inflicted upon Paul. This is crying injustice; for when Peter 
perpetrated against Paul the injury in question, he had motives 
which, consonant with all the laws of natural equity, in considerable 
measure lessened the heinous quality of his offense; but when to 
punish him you treat him in the same way he treated Paul, you have 
not the same motive that inspired Peter, yet you wrong him just as 
deeply. Thus, there is a very significant difference between him and 
you: he committed an atrocity that was based upon motives, and 
you commit the same a:rocity with none at all. What I have just 
said ought to illustrate the extreme injustice of a law which is so 
greatly admired by fools.’ 

“There was a time when the German magnates counted among 
their rights that of highway robbery. This right derives from the 
earliest and most fundzmental institutions in societies, where the 
free man or vagabond gut his livelihood in the manner of the beasts 
of the forests and the birds of the air: by wresting food from 
whatever convenient or possible source; in those times, he was a 
child and student of Nature, today he is the slave of ludicrous 
prejudices, abominable laws, and idiotic religions. All the good 
things of this world, cries the weak individual, were equally dis- 
tributed over the surfacz of the globe. Very well. But, by creating 
weak and strong, Nature with sufficient clarity announced that she 
intended these good things to go to the strong alone, and that the 
weak were to be deprived of all enjoyment of them save that 
pittance which would bedall them as so many crumbs from the table 
around which sit the mighty, despotic, and capricious. Nature bade 
the latter enrich themselves by stealing from the weak and the weak 
take redress by stealing irom the rich; so spoke she unto men in the 
same language wherein she advised wild birds to steal the seed 
from out of the ploughed furrow, the wolf to devour the lamb, the 
spider to spin webs to snare flies. All, all is theft, all is unceasing 
~~ 13 We owe the law of the tulion to the indolence and imbecility of legislators. How 
much simpler they found it to chortle 4n eye for an eye than intelligently and equit- 
ably to proportion the punish nent to the offense. The latter proceeding requires 
superior intellectual endowment; and, save for three or four exceptional cases, I know 


of no French lawmaker during the past eighteen hundred years who has been able to

and rigorous competition in Nature; the desire to make off with the 
substance of others is the foremost—the most legitimate—passion 
Nature has bred into us. These are the basic laws of conduct that 
her hand has writ in our bone and fiber, theft is the underlying in- 
stinct in all living beings and, without doubt, the most agreeable one. 

“Theft was held in honor at Lacedaemon. Lycurgus’ constitu- 
tion made it mandatory; stealing, said that great lawgiver, rendered 
the Spartans supple, quick, bold, and brave; it is still admired in the 
Philippines. 

‘The Germans considered it an exercise very suitable to youth; 
there were festivals during which the Romans smiled upon it; the 
Egyptians included it in their educational curricula; every American 
is much addicted to theft; nothing is more widespread in Africa; 
beyond the Alps it is hardly discouraged. 

“Every night, Nero used to quit his palace and go abroad to 
steal in the streets; on the morrow, what he had robbed his country- 
men of was put on public sale in the market place, and the profits 
went to the Emperor. 

“The Président Rieux, son of Samuel Bernard and Boulainvil- 
liers’ father, stole through inclination and with our own purposes 
in view: on the Pont-Neuf, a pistol in his hand, he waylaid passers- 
by and emptied their pockets. Coveting a watch he saw on the 
person of a friend of his father, he, so the story goes, awaited him 
one evening when this friend was leaving Samuel’s house after a 
supper, and robbed him; straightway the friend returns to the 
brigand’s father, complains, identifies the thief; Samuel denies it, 
says the thing is impossible, swears his boy is asleep in his bed; 
they repair to the son’s bedchamber, Rieux isn’t there. A little later 
he comes home; they are sitting waiting for him, he is reproached, 
accused, he confesses this and many other thefts, promises to mend 
his ways and does: subsequently, Rieux becomes a very great 
magistrate."* 

‘‘Nothing more readily conceivable than theft as debauch: it 
occasions the indispensable shock upon the nervous system and 
thence is born the inflammation which determines the lubricious 
mood. Everybody like me—and who, like me, quite needlessly, has

stolen through libertinage—is acquainted with ‘this secret pleasure; 
one may also experience it by cheating at the gaming table, or while 
playing games of any other sort. A thoroughgoing cheat was the 
Comte de X., he would te subject to the most imperious irritations 
when gambling ; I once saw him obliged to fleece a young man to the 
tune of a hundred Jowis; zhe Comte, I believe, had an extraordinary 
desire to fuck the young man and simply couldn’t obtain an erection 
except by stealing. The game of whist starts, the Comte steals, up 
soars his prick, he embuggers the youth—but, as I distinctly recall, 
did not by any means return his money. 

‘‘Governed by the same principles and for identical purposes, 
Argafond steals whateve: he can lay hands upon; he has established 
a bawdyhouse where a complement of charming creatures despoil 
all the clients. The insoleit rogue does very nicely. 

‘‘But who are greater thieves than our financiers? Let me give 
you an example; it comes from the last century : 

‘There were then in all the realm nine hundred millions in 
specie; toward the close of the reign of Louis XIV, the people were 
paying 750,000,000 in taxes per annum and, of this sum, only 
250,000,000 found the way into the royal exchequer; which means 
half a billion went yearly into the pockets of thieves. They were 
thus very great thieves; do you suppose these thefts weighed 
heavily upon their conscience ?”’ 

“Well,” was my reply to Dorval, ‘I am not unimpressed by 
your catalogue, I savor your arguments, but I do declare I am far 
from being able to understand how someone as rich as, for example, 
you yourself can derive pleasure from stealing.” 

‘‘Because, when performed, the act has a strong impact upon 
the nervous system, I’ve told you so, and this impact, as it would 
seem to me my erection ought to have demonstrated to you,” 
Dorval answered, “is extremely voluptuous in my case, rich though 
I happen to be; rich or not, I am constructed like any other man. I 
may add, howbeit, that, in my view, I possess no more than is 
necessary to me, and having what is necessary doesn’t make one 
rich. What does, is having more than is necessary; my thefts cause 
my already filled cup to overflow. No, I repeat, ’tis not through 
satisfying our primary negds that we achieve happiness, ’tis through 
acquiring and exercising the power to appease our avid little 


Juliette & 125 


whimsies, and they tend toward insatiability ; he who has only what | 
he requires to supply his wants, he cannot be called happy. He is | 
poor.” 

The night was advancing, Dorval had further need of us, 
there were further lubricious episodes he wanted to expose us to, 
the enterprises he had in mind called for rest, silence, and calm. 

‘Throw those Germans into a carriage, will you,” said he to 
one of his hirelings, a man who was accustomed to doing what was 
needed under these circumstances, ‘‘get them out of here, they’ll 
not wake up. Strip them and dump them naked in some out-of-the- 
way street. God takes care of his little children.” 

“Sir!” I cried, “what wanton cruelty!” 

“Do you think so? Never mind. They’ve satisfied me, I never 
for one instant wanted more than that from them; can you tell me 
what use I have of them now? So we’ll deliver them into the safe- 
keeping of Providence; that’s what Providence is there for, after 
all. If Nature has any use for that pair you may rest assured they’ll 
not perish ; but if she hasn’t, very likely they shall.” 

“But it is you who exposes them to disaster—”’ 

“I? I only cooperate with Nature: I carry things to a certain 
stage, there I stop, her puissant arm does the rest. Let them go. 
Fortunate they may count themselves that I do not do still worse; 
perhaps, indeed, I ought to. .. .” 

Dorval’s command was executed without delay; transported to 
the carriage, the two Germans, sound asleep, were removed. Of 
what happened to them I can recount this: that, as we learned 
afterward, they were deposited in a blind alley near a boulevard 
and, the next morning, taken to the commissary of police, finally 
to be released when it was clear to the authorities that neither of 
the men could provide the faintest explanation of the strange ad- 
venture that had befallen them. 

Once the Germans had been carted off, Dorval gave us exactly 
one-quarter of what we had taken from them; then he left the 
room. Fatima warned me that yet another redoubtable scene of 
lechery lay ahead; she couldn’t predict just what the drama would 
consist in, but she was sure nothing grave would happen to us. 
Scarcely had she finished whispering those words when a woman 
appeared in the doorway and summoned us to follow her; we did as 


126 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


we were told; after mounting some flights of stairs and walking 
down some corridors in the uppermost part of the house, she pushed 
us into a dark room where, until Dorval arrived, we could make 
out nothing of our surroundings. 

It was shortly after that Dorval came in. He was accompanied 
by two big rascals, moustached, of extremely sinister mien; they were 
bearing candles, their light revealed the strange furniture in this 
room. It was as I heard the door being bolted that my gaze fell 
upon the scaffold at the far end of the room. There stood two 
gibbets; deployed about was all the equipment needed for execution 
by the rope. 

Dorval spoke in 2. brusque tone: “Mesdemoiselles, you are 
going to receive punishinent for your crimes. You will undergo it 
here.” Thereupon, settl:ng himself in a large armchair, he bids his 
acolytes remove every stitch of clothing from our bodies—“Yes, 
stockings, shoes, everything.” Our garments are laid in a heap at 
his feet. He rummages through them, takes all the money he finds 
in our pockets; then, rolling everything into a bundle, he tosses it 
out the window. 

His face is impassi’e, his voice phlegmatic. As though to him- 
self, but his eyes fixed upon us, he murmurs: “Useless, that stuff. A 
shroud for each of them. And I’ve got the two coffins ready.” 

From beneath the scaffold one of Dorval’s agents does indeed 
drag out two coffins. He arranges them side by side. 

‘Duly aware as both of you are,” Dorval then said, “of having 
earlier this same day, and in this same locality which is my house, 
wickedly robbed two good people of their gems and of their gold, 
I am nonetheless under obligation to represent that truth to you and 
to inquire of you: Are you or are you not guilty of this fell deed?” 

‘We are guilty, my Lord,” Fatima replied. 

I however was speechless. So terrifying were these proceedings 
that I was beginning to lose my wits. 

‘Since you avow your crime,” Dorval resumed, “‘further for- 
malities would be to no ‘.urpose; be that as it may, I must have a 
full confession. Is it not so, Juliette,” the traitor continued, ad- 
dressing me and thus forcing me to speak, ‘“‘is it not true that you 
are responsible for their death, in the course of the night did you 
not, inhumanly, have then cast naked into the street?” 


Juliette % 127 


“Sir!” I stammered, ‘“‘you yourself—” 

Then, checking myself, I said: 

“Yes. We are guilty of that crime, too.” 

‘“‘Well then, I have but to pronounce sentence. You will both 
hear it upon your knees. Kneel, I say. Now approach.” 

We knelt, we approached. ’Twas then I spied the effect this 
horrible scene was producing upon that libertine. Obliged to give 
freedom to #2 member whose swelling proportions could no longer 
endure confinement in his breeches, he opened his fly and, as when 
one releases a young sapling which one has bent and tied down to 
the ground, so now this prick sprang upright and towered aloft. 

Dorval set to frigging himself. “You're going to be hanged 
. .. you're going to be choked absolutely to death, the two of you! 
The whores Rose Fatima and Claudine Juliette are condemned to 
die for having villainously, odiously robbed and despoiled and then 
exposed, with clear intent to destroy, two- individuals who were 
guests in the home of Monsieur Dorval: justice in consequence 
requires that the sentence be executed immediately.” 

We stood up and, at a signal from one of his myrmidons, first 
I, then Fatima advanced up to him. He was in a lather. We frigged 
his prick, he swore and stormed: his hands roved distractedly over 
every part of our bodies and with curses and threats he mixed jibes. 

“How cruel I am,” said he, “‘to consign such lovely flesh to the 
dungheap. But there’s no hope of reprieve, the sentence has been 
pronounced, it’s got to be carried out; these cunts, so inviting today, 
will be the abode of maggots tomorrow. . . . Ah, doublefuck the 
Almighty, what pleasures. . . .” 

Then his two lieutenants laid hands on Fatima—and I con- 
tinued to frig Dorval. The poor girl was bound in a trice, the 
halter was slipped around her neck, but everything was so. arranged 
that the victim, after hanging the briefest instant in the air, would 
fall to the floor where a mattress was spread. Then came my. turn; 
I tremble, fear blinds me—of what they’d done to Fatima I’d seen 
only enough to be terrified, the rest had escaped me, and it was 
only after my own experience that I realized how little danger had 
been involved in this curious ritual. And so, when the two men came 
for me, overcome with fear, I cast myself at Dorval’s feet: my 
resistance aroused him: he bit my flank with such violence the 


128 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


marks his teeth left were still there two months later. They 
dragged me away and several seconds afterward I was lying motion- 
less beside Fatima. Dorval comes over to where we are, peers at us. 

“Sacred bugger-fucking Christ!’ he expostulates, “do you 
mean to say the bitches are still alive ?” 

“Begging your pardon, Sir,” one of his men informs him, “ ’tis 
done, they breathe no more.” 

And it is at this point Dorval’s dark passion reaches its 
denouement: he leaps upon Fatima—who takes care not to stir a 
muscle—he encunts her with a prick gone mad and after several 
ferocious strokes he springs away and assails me—and I too am 
lying still as death; swearing like one of the damned, he drives his 
member to the hilt in my vagina and his discharge is accompanied 
by symptoms of pleasure more resembling fury than joy. 

Was he ashamed? Or was he disgusted? Whichever, we saw 
no more of Dorval. As for the valets, they’d vanished the moment 
their master had bounded upon the scaffold to belabor us in his 
frenzy. The same woman who had introduced us into this attic 
chamber now reappeared, released us; she brought us refreshments, 
assured us our ordeal was over but also advised us that nothing of 
what had been taken away from us would be given back. 

‘My instructions ave to restore you naked to where you came 
from,” she continued. ‘‘You’ll do whatever complaining you wish 
to Madame Duvergier, she'll look into the matter as she sees fit. So 
let’s be off, tis late, you must be home before dawn.” 

Angry, I ask to speak to Dorval, I am told I cannot—although 
the odd fellow was in all likelihood surveying us through one of his 
peepholes. The woman repeats that we must make haste; a carriage 
is there awaiting us, we climb in, and a little more than an hour 
later we enter our matron’s house. 

Madame Duvergier was still in bed. Retiring to our rooms, 
we each found ten louis and a complete new costume, in quality far 
superior to those we'd lest. 

“We'll not say anything. Agreed? For we've been paid, our 
clothing has been better than replaced,” Fatima pointed out, “and 
there would be no advartage to having Duvergier know about our 
outing. I told you, Juliette, these things go on behind her back and 
they’d best stay there. When we’re not obliged to share our earn- 


Juliette & 129 


ings with her, there’s no need to mention our employment.” Fatima 
gazed at me for a moment. “My dear,” she went on, “‘you’ve just 
paid a very cheap price for a very great lesson; be easy, the bargain 
you've struck was good. With what you've learned at Dorval’s 
hands, provided you don’t forget it, you are now in a way to make 
every one of your adventures yield triple or four times what they’d 
be worth to the uninitiated.” 

“T really don’t know whether I’d dare without having someone 
else along to bolster my courage,” I told my companion. 

“You'd be a fool to let a single opportunity pass,” Fatima 
asserted; ‘“‘bear Dorval’s ethics and advice ever in mind; equality, 
my beloved, equality, that’s my one guiding principle, and where- 
ever it’s not been established by chance or fate, that’s where it is 
up to us to create it by our ingenuity.” 


Several days later I had an interview with Madame Duvergier. 
After inspecting me, she said: 

“It looks to me as though your natural deflowerings are just 
about complete; well, Juliette, you must now start earning your way 
hindwise, and you'll have an even greater success than you did 
when we took toll for transit in your frontward avenue. The state of 
affairs, I tell you, requires that we reverse our approach hence- 
forth. I trust you'll not raise any,silly objections; in the past I’ve 
had some preposterous little simpletons here who, affirming that it 
is criminal to give oneself thus to men, brought no good repute to 
my house and considerable harm to my commerce. Untutored as you 
may be, rather than utter infantile nonsense which you'll later 
blush at having pronounced, pray be still for a moment and listen 
to me. 

“I must inform you, my child, that it boils down to the same 
thing: a woman is a woman everywhere, she does as well—and 
certainly no worse—when she cedes her ass as when she opens her 
cunt to traffic, she has as great a right to take a prick in her mouth 
as to fondle one in her hand, if her thighs clasped together can be 
of service to one man, why should she deny her armpits to another? 
It’s all one and the same, my angel; the essential thing is to earn 
money, how it’s got is a matter of indifference.

“There are even those—incurable fools for the most part, the 
rest are clowns—who dare maintain that sodomy is a crime against 
society because it negatively affects the birth rate. This is absolutely 
false; there will always be more than enough human beings on earth 
whatever may be the progress of sodomy. But, supposing for an 
instant that. the ranks of the population were to begin to thin, 
would one not have to lay the blame upon Nature? for ’tis from no 
other source that those individuals who incline to this passion have 
received not only the taste and the penchant which draw them into 
practicing buggery, but also the faulty or thwart constitution which 
renders them ill-adapted to sensual pleasure in the ordinary manner 
we women procure it for them. And is it not Nature, once again, 
who, after we have acted for an extended period in accordance with 
the so-called laws of population, finally deprives us of the where- 
withal to give men any real pleasure? Now, if Nature so operates 
as simultaneously to make it impossible for men to taste legitimate 
pleasures on the one hand, and on the other to constitute women 
in precisely the opposite fashion to that which would be necessary 
to the continued tasting of even an insipid pleasure, it is amply 
clear, so it seems to me, tat the alleged outrages which, oafs would 
have it, man commits when he seeks pleasure elsewhere than with 
women, or with them elsewhere than cuntwardly—these fancied 
outrages, I say, rather than being offensive to Nature, can be no 
other than of that same Nature’s inspiration. To offset the priva- 
tions her primary laws impose upon man, Nature, subsequently, is 
nothing loath to grant him certain facilities, especially since, as may 
very well be the case, she herself is eager, or obliged, to limit the 
increase of population whose excessive size can but be to her dis- 
advantage. And this latter idea is all the-more evident in the fact 
that Nature has limited the time during which women can bear. 
Why these limitations and deadlines, if perpetual increase were so 
necessary as is sometimes fancied? and if Nature has set these 
limits, why shouldn’t she have set others? She has posed a term to 
every woman’s fecundity; in man, her wisdom would also have in- 
spired varying passions o- certain distastes : while some members of 
the community do their daty, others, differently made, must go else- 
where to relieve themselves of the seed for which Nature herself 
has no use. Why, without going far afield in search of explanations, 


Juliette & 131 


we can confine ourselves to an immediate, palpable, and conclusive 
one: the sensation itself; and, without further discussion, ’tis there 
the place where Nature wishes to have her bidding done. Well, 
Juliette, you may rest assured of this,” Duvergier continued, little 
realizing that the person she was speaking to was not without ex- 
perience in the matter, “that it is infinitely more pleasurable to be 
had in the hinder part than in any other; sensual women, once they 
have made the experiment, either forget about or revolt at the 
thought of cunt-fuckery. Ask around, you'll find that they all say 
the same. Therefore, my child, try the thing for the sake of your 
pocketbook and in the interests of your pleasure; and you may be 
perfectly sure that men are willing to pay a very different price to 
have this eccentricity of theirs flattered than for common belly- 
bumping; if today I have an income totaling thirty thousand pounds 
a year, I can honestly assure you that I owe three-quarters of it to 
the assholes I’ve rented to the general public. Cunts don’t bring a 
penny anymore, my dear girl, they aren’t in fashion these days, 
people are tired of them, you simply cannot sell a cunt to anyone, 
and I'd give up this business tomorrow if I couldn’t find women 
favorably disposed to rendering this essential courtesy. 

“Tomorrow morning, dear heart,” the shameless creature con- 
cluded, “your masculine maidenhead goes to the venerable Arch- 
bishop of Lyon, who pays me fifty Jouis apiece for these articles. 
Look sharp, see to it you offer no resistance to the good prelate’s 
enervated desires, they'll faint entirely away at the first hint of 
skittishness on your part. It shall be far less to your charms than 
to a docile eagerness to please that you'll owe your conquest and 
proofs of an already much impaired virility; whereas if the old 
despot doesn’t find a slave in you, you'll get no more out of him 
than you'd have from a statue.” 

Having been perfectly trained in the role I am to play, on the 
morrow I arrive at nine o'clock at the Abbaye de Saint-Victor, 
where the holy man lodged when stopping in Paris; he was attend- 
ing me in bed. 

He turned toward a very beautiful woman of about thirty and 
whose function there, I guessed, was to act as a kind of administra- 
tor during the Archbishop’s lubricious frolickings. “‘Madame La- 
croix, will you have that little girl I see there step nearer.” He 


132 >» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


peered at me for a while. ‘Eh, no, it’s not bad, truly not bad. And 
how old is my little cherubim ?” 

“Fifteen and a half, Monseigneur.” 

‘Why then, Madame Lacroix, you might undress her. You will 
remember to be careful, omit none of the customary precautions.” 

No sooner was I naked than I readily divined the purpose of 
these precautions. The devout sectator of Sodom, what with his 
extreme apprehensiveness lest the anterior charms of a woman 
upset the illusion he was laboring to form, required that these 
attractions be screened so completely from his view that the possi- 
bility of even suspecting their existence be circumvented. And, in- 
deed, Madame Lacroix swaddled me up so thoroughly that not 
the least trace of them remained to be seen. This done, the accom- 
modating creature led me to Monseigneur’s bedside. 

“The ass, Madam, the ass,”’ said he, ‘‘and, I beseech you, 
nothing but the ass. Pause for a moment: have you taken every 
necessary step?” 

“T have, Monseigneur, and your Eminence will notice that as 
I expose to him the part he desires to behold, I offer to his libertine 
homage the prettiest virgin ass it were possible to embrace.” 

“Yes, yes, upon my soul,” Monseigneur mutters, “ ’tis rather 
handsomely turned; stand back there, I’m going to caress it a little.” 

Lacroix maintaining me at the elevation and in the posture 
required in order that the dear Archbishop be able to kiss my 
buttocks at leisure, he fondles and rubs his face everywhere upon 
them for the space of a quarter of an hour. You may be sure that 
the caress most favored by people addicted to this taste—the caress, 
I wish to say, consisting in the profound insinuation of the tongue 
into the anus—is one o: the central features of the Archbishop’s 
routine; and his most uncompromising aversion for the neighboring 
aperture is at one point raanifested when, my cunt lips yawning ever 
so slightly, by mischance his tongue glides between them and, in- 
stantly recoiling, he thrusts me away with a look of such prodigious 
disgust and disdain that, had I been his mistress, I’d have fled 
twenty leagues away from his Eminence. This preliminary examina- 
tion over, Lacroix undresses; when she is nude, Monseigneur rises 
up from his bed. 

“Child,” says he, now placing me on the bed and adjusting me 


Juliette 133 


in the attitude his pleasures necessitate, ‘‘I trust that you have 
received somewhat by way of preparatory counsel. Docility and 
thoughtfulness, there are two qualities we cannot forego.” 

Gazing at him with innocence’s wide-open eyes and candor, I 
assured Monseigneur that he’d not find me wanting in willingness 
to do his whole bidding. 

“Very well, let us hope so. For the least disobedience will dis- 
please me beyond measure and, considering my extreme difficulty in 
getting the task properly started, you'll appreciate how distressed 
I am apt to become if, showing a lack of cooperation, you bring all 
our efforts to nought. I can say no more to you. Madame Lacroix, 
oil the passage and try to pilot my prick into the channel with skill 
enough, once we’re in there, we'll attempt to stick fast for a few 
moments before the discharge that will reward us for all this 
damnable trouble.” 

The amiable Lacroix seemed ready to move heaven and earth, 
so painstaking were her attentions. The Archbishop was not overly 
furnished; my complete resignation joined to Lacroix’ knowing 
maneuvers swiftly crowned the undertaking with success. 

‘Ah, there, that would seem to be it,” said the saintly man. 
“Faith, it’s been ages since I’ve had anything like so tight a fuck, 
oh, indeed! this is a virgin asshole I’m in, damn me if it’s not... . 
Lacroix, here, Lacroix, take your place, for everything indicates 
that my sperm is readying to spill into this celestial stoup.” 

That was the signal : Madame Lacroix rings and there arrives 
a second woman, at whom I had time only to glance quickly. Her 
sleeve is rolled up, in her hand she grasps a bundle of switches, she 
falls to belaboring the pontifical behind whilst Lacroix, leaping 
astride me, bends forward and offers her hind quarters to be colled 
and nuzzled by the lewd sodomite. He, rapidly vanquished by this 
combination of libidinous episodes, ejaculates into my anus a copi- 
ous mead the cadence of whose spurts is determined by the stout 
blows ravaging his backside. 

And that is that. Spent, Monseigneur climbs into bed again; 
his breakfast chocolate is ordered brought in; his governess puts 
her clothes back .on, she bids me go with the second woman. The 
latter, she of the sinewy arm, shows me to the door, hands me the 


134 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fifty Jouis for Durvergier and two more for myself, puts me in a 
cab and instructs the coachman to take me home. 

At the house the next day there’s pointed out to me a man of 
about fifty, very pale, with a very somber eye. That countenance 
augurs nothing good. 

Before leading me into the apartment where he has been wait- 
ing, Duvergier cautions me not to refuse anything this individual 
may ask of me. “He is one of my best patients, and if you disappoint 
him, my practice will sufter irreparably.” 

The man is given to sodomy; after some characteristic pre- 
liminaries, he turns me over, has me stretch out flat on the bed, and 
readies to embugger me. His hands grope about my buttocks, clutch 
them fast, spread them, the bugger is already in an ecstasy before 
the sweet little hole—and then it strikes me as very odd, indeed, the 
way he keeps himself out of sight, or at least this way he has of 
concealing his prick. Suddenly alarmed by some premonition, I twist 
around ...and what do my eyes behold! Great God, an instrument 
positively covered with pustules . . . seeping, oozing sores . . 
chancres, etc., abominable and only too eloquent symptoms of the 
venereal malady that is fairly consuming this ugly personage. 

“Sir! T cry, “are you mad? Look at the condition you are in! 
Have you any idea what you are about? Do you want to ruin me 
definitively ?” 

“What!” says the lecher, muttering through clenched teeth 
and making as if to take me by force, “what’s this! Objections! 
You'll do your protesting to the mistress of this house, she’ll tell 
you whether I know what I’m about. Do you suppose I’d pay such 
a price for women if it wasn’t for the pleasure of infecting them 
with my disease? I delight in nothing else; madness indeed! Do you 
suppose I wouldn't get myself cured if I didn’t enjoy this?” 

“Oh, I can assure you, Sir; no one told me of this—” and I 
rushed out of the room, found Duvergier and, as you may well 
imagine, upbraided her very energetically. The client overheard our 
argument, he came to where we were; he and Duvergier exchanged 
glances. 

“Calm yourself, Juliette—” 

‘Ah no, damn me if I’ll be calm, Madame,” said I, furious. 
“I’m not blind, I’ve seen what that gentleman—” 


Juliette & 135 


“Come, come now, you're surely mistaken. Be a good girl, 
Juliette, and return—”’ 

“Never,” said I, “I know what you’re up to. To think! That 
you were willing to sacrifice me—” 

“My dear Juliette—” ; 

“Your dear Juliette’s advice to you is to find someone else for 
the job. Hurry... the gentleman’s waiting. . . .” 

Duvergier sighed, shrugged her shoulders. 

“Sir—” she began. 

But he, having sworn to himself he’d ruin me, was greatly re- 
luctant to accept a substitute; only after long and heated discussion 
did he cede and agree to poison someone else. In the end, however, | 
everything was arranged, a new girl appeared, and | withdrew. My 
replacement was a little novice of thirteen or so, they blindfolded 
her, she suspected nothing, the operation was performed. It was a 
success: a week later she had to be sent to the hospital. Notified, 
the libertine betook himself there to contemplate her sufferings. 
Such was his keenest delight; Duvergier assured me that ever since 
she'd first become acquainted with him he had never cared for 
anything else. 

Fifteen or sixteen others, of similar tastes but in good physical 
health, passed through my hands and over my body in the course 
of a month which I remember as one distinguished by some rather 
unusual episodes; and then came the day when I was dispatched to 
the home of a man, also a sodomite, whose buggeries were dis- 
tinguished by details I simply must not pass over. And you'll be 
all the more interested in them when I tell you that this individual 
is our own Noirceuil, who’s just left us for a few days. He'll be 
back by the time I’ve completed my narrative; not that he would 
be disinclined to listen to such adventures. But he already knows 
mine by heart. 

Through an incredible excess of debauchery altogether worthy 
of the engaging individual you all know and with whom I shall 
perhaps be able to make one or two of you a little better acquainted, 
Noirceuil liked to have his wife be witness to his libertinage, to 
have her collaborate in it, and then to subject her to it. I should 
remark that Noirceuil, when we first met, thought I was a maid, and 


136 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


that he wished to deal only with girls who were virginal, at least in 
that sector. 

Madame de Noirceuil was a very gracious and gentle woman 
and she could not have been beyond twenty years old. Given at a 
very tender age to her husband, he a man of about forty and of a 
libertinage which simply knew no limits, I leave you to suppose for 
yourselves what this appealing creature must have had to put up 
with since the first day she became the slave of that roué. Husband 
and wife were in the boudoir when I entered; a moment after my 
arrival, Noirceuil rang, and two lads of seventeen and eighteen 
came in by another door. They were nearly naked. 

‘My dear, I have been given to understand that you possess 
the world’s most splendid ass,”” Noirceuil said to me once the com- 
pany was assembled. “‘Madame,” he continued, addressing his wife, 
‘‘do please have the kindness to unveil this marvel.” 

“Oh, indeed, Monsieur de Noirceuil,” replied that poor little 

woman, all confused and ashamed, “the things you demand of 
me....” 
‘They are of an eminent simplicity, Madame; it’s strange, one 
would suppose you’d have become accustomed to them, since you’ve 
been performing them for quite some time now. Your attitude 
mystifies me. Does not « wife have her duties? and do I not allow 
you the amplest opportunities to fulfill them? Passing strange, so I 
think, that as yet you have not taken a rational approach to the 
matter.” 

“Oh, I never shall!” 

‘So much the worse for you; when one is under unavoidable 
obligation to do some particular thing, a hundred times better to 
do it with a good grace <han turn it into a daily torture. But that is 
your own affair. Will you, Madame, promptly attend to mine: 
unclothe this child.” 

Out of sympathy for the poor woman, to spare her needless 
affliction, I was about to take off my clothes myself when Noirceuil, 
interceding, bade me stop and, raising a threatening hand to his 
wife, left her no choice but to obey. While his wife proceeded with 
her task, Noirceuil, the object of his two comrades’ affectionate 
by-play, used both hands to excite them; in return, one youth 
massaged his prick, the other stimulated his asshole. As soon as I 


Juliette & 137 


am naked, Noirceuil has his wife steer my ass toward him: she 
holds my buttocks for him to kiss, and kiss them he does, with 
surpassing lewdness; next, he has the two lads stripped—stripped 
‘by Madame de Noirceuil who, once she has collected and folded the 
clothing lying on the floor, takes off her own. Noirceuil, naked also, 
thus finds himself in the center of a group comprised of two attrac- 
tive women and a pair of pretty boys. At this stage indifferent to 
the pricks and cunts which are there displayed and very available, 
he concentrates upon ministering to his favorite altar, masculine 
and feminine buttocks alike receive this effusion of wholehearted 
homage, and I doubt whether behinds were ever more lasciviously 
kissed. The rascal arranged us in many different ways, sometimes 
placed a boy atop a woman so as to create powerful and luxurious 
contrasts. Sufficiently aroused, he finally orders his wife to stretch 
me belly down upon the boudoir’s couch and herself to steady his 
prick along its course into my entrails; first, however, he has her 
prepare his entry by tonguing my vent. As you know, Noirceuil has 
a prick measuring seven inches around, in length it exceeds eleven; 
"twas hence not without excruciating difficulty I managed to in- 
corporate it: but thanks to much determination and the deft assist- 
ance furnished by his wife, he buries himself up to the height of his 
balls. Meanwhile, now the prick of one acolyte, now that of the 
other disappeared into his own ass. Then, placing his wife beside me 
and in an identical posture, the libertine bade his youthful aides 
subject her to the same lubricious exercising he was giving me; one 
prick lying idle, Noirceuil grabbed it and, the while embuggering 
me, stuffed it into the delicate anus of his gentle helpmeet. There 
was a moment when she strove to resist—but, reaching his hand 
forward, the cruel husband brought her immediately to heel. 

“Excellent,” says he contentedly once the whole complex opera- 
tion is under way, “what more could I ask? My ass is being fucked, 
I’m fucking the ass of a virgin, I’ve got someone fucking my wife’s. 
Indeed, unto my pleasure now nothing wants.” 

“Oh, Sir!” groans the libertine’s conscience-stricken lady, “‘do 
you then derive it from my despair ?”’ 

‘I do, Madame, and in significant measure. You know me to 
be frank in these matters and so you will believe me when I affirm 


138 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


that my enjoyment would be far less were you any more willing to 
comply with it.” 

“Shameless man!” 

“Bless my soul, yes, a faithless, godless, unprincipled, un- 
scrupulous man, that is to say, a frightful fellow, I don’t deny it. 
Say on, say on, sweet nightingale, sing thy invectives in my ear; 
doth she realize how these feminine plaints, as though possessing a 
very magic, steel my prick and speed my discharge? Juliette, hold 
steady there, be firm, squeeze a little: it flows.” 

And, fucking, fucked, watching fuck, into the depths of my 
bowels the thrice-happy rascal hurls his thunderbolt. The entire 
company discharges, the knot of convulsing participants unties it- 
self; but Noirceuil, the avid Noirceuil, ever the tyrant to his wife, 
Noirceuil, who, to arouse himself afresh, already feels in need of 
imposing a further vexation, this Noirceuil inquires, “Madame is 
ready to proceed to the next item on the program?” 

“Is there then some divine necessity that requires you forever 
to repeat this execrable—” 

“A divine necessity, Madame, precisely. My happiness decrees 
it.” 

And the infamous Noirceuil, having his wife lie full length 
upon the couch, summons me, has me straddle her, and deposit in 
her open mouth the fuck he has lately injected into my ass. Obliged 
to obey, I unloose a generous load and, I admit, not without a little 
tremor of wickedness ] gaze down to see virtue thus so cruelly 
humiliated by vice; the woebegone lady gobbles up the soup and had 
she not swallowed everv drop away, I dare say her husband might 
have strangled her. 

’Twas from witnessing this outrage that the unkind husband, 
much inspirited, discovered the strength to commit still others. In 
position once again, Madame de Noirceuil’s ass was successively 
sounded by her husban«l’s prick and by those of his gallant young 
friends. You cannot ima zine the speed those three sodomites worked 
with, one leaping to the breach, thrusting, retiring, to be replaced 
in a flash by another ard he the next instant by the third, and so 
was waged the war whilst Noirceuil fingered my buttocks. After 
this, his narrowed eyes trained upon his wife’s slightly parted 
buttocks, Noirceuil embuggered each of the youths. While bum- 


Juliette & 139 


stuffing the first of them, he enjoined the second and me to lay 
hands upon his wife’s buttocks, he to fist one and I the other, and 
vigorously to knead, to worry those richly fleshed half-spheres, and 
whenever Noirceuil chanced to discharge into the one or the other 
of those boys’ behinds, he’d straightway have his fuck decanted 
into the mouth of his unfortunate wife. 

And the tempo of these infamies increased apace; Noirceuil 
promised two Jouis to whoever of us three most successfully teased 
the victim: the rules of the game admitted blows of the fist, kicks, 
bites, slaps, pinches, indeed, there were hardly any rules at all; and 
the scoundrel, exhorting us to play fiercely, frigged himself while 
observing the contest. There’s no imagining the tricks those lads 
and I invented; we only left off our practical jokes when Madame 
de Noirceuil lost consciousness. Then, approaching Noirceuil, who 
was all afire, we environed him with our asses and rubbed his 
fuming prick upon the ill-starred lady’s bruised and lacerated body. 
Next, Noirceuil turned me over to his tireless boys: now one of 
them would ass-fuck me while the other tendered me his prick to 
suck, and riow, sandwiched between the twd of them, I sometimes 
had both their tools wedged in my cunt, or, at other times, I 
simultaneously entrapped one prick in my anus and the other in my 
vulva. 

We were in the midst of working these wonders when, I re- 
member, Noirceuil, reluctant to see a single one of my orifices va- 
cant, stabbed his member into my mouth and there let fly with his 
final discharge while my cunt and bowels were washed by the two 
little pederasts’ exhalations; the four of us went off all at once: 
great God, never have I been rent by such pleasures. 

My looks and my evil little aptitudes had taken Noirceuil’s 
fancy, he invited me to stay to supper with his two young playmates. 
We ate in charming surroundings; the table was served only by 
Madame de Noirceuil, all unclad, whom her husband promised a 
scene that would outdo the recent one if she failed to perform 
suitably her menial chores. 

Noirceuil, of course, is a wit. You'll agree that where it comes 
to constructing rational bases to one’s irrational extravagances, the 
man has few peers. I’d thought to hazard some reproaches for his 


140 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


comportment toward his wife: “Truly,” said I, “tis rare, the 
injustice you subject that poor creature to... .” 

‘Rare? Why, I’m not so sure. But as for the injustice, you're 
quite right,” he replied. “What she has to put up with is dreadfully 
unjust—but only from her point of view. From mine, I assure you, 
nothing could be more just, the proof thereof is that nothing so 
delights me as what I wreak upon her. There are two sides to every 
passion, Juliette: seen from the side of the victim upon whom pres- 
sure is brought to bear, the passion appears unjust; whereas, do you 
know, to him who applies the pressure, his passion is the justest 
thing imaginable. When the passions speak, unjust as it may sound 
to him who is going to have to suffer, their voice is nonetheless that 
of Nature; from no one, from nowhere but Nature have we re- 
ceived these passions; nothing but Nature’s energy inspires them 
in us; and yet, they make us commit injustices, Dut these injustices 
are in Nature necessary; and Nature’s laws, whose motivations may 
escape us but whose mechanical workings are plainly accessible to 
the alerted understanding, betray a vicious content which is at least 
the equal of their virtuous content. He amongst us who has no 
innate propensity for virtue, what else is he to do but blindly submit 
to the hand of a tyrant, knowing full well that this hand is Nature’s 
and that he is the being she has delegated to do ill in order that the 
harmonious scheme be preserved.” 

“But,” I inquired of the black-hearted libertine, “when the de- 
lirium in you has abated, do you not sense some subtle, some obscure 
virtuous impulses—which, were you to obey them, would without 
fail incline you in the direction of good?” 

‘Yes,’ Noirceuil admitted, ‘I do occasionally sense impulses 
of that sort. The storm of passion rages, then subsides, and in the 
ensuing calm they are sometimes engendered, and ’tis a strange 
thing. However, I think ~ can account for it in this way. 

“‘T pause, I reflect. Is it really virtue that has just clashed with 
the vice in me? and, supposing it is virtue, ought I to yield and do 
its bidding? To resolve the question, and to resolve it impartially, 
I undertake to put my mind in a state of completest possible calm 
so as to prevent myself from favoring either of the contending 
parties, and then I ask myself: what is virtue? If I find that it has 
some real existence, I wi'l go on to analyze that existence; and if it 


Juliette & 141 


seems to me preferable to vicious existence, there’s a bare chance 
I'll adopt it for myself. Meditating, I thus observe that by the title 
of virtue one honors all the various manners or modes of being by 
means of which a given creature, setting his own pleasures and 
interests aside, dedicates himself primarily to furthering the happi- 
ness of society: whence it results that, to be virtuous, I must re- 
nounce everything pertaining to my own self and welfare so as 
from there on to be concerned exclusively with the welfare of 
others; and this I must do in behalf of people who most certainly 
would never do the same for me; but even were they to, would that 
suffice as a reason why I should necessarily have to act like them if 
at the same time I discovered that every disposition in my being 
urged me against assuming such a manner or mode of existing? If, 
for that matter, if you call virtue that which is helpful to society, 
by narrowing the definition one must give the same name to that 
which serves one’s own interests, whence it will come out that 
individual virtue is often the very opposite of social virtue, for the 
individual’s interests are nearly always opposed to society’s; thus, 
negatives enshroud the discussion, and virtue, purely arbitrary, 
ceases to have any positive aspect. Returning to the cause of the 
conflict I sense when I lean toward vice, once well convinced that 
virtue lacks any real existence, I’ll easily discover that it is not 
virtue which is struggling to make itself heard in me, but that this 
faint voice which now and then pipes up for a brief interval is no 
other than that of education and prejudice. This much established, 
I proceed to compare the pleasures vice and virtue procure; I start 
with virtue, I sample it, savor it thoughtfully, thoroughly, critically. 
How dull, how vapid! how tasteless, how bland! it leaves me cold, 
nothing moves me in this, nothing stirs me, virtue makes me listless, 
it bores me; looking more closely at the matter, I’ perceive that all 
the pleasure has gone to him I have served and, in return, for 
reward, I have nothing but his distant and aloof gratitude. Now, I 
wonder: is this pleasure? And what a difference between this virtu- 
ous exercise and the next one of vice! How my senses, my nerves are 
brought alive, how my organs bestir themselves! I have just to 
caress the mere thought of the misdemeanor I am plotting and lo! 
the divine sap starts up and rushes through my veins, I am all afire, 
fever assails me; the thought hurls me into ecstasy, a delicious illu-

sion spreads aureate across the whole landscape of this world I am 
about to conquer through a crime; in its premeditation I voluptuate, 
it transports me; all its ramifications come one by one under my 
avid scrutiny, I wax drunk apon the spectacle; ’tis a new life surging 
in me, a new soul animates me; my mind is blended in pleasure, 
identifies with it, and if now there is yet breath in me, ’tis for none 
but the sake of sweet lust I live.”’ 

‘““Monsieur,” I said to this libertine whose discourse, I admit, 
inflamed me extraordinarily and with whom I was moved to quarrel 
only insofar as, by seeming unconvinced, I might spur him to say 
on, ‘“‘ah, Monsieur, to refuse an existence to virtue is, so it seems to 
me, to hasten with undue dispatch toward the objective and per- 
haps to incur the danger of going astray by paying too scant atten- 
tion to principles, those guideposts which are there to lead us 
regularly along toward a consequential irregularity.” 

“Why,” replied Noirceuil, ‘‘as you like. We'll reason more 
methodically then: your remarks announce that you are framed ina 
way to understand; I much delight in conversations with inter- 
locutors of your stripe. 

“In all of life’s events,’’ he went on, “‘at least, in all those 
wherein we have freedom to exercise choice, we experience two im- 
pressions or, if you prefer, two inspirations: one invites us to do 
what men call good—and to be virtuous—the other to elect what 
they call evil—or vice. What we must examine is this conflict; we 
must find out why we are of two minds and hesitate. There would 
be no hesitation, the law-abiding citizen assures us, were it not 
for our passions; they hold in check those impulsions to virtue 
which, ‘he reckons, Nature ingrained in our souls: master your 
passions and you'll hesitate no more. But how has he come to sup- 
pose, this righteous man who addresses me, that the passions are the 
effects only of these latter wicked inspirations, and that virtues are 
always the effects of the former.? what incontrovertible evidence has 
he to prove his hypothesis? To discover the truth, to determine to 
which of these two warring sentiments there does indeed belong the 
priority which is to decide the character of my behavior (for one 
may be sure that of the two voices, the one which speaks first to me 
is that which will speak loudest and which I must heed, considering 
it an authentic because immediate, spontaneous inspiration of 


Juliette & 143 


Nature, whereas the other voice only corrupts and distorts Nature’s 
message to me); to recognize this primacy, I say, I examine not 
separate peoples, for national customs have denatured their virtues, 
but I observe the entire mass of mankind. I study the hearts of men, 
of savages first, then of civilized beings: where better than in this 
book shall I learn whether ’tis to vice or virtue I ought to give 
my preference, and which of these two inspirations can rightly 
claim ascendancy over the other. Now, opening my investigation, 
I first encounter the patent opposition between self-interest and 
general; I see that if a man prefers, to his own, the general well- 
being and if, consequently, he is virtuous, he is bound to be very 
unhappy his whole life long; and that if, on the other hand, he 
allows his personal interest a greater importance than the com- 
monweal, he is perfectly happy, provided the laws of society leave 
him in peace. But the laws of society have nothing to do with 
Nature, are very foreign to her; hence, they should be accorded 
no weight or place at all in our investigation; which investigation, 
the laws having been eliminated from the picture, ought then in- 
fallibly to demonstrate man happier in vice than in virtue, whence 
I shall conclude that, pre-eminence belonging to the stronger 
impulse, to, that is to say, the impulse leading to happiness, this 
impulse must incontrovertibly be natural and the contrary impulse, 
leading to misery, must with equal certainty be unnatural; it is thus 
demonstrated that, as a human sentiment, virtue is not by any 
means spontaneous or naturally sanctioned; it is rather nothing 
but the sacrifice the obligation to live in society squeezes out of a 
man, an infernal enforced sacrifice he makes to. considerations the 
observation whereof will bring him, in return, a certain minimal 
pittance of happiness, this in some sort to offset his privations. And 
so, it is for each man to choose: either the vicious inspiration which, 
most clearly and most decidedly, is that which comes from Nature 
but which, in the light of human legislation, may perhaps not 
procure him an unmitigated happiness, may perhaps bring him 
somewhat less than he may properly expect; or the factitious way 
of virtue that is in no wise natural but which, constraining him to 
forego certain things, by means of others will perhaps recompense 
him to some extent for the cruelty he must inflict upon himself when 
in his own heart he murders the first inspiration. And in my view 


144 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the value of the virtuous sentiment further deteriorates when I 
remember not only that it is not a primary natural impulse, but that, 
by definition, it is a low, base impulse, that it stinks of commerce: 
I give unto you in order that I may obtain from you in exchange; 
whence you do plainly see: that vice is eminently inherent in us and 
it is so invariably Nature’s most fundamental commandment, the 
key to her operation in us, that the noblest of all virtues when 
subjected to analysis reveals itself but consummate selfishness and 
thus a vice. And so I say unto you that all is vice in man; vice alone 
is therefore the essence of his nature and of his constitution. Vicious 
is he when above the interest of others he sets his own; and vicious 
still and yet as much when he lies in the very bosom of virtue, since 
this virtue, this sacrifice cf his passions, is in him nothing else than 
indulgence of his pride, ither that or the desire to purchase for 
himself a draught of happiness more mildly brewed than the potent 
happiness he drinks while on the road to crime. But willy-nilly and 
by whatever shifts, ’tis forever his happiness he seeks, never is he 
concerned for anything else; absurd it is to propose that there be 
any such thing as disinterested virtue whose object would be to do 
good without a motive: this virtue is illusory. You may rest assured 
that man does not pracxice virtue save for a purpose, and that 
is the advantage he hope: to reap therefrom, or the gratitude that 
puts others in his debt. I'll not listen to that prattle about virtues 
ingrained in temperament, as elements of character; these are as 
self-seeking as the others bred of calculation, since he in whom 
they find expression has no merit beyond giving his heart over to 
the sentiment that cheers him most. Analyze whatever splendid 
deed you wish and see if you do not always recognize some motive 
of self-interest there. The vicious individual labors toward the 
same end, but less deceitfully, and unashamedly, and is more to 
be esteemed, surely, for this forthrightness of his; he’d attain 
that end, otherwise anc. far more surely than his underhanded 
adversary, were it not for the law; but these laws are odious 
since, eternally encroaching upon the territories of possible indi- 
vidual happiness in the name of safeguarding the general happiness, 
they take away infinitely more than they confer. From this defini- 
tion you may now induce, as consequence, that since virtue in man 
is only the second and subsidiary impulse existing in him, apart 


Juliette & 145 


from and above all others is the will to achieve his happiness 
at the expense of whomsoever it may be; that since the impulse 
which clashes with, or counteracts, or thwarts, or diverts the 
passions is no better than a pusillanimous wish to buy the same 
happiness at a cheaper price, that is, at a minimum of sacrifice 
and without risking the rope; that since virtue, when rightly 
apprehended, shows itself to be no more than meek slavish con- 
formance to the laws which, varying from one climate to the next, 
effectively deny any consistent and objective existence to this virtue, 
one cannot have anything but the completest scorn and the most 
thoroughgoing hatred for this virtue; and the best one can do 
nowadays is to resolve under no circumstancesyto adopt this much 
inflated and highly recommended scheme of being and conduct 
fabricated by local ordinances, superstitious and sickly tempera- 
ments, the vile, mean, shrewd way of the wretched, which, if we 
elect it, must surely make us all the more unhappy in as much as 
it is impossible, once a man has engaged himself in this low and 
shameful traffic, to extricate himself therefrom: live virtuously ? 
do so if you are ill or a fool, ’tis the fool’s solution and the grave 
of the debilitated. 

“I know the arguments sometimes advanced in favor of 
virtue: ’tis of such beauty that even the wicked are all confounded 
at the sight, and its radiance makes them respect it. Do not, 
Juliette, be the dupe of this sophistry. If the wicked respect virtue, 
tis because virtue serves them, because they avail themselves 
usefully of it; only the laws’ authority disturbs the excellent rela- 
tions between wickedness and goodness, for virtue never resorts 
to physical violence. "Tis never the virtuous man who resists the 
criminal man’s passions; ’tis a very vicious man who contrives to 
thwart them because, both having the same interests, the two men 
are in competition and must obligatorily clash and hurt each other 
in the course of their operations; whilst, in his dealings with the 
virtuous man, the criminal never has such controversies. Altogether 
possible that they do not agree over principles; but their discord 
is pacific, in their actions they are able to avoid giving each other 
hurt; the wicked one’s passions, on the contrary, requiring nothing 
but imperious domination, content with nothing less, everywhere 
and continually run headlong into those of his counterpart, and 


146 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


there must be perpetual strife between them. The homage the 
villain renders to virtue is token, once again, of sheer selfishness: 
‘tis not an idol he bows worshipfully down before; no, virtue offers 
him the opportunity to er.joy himself in peace, and this the liber- 
tine prizes. But, they will sometimes tell you, he who adores virtue 
takes wonderful pleasure therein; doubtless; any kind of madness 
can afford a little; it’s not the pleasure-taking I deny, I simply 
maintain that so long as virtue procures pleasure, not only is it 
vicious, as I have shown, but it is weak, and when I have a choice 
between two vicious pleasure-takings, do you suppose I’ll select the 
less intense ? 

‘The degree of violence to which one is moved alone charac- 
terizes the éssence of pleasure. He who is only to a mediocre 
extent agitated by a passion can never be as happy as he who is 
rent by a grandiose passion; and consider how vast it is, the 
emotional difference between pleasures afforded by virtue and 
by vice! He who declares how very happy he was to deliver over 
to an heir, let us say, the million which was privily put into his 
trusteeship, can this personage conceivably claim that the amount 
of happiness he has experienced is anything like as great as the 
joy that would be known to another who devoured that million 
after having discreetly liquidated the beneficiary? Regardless of 
how dominant the position of the idea of happiness in our way of 
thinking, it is however only through realities that it inflames our 
imagination, and however much his good deed may flatter your 
honest man’s imagination, his ideal happiness has most assuredly 
not afforded his real self as many piquant sensations as he could 
have experienced from the reiterated and manifold delights a 
victim’s million would physically have procured him. But the 
robbery—but the murder of the heir, do you say, will spoil his 
happiness? Not at all; granted a lucid mind and a firm doctrine, 
robberies and murders can impair happiness only in as much as 
they excite remorse; but: the man who has ripened his philosophy, 
who is strong in his principles, he who has entirely vanquished the 
vexing and baneful leftovers of the past, impeded by nothing, he 
will relish an unalloyed pleasure; and the difference between our 
two individuals consists in this: that over and over again in the 
course of his whole life the first will be unable to prevent himself 


Juliette 147 


from wondering, deeply distressed: Ah! that million, would it not 
have given me much pleasure? whilst the other, tranquil, will never 
once pause to ask: Indeed, why ever did I take it? The virtuous 
act could thus give rise to regrets, whereas the wicked, being what 
it is, must necessarily preclude them. To be brief, the only hap- 
piness virtue procures is fancied and fantastical; there is no veri- 
table felicity other than personal, and virtue flatters not one of the 
senses. Is it by any means, I ask you, to virtue that we attach 
position, fame, honors, wealth? do we not every day behold the 
wicked prosper exceedingly, and the good languish in chains? 
To expect to see virtue rewarded in another world, this folly is 
no longer pardonable. To what end then, this worship of a false— 
of a tyrannical—of an almost egoistical, an always vicious divinity 
(vicious, I repeat, and I have proven why) who has nothing to 
spare now for those who serve him and who but promises impos- 
sible or fictitious payments deferred to the future ? Need I mention, 
moreover, the danger in wishing to be virtuous in a very corrupt 
age? Thus to isolate oneself from others is to withhold from them 
the happiness they await from virtue, and, quite absolutely, better 
to be vicious along with everyone else than to be a good man alone. 
‘So great is the discrepancy between the manner in which we do 
live and the other in which we ought, that he who spurns what is 
done and would have nought but what should be done,’ says 
Machiavelli, ‘seeks rather his undoing than his salvation, and 
hence it is that a man who professes to be entirely good in the 
midst of such a host of others who are not, must shortly perish.’ 
If there be virtuous wretches, have a care lest, mistakenly sur- 
prised to find this trait in them, we be deceived by it: fearfully 
reduced, they may be allowed to take what pride they can in the 
pathetic enjoyment of virtue, it perhaps consoles them, there you 
have their secret.” 

During this learned dissertation, Madame de Noirceuil and 
the two Ganymedes had fallen asleep. 

Noirceuil glanced their way. ‘‘Feeble-minded creatures,” he 
murmured; “pleasure-machines, sufficient to our purposes, but, 
truly, their appalling insensibility depresses me.’’ His eyes now 
rested meditatively upon me. “You, Juliette, your subtler mind 
conceives me, understands me, yes, anticipates me, I relish your 


148 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


company. And,” he added, further narrowing his eyes, ‘‘you can- 
not hide it: you are in love with evil.” 

I trembled. “I am, Monsieur, I am, very much so. It—it 
dazzles me, it—”’ 

“You will go far, my child. I am fond of you. I should like 
to see more of you.” 

‘Your sentiments flatter me, Monsieur, I might even venture 
to say that I merit them, so straitly do mine conform to your. 
... IT have had some education, ’twas at a convent that my mind 
was trained by a friend. Alas, Sir, my birth is not mean, it ought 
to have guaranteed me against the humiliation I am in now by 
hard circumstance.” 

And thereupon I recounted my story to Noirceuil. 

“Juliette,” said he after having heard me out, listening to 
every detail with keen attention, “I am sorely distressed by all this 
you tell me.” 

‘“Why so?” 

“Why? Because I knew your father. I am the cause of his 
bankruptcy, ’twas I who ruined him. There was a moment when 
I was in control of his entire fortune, I had the choice of doubling 
it for him or dispossessing him utterly; having consulted my prin- 
ciples, I found I had, indeed, no choice at all but to prefer my 
welfare to his. He diecl a pauper; and I have an income of three 
hundred thousand pounds a year. After all you have said, I ought 
of course to make reparation to you, since if you have suffered 
adversity ‘tis owing to my crimes; but such a gesture would be 
virtuous. Do you see, I have a very great horror of virtue, I could 
never indulge in such a thing. I fear that past events have raised 
impenetrable barriers between us two; I regret it, but it looks as 
‘though our acquaintance were come to its term.” 

‘““Execrable man!” I cried, ‘‘however much I am the victim of 
your vices, I adore them . . . yes, I adore your principles—” 

“Oh, Juliette, there is yet more to be told,” he said in a quiet 
tone. 
“I want to hear everything.” 
“Your father... vour mother. ... 
Yes?” 

‘Their existence was a threat to me. To avoid betrayal, I 


” 


Juliette & 149 


had to sacrifice them. They went in swift succession to the grave. 
That could be ascribed to a poison . . . they once dined at my 
home—” 

A sudden quaking laid hold of me, to the core of me I shud- 
dered; but straightway upon Noirceuil I bent a stare, the phleg- 
matic, apathetic stare of the wickedness with which, in spite of me, 
Nature was at once burning and freezing my heart: 

“Monster,” I repeated in a thickened voice, and speaking 
slowly, “thou art an abomination, I love thee.” 

“The murderer of your parents?” 

“Can that matter to me? Sensations are my means for judging 
everything; none were stimulated in me by, those persons of whom 
your crimes have rid me forever, and to hear you confess what 
you have done sets me all afire, transports me .. . ah, I may become 
delirious. ...” 

“Charming creature,” said Noirceuil, “your naiveté, the 
candid purity of your soul, everything about you conspires against 
my principles; I am going to violate them and keep you by me, 
Juliette, Pl not part with you. You shall not return to Duvergier, 
I'll not hear of it.” 

“But, Monsieur—your lady ?” 

“She'll be no better than your slave, you'll reign over my 
household, everyone in it will be under your orders, you shall have 
but to give them and be obeyed. Crime does indeed hold a mighty 
sway over my soul: whatever, whoever bears the evil brand is dear 
unto me. Nature made me to love it; abhorring virtue, despite 
myself I fall ever and ever down to my knees before crime and 
infamy. Oh, Juliette . . . Juliette, come hither, I’m hard, show 
me your beauteous ass—slut, give me that ass of yours, I’m of a 
great mind to fuck it, I’m going to expire from the pleasure of 
imagining my lust is making a victim of my greed’s offspring.” 

I approached him, bidding him have furiously at me. “Yes, 
Noirceuil, fuck me, fuck me, you swine, I adore the idea of whoring 
to the assassin of my kin. Eh, come bugger-fuck that hole, wring 
the fuck out of my cunt, for tears I’m in no mood to spill: fuck, 
that’s the only homage I’m disposed to offer to the loathsome 
ashes of the family you destroyed.” 

We waked the acolytes; sodomizing me, Noirceuil caused 


150 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


himself to be bum-stuffed and, having had his wife clamber atop 
me and deploy her buttocks, he bit and chewed them and gnawed 
and worried them and slapped them too, and all that with such 
vehemence that the poor creature’s hind parts were all bloodied 
before Noirceuil was done shedding his fuck. 


As soon as I was installed in his town house, Noirceuil ex- 
pressed his reluctance to have me venture out of it and would 
not even consent to let me go recover the effects I'd left at 
Duvergier’s; on the morrow he presented me to his domestics, to 
his acquaintances, sayinyx I was a cousin, and from then on I was 
entrusted with the direction of the house. 

However, I could not resist seizing the first occasion to pay 
a quick visit to my former employer; indeed, I had no intention 
of cutting myself off al:ogether from her, but neither did I think 
it prudent policy to seem too eager to see her. 

‘“‘My dear Juliette!” cried Duvergier as soon as she clapped 
eyes on me, “how glad I am to have you back! Come in, do, I’ve 
been so impatient, for I've a thousand things to talk to you about.” 

We encloseted ourselves in her apartment; she embraced me 
with utmost cordiality and congratulated me upon having had the 
luck to please so weal::hy a man as Noirceuil; ‘“‘And now,” said 
she, “‘listen to me, my dear. 

“I don’t know just how you view your new situation; but I 
should think it a most unfortunate mistake were you to go and 
suppose that in your present position of a kept whore you need in 
any wise be bound by some exaggerated fidelity to a man who 
converses with seven o:: eight hundred women each year. However 
rich a man may be, however liberal to us, we never owe him any- 
thing in return, thanks least of all; for ’tis in his own behalf he 
toils even if he bestows the whole treasure of the Indies upon us. 
He showers us with gold; why? either because of the pride he 
takes in having us all to himself, or because of the jealousy that 
spurs him to lavish money so that no one else will share in the 
object of his affections; but, Juliette, I ask you, do any man’s 
extravagances ever warrant our catering to his folly? Granted 
that it must grieve a man to see us in the arms of another; does 


Juliette & 151 


it follow that we must suffer inconvenience simply to spare him 
the sight ? I am willing to go farther: though one loves to the point 
of madness the man one lives with, whether as his wife or as his 
most cherished mistress, it would be nonetheless completest ab- 
surdity to chain oneself gratuitously to his bedpost. One can fuck 
every day in every conceivable manner without diminishing the 
sentiments of the heart, and without their help. "Tis the most 
commonplace thing in the world, to love one man to distraction 
and to fuck frenziedly with another; you don’t give your heart 
to him, just your body. The most extensive, the most intensive, and 
the most oft-repeated riots of libertinage, having no connection 
whatever with love, cannot possibly betray its delicacy. In what 
consists the wrong one does a man whom one outrages by prosti- 
tuting oneself to somebody else? You'll agree with me that at the 
very most ’tis a moral affront; and so you've but to take the 
greatest precautions to prevent him from ever finding your infi- 
delity out; and now what can he complain of? Indeed, one may 
fairly say that a marvelously well-behaved woman who nonetheless 
lets some suspicions take root against her, whether these sus- 
picions be bred of imprudence or of calumnies, will be, even were 
she a perfect saint for virtue, infinitely guiltier in the view of the 
man who loves her than she who, getting herself fucked nigh to 
death from dawn to dark, was clever enough to attract no atten- 
tion to her doings. Yes, and I shan’t have it end there, I'll assert 
that a woman, however sound her reasons for handling a man 
gingerly and with thoughtfulness, yea, even for worshiping him, 
can give another not only her body but her heart too; she may 
even while loving one man a great deal also love a great deal the 
person with whom she chances to lie; this then is fickleness, and 
to my consideration nothing more nicely sorts with grand passions 
than fickleness. There are two manners of loving a man: morally 
and physically. A woman can morally idolize her husband and 
physically and momentarily love the young blade who pays her 
court; she can cavort with him without in any sense or degree 
offending the moral sentiments she entertains for and owes him 
she worships: every individual of our sex who is of a different 
opinion is an idiot who is steering nowhere but toward disaster. 
A mettlesome-spirited woman, how can you expect her to possibly 


152 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


subsist, or rather avoid starving, upon the caresses of only one 
man? The thing is unthinkable; and thus you discover Nature in 
perpetual conflict with your alleged precepts of constancy and 
fidelity. Now tell me, if you please, what importance can be 
ascribed by any right-thinking man to a sentiment that is in neces- 
sary and unending contradiction with Nature? A man ridiculous 
enough to demand that a woman never give herself to anyone 
except himself would be behaving quite as absurdly as he who 
would not tolerate his.mistress or wife ever once dining with some- 
one else; not only would such an attitude be downright queer, it 
would be tyrannical; for by what right, being incapable of satisfy- 
ing the woman single-handed, can he require that this woman suffer 
and not seek to console herself by whatever means at her disposal ? 
Oh, there is here a selfishness, an incredible harshness, a monstrous 
ungenerosity, and the very instant a woman detects such traits in 
him who claims to love her, that ought to suffice to make her 
decide there and then to compensate herself for the dreadful 
circumstances to which her jailer wishes to reduce her. But if, in 
that other case, only interest or convenience attaches a woman to 
a man, her motive will be all the stronger in no wise to curb either 
her penchants or her clesires: she is under no obligation to cede 
to her keeper save when he pays for her services, and while she 
does definitely owe him the use of her body when he contracts for 
it, before the bargain is struck and after she has fulfilled her part 
of it, she is free, the rest of her hours are hers to employ as she 
likes, and it is then that, business attended to, she may devote 
‘herself to pleasure and the inclinations of her heart; and why 
should she not, since her only commitment to her keeper is physical ? 
The paying lover, or tie husband, must perfectly well understand 
that he cannot exact from the object of his doting those feelings 
of the heart which obviously cannot be bought; these gentlemen 
are too intelligent not to know what is and what is not for sale. 
And therefore, provided the woman who is in the hire of either 
or, as the case may be, of both men cooperates in the satisfaction 
of their desires, they would pass for lunatics if they were to demand 
more of her. For, to frame it succinctly, from a woman a husband 
or a lover expects not virtue but the appearance of virtue. Put 
case she fucketh not with others, but seemeth to, then she’s lost; 


Juliette & 153 


let her fuck a whole empire to death, but if she be not seen, lo! 
‘tis there a reputable lady."* There exist examples enough to 
illustrate my assertions, Juliette; you have chosen a good moment 
to visit me, and I shall employ the occasion to convince you; wait- 
ing in the next room I’ve some fifteen women whom I’m going to 
pack off to be fucked somewhere outside town; look closely at 
them, each has her story. But if I am committing a grave im- 
prudence in talking about them and in allowing them to be seen, 
I do it for your sake, and would not for someone else’s.”” 

So saying, Duvergier slid aside a little secret panel which 
exposed the eritire room to our view without ourselves being 
visible to those within it. 

“Did I say there were fifteen ladies in the circle? Count them 
for yourself.” 

Fifteen women, all charming to behold but differently dressed, 
were indeed waiting, in silence, for the instructions they were to 
receive. 

“We'll move round from right to left,” said Duvergier, 
“beginning with that superb blonde you see there by-the fireplace. 
She is the Duchesse de Saint-Fal, whose conduct is surely not to 
be blamed; for, lovely as you must admit she is, my Lord the Duc 
cannot bear her. Although you see her here, she is nonetheless 
rumored to be of spotless virtue; her family is very jealous of its 
name, watches her closely and, were news of her activities to leak 
abroad, they’d have her confined.” 

“But,” I remarked, “these women must all run a grave risk 
by showing their presence here to one another. Might they not 
meet elsewhere? A slip of the tongue—or a little malice—” 

“Firstly,” said the matron, “they are not mutually acquainted ; 
but if later they should so become, what could one tell of another 
that she could not instantly turn against her accuser? All having 
the same concern, thus bound to discretion, there is no danger of 
denunciation; I’ve been purveying to these persons or their like 
for five and twenty years, and I've yet to hear tell of a single 
betrayal; they themselves fear no such thing. Do they look uneasy ? 
Let me continue. 


15 Prudish, God-fearing, or otherwise timorous women, make daily and confident 
use of these counsels, ‘tis for you the author intends them. 


154 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“That tall woman next to the Duchesse, she who appears to 
be about twenty and whose heavenly countenance resembles that 
of the purest virgin, she is wild about her husband; notwithstand- 
ing, she has an equally wild temperament; she pays me to put her 
in touch with youths. Would you believe it? she’s such a libertine, 
even at her age, that despite the money I am willing to spend, I 
simply cannot locate pricks big enough to satisfy her. 

‘Look at that othe- angel just to the left. She’s the daughter 
of a member of parliament; she’s clever too, and comes here on the 
sly, escorted by her governess. I doubt whether she is yet fourteen. 
I only involve her in scenes of passion where fuckery is omitted. 
Mind you, I’ve several bids of five hundred /ouis for her membrane, 
but I don’t dare. She’s waiting for a gentleman who discharges 
merely from putting his mouth in the vicinity of her ass; one thou- 
sand louis is the fee he’s offered me for leave to sink his prick 
into it. The danger being much slighter, I'll arrange the affair 
by and by. 

“That other child is thirteen years old: a little bourgeoise 
I’ve suborned. She's to marry, she adores her intended; but she’s 
had a schooling rather like your own. Yesterday, Noirceuil and I 
concluded negotiations for the sale of her antiphysical pucelage; 
he'll be here tomorrow to exploit his purchase. A young bishop 
should soon arrive, he’s contracted to loosen her up a little in 
the same part; but, you see, his device is dimensioned so modestly 
that your abundantly furnished lover will never know the difference. 

“Glance closely at that other woman, that one there. I believe 
she is twenty-six. She lives with a man who is beyond words devoted 
to her, who denies her nothing her heart desires; they've both done 
incredible things for each other; but that doesn’t prevent the 
little rascal from fucking every man in sight, it’s men she loves, 
all men, and with a rapacity that takes.one’s breath away. Formerly, 
her lover permitted her to indulge herself, if anyone’s to blame for 
the disorders she wallows in, ’tis he: she but profits from the 
examples he once set before her, and unbeknownst to him she has 
her daily fling of fuckery under my roof. 

“The pretty brunette beside her is the wife of an elderly 
individual who wedded her for love; she exhibits prodigious con- 
sideration for him, and there are few who can boast of so wonder- 


Juliette & 155 


ful a reputation for virtue. Here her patience is rewarded: she’s 
waiting for a pair of young men; later on in the day she’ll come 
back again to meet the man she loves. Of mornings she dedicates 
herself to debauchery; the longings of her heart are satisfied after 
lunch. 

“That one next to her is of an extreme piety. Notice her 
costume. The scoundrel divides her time between reading sermons, 
attending Mass, and frequenting brothels; she has a husband, he 
adores her but is powerless to change her ways. Stubborn, shrewish, 
domineering at home, she reckons all that mummery must induce 
him to forgive her the rest. The poor devil has made her a wealthy 
woman; and nonetheless she has made him the most miserable 
of men. I too have a frightful time with her, for she'll only fuck 
clerics. True, age and looks and manners matter not one whit to 
her; the whore’s happy so long as the prick in her cunt belongs to 
a man of God. 

“Over there beyond her is a kept woman who receives a wage 
of two hundred Jouis a month; she spends it here, and if her allow- 
ance were doubled she’d probably never leave my place at all. She’s 
a former pupil of mine. Her old archbishop would stake his 
emoluments that she’s chaster than the Virgin—who, by the way, 
being much worshiped by the folk of his diocese, brings in those 
same two hundred /ouis which, destined for Mary, go next to the 
prelate, then to his concubine, finally to me. All that, my Juliette, 
is how things transpire in this silly world of ours; one swims with 
the current or drowns battling it. 

“Now we come to that middle-class girl over there, she’s nine- 
teen, and tell me if you’ve ever seen a more comely creature. Her 
lover has done everything under the sun for her: he rescued her 
from poverty, settled her debts, maintains her on the finest footing ; 
if she took a fancy to the very stars, he’d attempt to steal them 
out of heaven for her, and the little whore hasn’t a single .moment 
to herself she doesn’t employ in fucking. But libertinage is not 
what guides her, no, ’tis greed: she does whatever is asked of her, 
she’ll consent to any match I make so long as she’s paid for her 
trouble, and her price is high. Is she wrong to ask all the market 
will stand? The brute I’m going to turn her over to will leave her 
bedridden for six weeks, and she knows it; but she’ll earn her ten 


156 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thousand francs this morning, and for the rest she doesn’t care 
a fig.” 

“And her lover ?” 

“Oh, she'll improvise some excuse or other, never fear. She 
slipped and fell. Or she was run down by a carriage. With that 
brain of hers, she’s clever enough to make a dunce of God Al- 
mighty. 

“That little minx there,” Duvergier continued, pointing out 
a gorgeous creature of twelve, “is a more unusual case: her mother 
sells her, they are needy folk. The two of them could, to be sure, 
find other work, they’ve even been offered it, but they refuse: only 
libertinage suits them. Cnce again it’s Noirceuil who'll have the 
first shot at that child’s asshole. 

“And now behold the triumph of conjugal love. In all the 
world there’s not a wife who cherishes her husband as that woman 
does,” Duvergier declared, indicating a creature of some twenty- 
eight years, a perfect Aphrodite. ‘Yes, she adores him, she is 
jealous too, but she cannot withstand her urges; she disguises 
herself, she’s taken for a vestal, but every week she enters the 
lists with fifteen or a score of men. 

“I consider that other one quite as attractive,” my informant 
went on, ‘‘and her position is truly extraordinary : her own husband 
prostitutes her. Mark you, he is passionately fond of her, and 
that could provide the ex lanation : he’s witness to her proceedings, 
he’s ready to pimp for his lady, but he embuggers her fucker. 

“It’s the father of that engaging and so very well-favored 
maiden who in like manner brings his child here; but he'll not have 
her fucked; anything at all may be done to her provided the two 
pucelages are left intact. He'll also be the third member of the 
party, I’m expecting him at any moment, for the man who’s to 
sport with his daughter is already here. You’d enjoy watching 
the scene, ’tis a pity you zan’t stay. There’d doubtless be a role for 
you.” 

“And what is going to happen?” 

“The father will want to thrash the man who is to lay hands 
on his child; her ravisher will decline to be whipped; pleadings, 
obstinacy : the father grovels, the other refuses and finally, catching 
up a cane, he gives the father a fierce thwacking and in the midst 


Juliette & 157 


of it squirts his fuck all over the girl’s ass. And papa? He'll creep 
over and lap up the spilled seed, then unleash his own while wrath- 
fully gnawing the buttocks of the man who, the moment before, 
was administering a beating to him.” 

“A complicated passion, upon my soul. And in it what part 
would I play?” 

“For the blows he’d sustained the father would avenge him- 
self upon you. You'd have to count on a few superficial scratches, 
a cut or two; they’d be worth one hundred Jouis.” 

“Continue, Madame, continue. You know I cannot participate 
today.” 

“Well,” said she, “only two remain. Consider now that very 
attractive person. She enjoys an annual income of over fifty thou- 
sand pounds and an excellent reputation; her taste is for women, 
notice how she ogles the others. She is also fond of buggers; and 
she is deeply in love with her husband withal. But well does she 
realize that the moral and the physical are two very distinct 
domains. She fucks her husband with the best will in the world, 
she comes here to satisfy her other needs; it is simply a matter 
of managing one’s affairs properly. 

“Finally, the last of those ladies is unwed, she has great 
pretensions, is one of our most celebrated prudes; in society, were 
a man so much as to murmur the word love within her hearing, 
I believe she'd strike him; whilst here in my little house she pays 
fortunes to get herself fucked fifty times a month. 

“How now, Juliette? Do you need further examples? Or are 
these enough to make you decide ?” 

“I think you’ve persuaded me, Madame,” I replied; “in 
future, I’ll fuck here for pleasure and profit, yes, I'll not turn up 
my nose at whatever little libidinous adventures you prepare for 
me. But I must give you fair warning: don’t put yourself to any 
trouble on my account unless, where money is concerned, a minimum 
price of fifty Jouis is acceptable to whoever wishes my services.” 

“Fifty? My dear, you'll have your fifty /ouis a throw, never 
fear,” cried Duvergier, overcome with joy. “I only wanted your 
agreement. Money? Money presents no problem. Be gentle, be 
docile, be obedient, never say no; I'll find you mountains of money.” 

Since it had grown late and I feared lest Noirceuil become 


158 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


alarmed at the length of this first promenade I'd taken, I hastened 
back to be in time for dinner, most sincerely upset at not having 
seen some of those fifteen women in action or having been able to 
participate in it with them. 

Madame de Noirceuil was not entirely unmoved to see her 
rival established in her house; the uncouth and imperious tone in 
which her husband had enjoined her to obey me contributed not a 
little to her resentment of my presence; not a day passed when she 
did not weep from sore chagrin and envy: I was incomparably 
better lodged than she, better served, better fed, more magnificently 
dressed, having a carriage to myself whereas she was scarcely 
allowed the use of her husband’s; little wonder that this woman 
developed a hatred for me. But so great was my appeal to 
Noirceuil’s intellect that, whatever her feelings, and they must 
truly have been strong, { dwelt in perfect security from the least 
of their effects. 

I hardly need stress, however, that love was not Noirceuil’s 
motive for acting in this manner. He valued my company, for in 
his eyes I represented the means to committing crimes; did he, 
what with his perfidious imagination, did he need another reason 
for keeping me by him? That villain’s disorders were faultlessly 
systematized. Every day, and nothing could have interfered with 
the ritual, Duvergier furnished him a maiden whose age, according 
to the requirements he laid down, was not to exceed fifteen nor be 
less than ten; for each of these girls he paid one hundred crowns; 
and their agreement further specified that if Noirceuil could supply 
proof positive that any one specimen was not absolutely mint, 
Duvergier must pay him twenty-five Jouis in damages and for 
breach of contract. Despite all these precautions, the example of 
my own self suggests to what an extent he could be deceived, and 
I dare say he very often was. 

This libertine session was ordinarily scheduled for every 
afternoon; we were all convoked, the two young pederasts, Ma- 
dame de Noirceuil, and I, and every day Noirceuil’s susceptible 
and hapless wife was the victim of those piquant and unusual 
practices I have described already. The children would be dismissed 
and Noirceuil and I would sup together; he usually drank himself 
into a stupor and would end up asleep in my arms. 


Juliette 159 


Now I must avow, my friends, that for a long time I’d been 
mightily eager to test Dorval’s theories in action; my fingers were 
nigh to itching from impatience; I simply had to steal at any cost. 
I had yet to determine what I could do: I didn’t doubt my abilities, 
but I needed someone to try them upon. Situated there in Noir- 
ceuil’s house, conditions would have favored a stunning per- 
formance: his confidence in me was as complete as his wealth was 
immense and his disorders extreme: I could at any time and every 
day have laid hands on ten or twelve Jouis, he’d never have noticed 
their disappearance. But by some quirk of the imagination, by 
some curious way of reckoning, thanks to some feeling I’d perhaps 
have difficulty explaining clearly, even to myself, I never wanted 
to wrong anyone as corrupt as I. It is doubtless here the old story 
of honor amongst thieves, or of mutual respect; but it was oper- 
ative in me. I had another reason also, an important one, for 
restraining myself; I wanted to steal, and I wanted my victim to 
sustain grave hurt: the idea wonderfully heated my brain. Well 
now, what crime would I be committing in plundering Noirceuil ? 
I considered his property mine: I would simply be making off 
with what I already owned; thus, robbing Noirceuil would be 
mere reappropriation, lacking the faintest trace of larceny. In 
short, had Noirceuil been a good man, I’d have bled him white; 
he was a wicked man, I respected him. In a moment or two you'll 
hear how I was unfaithful to him; you'll perhaps wonder why my 
veneration for the man did not inhibit my fuckeries; but fuckery 
is something else again, and between my principles and infidelity 
there lay not so much as a shadow of contradiction, I loved Noir- 
ceuil for his libertinage, for his mental qualities; I was not by 
any means captivated by his person, I did not consider myself so 
firmly attached to him as to be deterred from fucking anyone else 
whenever I pleased. I was ambitious, I took the longer view: 
the more men I saw, the greater my chances of finding one better 
than Norceuil. And even if that luck should not befall me, collabora- 
tion with Duvergier must necessarily be profitable; and I could not 
throw away that money in the name of a quaint chivalric sentiment 
for Norceuil in whom no manner of delicacy could in any funda- 
mental or even superficial sense exist. In observance of this scheme 
of behavior, I, as you may very well imagine, accepted an invitation 


160 °& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


I received from Duvergier several days.after the interview I de- 
scribed a little while ago. 

The party was to be given at the home of a millionaire; he 
was not prone to stint on his pleasures, it was in their weight in gold 
he recompensed those accommodating creatures who were disposed 
to satisfy his shameless whims. However extensive one’s acquaint- 
ance with the question may be, libertinage forever holds surprises in 
store for us; and there is r.o predicting to what degree it can degrade 
a man who heeds only tk.e mischievous urgings quickened by ever 
astonishing vice. 

Six of Duvergier’s most winning protégées were to accompany 
me to the house of that Croesus; but I being the most distinguished 
of the troupe, his finer attentions were concentrated upon me, and 
my companions really officiated only as priestesses in the ceremony. 

We arrived and at once we were introduced into a chamber 
hung in brown satin, a color and a material chosen, no doubt, to 
emphasize the fairness of the skin of the sultanas who were sum- 
moned there; straightwav, the woman who had led us thither bade 
us undress. She swathed me in a black and silver gauze gown, this 
costume setting me apart from the others: this tire, the divan I 
was instructed to recline pon while the others, remaining standing, 
quietly awaited orders, the special attention shown me—I was 
speedily convinced that { was to occupy a central position in the 
festivities. 

Mondor enters. He was a man of seventy, short, squat, but 
keen of eye, and libertire. He gazes around, examining my com- 
panions; he utters words of praise for each, then he comes up to 
me and pays me some of those compliments such as are to be heard 
from none but a slave trader’s lips. 

“Very well,” says he to his aide, “if these young ladies are 
ready, I believe we can get on with the job.” 

That libidinous drama was comprised of three scenes: first 
of all, whilst with moutt,, lips, and nibbling teeth I strove to rouse 
the deeply slumbering activity in Mondor, my six colleagues, 
grouped in pairs, were to strike the most suggestive sapphic poses 
for Mondor’s contemplation; no two of their attitudes were to be 
alike, they were all to keep in continual motion. Gradually, the 
three couples merged ard our six tribades, who had spent several 


Juliette & 161 


days training for the occasion, finally composed the most original 
and the most libertine configuration you could hope to imagine. We 
had already been half an hour at play and I was only beginning to 
detect a few faint hints of progress in our septuagenarian. 

“‘My angel,” said he, “I do believe these whores are putting 
the wind in my sail. Turn around. give me a sight of your cheeks, 
for were I to find myself able to perforate the noble asshole you'll 
offer up to my kisses like a good little girl, why then, without fur- 
ther ado we'd proceed to the conclusion of the affair.” 

But, swept away by optimism, Mondor had neglected to take 
Nature into account. 

They failed, the several attacks he therewith delivered, though 
they helped apprise me of what he wished to achieve. “Well,” he 
sighed at last, “it won’t do. I need further encouragement.” 

All seven of us surrounded him. To each the duenna handed 
a bundle of sturdy withes; then, one after the other, we belabored 
the wrinkled and seamed backside of that poor Mondor who, 
while being flayed by one girl, fondled the charms of the six others. 
We lashed him till blood flowed; and still no sign of success. 

“Oh Lord!” the sorry old dog groaned, “I’m apparently re- 
duced to taking desperate remedies.” 

Sweating, bleeding, breathless, the knave cast a troubled eye 
about the company. 

At that point the amiable duenna spoke up, busying herself 
applying eau de cologne to her master’s lacerated buttocks. 
“Ladies,” said she, “I am afraid there remains but one means to 
bring his Honor back to life.” 

“And what may that be?” I inquired. “For truly, Madame, 
have we not exhausted every device that would bring his Honor 
forth from slumber ?” 

“Nay, there is yet this we may attempt,” she answered. “I shall 
stretch his Honor comfortably upon this couch; you, my kind 
Juliette, kneeling before him, you will go on imparting the warmth 
of your pink mouth to my dear master’s glacial tool. You, only you 
can succeed in its resurrection, of that I am convinced. As for you 
other ladies, will you one by one step forward and perform these 
three little services: first, briskly slap his Honor’s face, then spit 
upon it, and finally fart thereupon: as soon as all six have com- 


162 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleted these exercises we may, I believe, see his Honor wonder- 
fully revived.” 

She spoke, the prescription was followed out, and I swear 
to you I am still amazed at the efficacy of these combined expedi- 
ents: in my mouth, as the treatment advanced, the balloon inflated 
until I nigh to choked on that swelling morsel. True, all went at 
great speed: those slaps, that spittle, and the farts, perfectly 
orchestrated, rained down a very tempest upon the patient; passing 
strange it was, and most entertaining, to listen to the music where- 
with the air resounded, a symphony of eructations, bass and tenor, 
the sharp percussive sounds of the blows, the flat notes of the ex- 
pectorations. Well, the sluggardly member at last woke up, as I 
say, filled out, waxed wroth, and I thought it was about to explode 
between my lips when, springing away from me, Mondor signaled 
to the duenna, and she readied everything for the finale: ’tis within 
my ass the opera is to ead. She adjusts me in the posture sodomy 
prefers; Mondor, helpecl, guided by his assistant, plunges instantly 
into the arcanum where the bugger takes his sweetest pleasures— 
but wait, there’s more tc tell; I’d fail to give an honest portrait of 
these goings-on were I :o omit the crapulous episode with which 
Mondor crowned his ecstasy. While the lecher ass-fucked me, it was 
necessary : 

1) that his governess, outfitted with a gigantine dildo, render 
him the same service; 

2) that one of the girls, crouched beneath me, cause a great 
racket and stir in my curt by sucking and licking it and blowing air 
thereinto and smacking her lips together; 

3) that two dainty asses be placed where I could fondle them 
vigorously ; 

4) and finally that two other girls, the first sitting astride me 
and bent low over my back, and the second likewise seated upon the 
first, both simultaneously shit, the former delivering a gobbet of 
excrement into his Honor’s mouth, the latter smearing another over 
his brow. 

But everyone took her turn accomplishing this last-mentioned 
task; everybody shat, zven the duenna; everybody frigged me, 
everybody donned the dildo and impaled Mondor who, over- 


Juliette & 163 


whelmed by lubricious titillations, at last darts the deplorable jets 
of his quavering lust to a good depth in my anus. 


“What is this, Madame! What is this strange tale you are 
telling us!” cried the Chevalier, suddenly interrupting Juliette. ‘‘Do 
you mean to say that the duenna shat also?” 

“She very certainly did, Sire,” our historian insisted, a hint of 
vexation in her voice, another of reproof in her glance. “I fail to 
apprehend how, with an imagination so matured as your own, 
Chevalier, you can find anything strange in that: the more worn 
and weary, the more wrinkled a woman’s ass, the more meet it is for 
such an operation; seasoning makes the salts more acrid, the vapors 
richer, the odors stronger. . . . In general, I might add, there per- 
sists a very great error in what pertains to the exhalations emanated 
from the caput mortuum of our digestions; there is nothing un- 
wholesome about them, nothing that is not altogether agreeable... 
shit-hatred is unfailingly the mark of the simpleton, that you will 
admit; but need I tell you that there is such a thing as shit-connois- 
seurship, shit-gourmandise? No habit is more easily acquired than 
mard-savoring ; eat one, delicious, eat another, no two taste exactly 
alike, but all are subtle and the effect,is somewhat that of an olive. 
By all means, yes, one must allow one’s imagination free play; but 
shit gleaned from antique and much-traveled assholes . . . ah, a 
supper for the gods, one of the culminating episodes of the libertine 
experience. .. .”” 

“Which I shall willingly undergo before very long, Madame, 
I swear it unto you,” declared the Chevalier as he complacently 
stroked a prick which the idea just broached was causing to stiffen 


horribly. 
“Whenever you please,’’Julictte replied, “and may I offer my 
own product for your delectation? Indeed, hold . . . this instant, if 


you wish; your palate’s whetted, my sphincters are stirring,” 
And the Chevalier, taking Juliette at her word, led her away 
into an adjoining cabinet whence they did not return for a good 
thirty minutes, which in all likelihood were employed to acquaint 
the Chevalier with the most voluptuous aspects of this patrician 


164 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


passion; and the Marquis devoted the same interval to harrying the 
much-weathered buttocks of the unfortunate Justine. 

The door opened; “True!” cried the Chevalier, “’tis deli- 
cious |” 

“Did you eat—?” inquired the Marquis. 

“I feasted. And gluttonously, I am afraid. There’s none left, 
my Liege.” 

“T too am surprised, Chevalier; but what strikes me as strange 

is that you'd not familiarized yourself with the practice long before 
this. Nowadays you'll not find a single child of eighteen or twenty 
who’s not had shit aplenty out of whores. But proceed, Juliette, ’tis 
very pleasant, the way you kindle our passions with your engaging 
stories and then appease them with such singular consideration and 
art.” 
“Heavenly creature,” said Mondor, drawing me into a se- 
cluded room after having dismissed the other women, “‘there is yet 
another service you may perform for me and that is the one from 
which I await my divinest pleasures. I would have you imitate your 
friends, you're to shit as did they, and to deposit here in my mouth 
both the celestial turd I pray to God you have reserved for me, and 
with that succulent viand, the fuck-gravy I injected not long ago 
into your ass.” 

I inclined and in a tone at once dignified and respectful an- 
nounced that my one desire was to comply with his. 

“But can you?” he cried. 

“T can indeed,” I assured him. 

“Ts it so? Adorable: child, wonderful child,” he stammered, “‘it 
is then within your power to grant my request? Great God, this 
shall be the discharge of my life.” 

When we had entered that little room my eyes had immedi- 
ately lit upon a package of some size, containing, so I guessed, 
things which would be very instrumental to the improvement of my 
pecuniary situation; that same instant I had conceived an over- 
powering wish to steal it—but how? I was nude. Where could I 
conceal the package? Although it was not long, it was bulky, about 
as thick as a man’s arm. 

“Your Honor,” I asked, “are you going to call in someone to 
help us?” 


Juliette & 165 


“No,” the financier answered, “my custom is to taste this final 
delight in solitude; so lubricious are my sensations, so voluptuous 
the gestures which they wring out of me... .” 

“Nonetheless,” I broke in peremptorily, “it cannot be done 
without some assistance.” 

“It can’t, my dear?” 

“Tt cannot, Monsieur.” 

“Eh then, if that is the case, pray go and see if one of the 
women is still about. If they’re all there, bring the youngest back 
with you: her ass got me quite palpably erect, and of them all ’tis 
she I fancy the most.” 

However, I had not budged. “Sir,” I pointed out, “I am not 
familiar with your house; and I am, furthermore, little disposed to 
move for, do you see, the state I am in... .” 

“The state? Ah, yes, the state. I'll ring then—”’ 

“I beg you under no circumstances to ring. You surely cannot 
expect me to appear before your servants thus?” 

“But my woman is out there, she’ll come.” 

‘‘Not at all. She is escorting the girls home.” 

“Damn my eyes!” he cried. “I cannot bear these delays.” 

And Mondor dashed from the room, vanishing into the apart- 
ment we'd just come from; and thus the idiot left me alone amidst 
his treasures. No need to think twice: in Noirceuil’s house J had had 
the very best reasons for restraining myself, here in Mondor’s I 
could give vent to this immense longing I had to commit a theft: I 
seize the opportunity, the instant my man’s back is turned I pounce 
upon the package, my hair is done up in a large chignon, that is 
where I cache my prize. No sooner had I stowed it away out of 
sight than Mondor called me. The girls had not left; would I please 
come into the apartment? For he preferred to have this final scene 
enacted in the same surroundings where the earlier ones had taken 
place. We were given instructions and work began: the youngest of 
the girls sucked the patient’s member, he filled her mouth with 
sperm while simultaneously into his I deposited the victual whereof 
he was so uncommonly fond. All went well, nothing was remarked, 
I readjusted myself, two carriages were waiting for us, and, hugely 
contented, Mondor bade us farewell after having distributed gen- 
erous largesse to us. 


166 && THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


When I had returned to the house of Noirceuil and shut 
myself up in privacy, I said to myself, even before I set to opening 
the package, ‘‘Great God, can Heaven itself have viewed my theft 
with favor?” 

Wrapped up in that parcel were sixty thousand francs in notes 
of credit payable to the bearer, already signed and requiring no 
further endorsement. 

It was then, as I was about to put these spoils away, I noticed 
that by some extraordinary coincidence while I'd been off stealing, 
somebody had been robb ng me: my secretary had been forced open, 
missing were five or six louis I'd kept in a drawer. Advised of the 
fact, Noirceuil assured rne that only one Gode could have been re- 
sponsible for it. This Gode was an extremely pretty girl of twenty 
whom Noirceuil had attached to my service since my entry into his 
household, whom he quie often had make a third in our pleasures, 
and whon, in the spirit of jollity such as the libertine intelligence 
conceives it, he had got one of his homosexual juveniles to impreg- 
nate. She was now in her sixth month. 

“Gode! Do you really believe it could have been she?” 

“T am certain of it, Juliette. Had you noticed her nervous 
manner ? How uneasily she withstood our interrogating glances?” 

Therewith, heedless of all save my perfidious selfishness, com- 
pletely forgetting my resolution never to work injury upon those 
who were my kinsmen ir villainy, with tears in my eyes I besought 
Noirceuil to have the culprit arrested. 

“I am perfectly willing to do as you suggest,” Noirceuil re- 
plied with a chilly lack of expression which I should have inter- 
preted accurately had mv preoccupied mind permitted me to remark 
it; “however, you're not to be deprived of any pleasure her punish- 
ment might afford you. She’s gravid, that will retard justice and 
while they fiddle-faddle the scoundrel may very well wriggle out of 
her plight. She’s young and attractive, you know.” 

“Ah, Christ!” I cried, “I am in despair.” 

“I dare say you must be, my beloved,” Noirceuil pursued 
quietly, ‘for you ambition to see her hanged; but it will be a good 
three months before they get her to the scaffold. Supposing now, 
Juliette, that you are ever able to enjoy the spectacle which, I fully 
appreciate, would have a very incisive effect upon a sensibility as 


Juliette & 167 


highly organized as yours, I must remind you that such pleasures 
are over and done with in fifteen or twenty minutes. I recommend 
that we somewhat prolong the wretch’s sufferings ; what say we 
make them extend over the rest of her life? It’s a simple matter. 
I'll have her confined to a dungeon in Bicétre; how old is she? 
Twenty? She could rot half a century in prison.” 

“Ah, my friend, a splendid plan!” 

“I only ask that you let me postpone putting it into operation 
until tomorrow; which would give me time to clothe this scheme 
with all the details and adjuncts needed to enhance its charm.” 

I embrace Noirceuil ; he has his carriage sent for and two hours 
later returns with the writ necessary to our enterprise. 

“She’s ours,” says the traitor; “‘we may now amuse ourselves. 
Let's play our parts convincingly.” Later, after we have dined and 
gone to his dressing room, he summons the poor girl. ‘“Gode, my 
dear Gode,” says he, “you know what my feelings for you are, the 
time is approaching when I shall want to demonstrate them: I am 
going to unite you to that young man who left in your womb the 
tokens of a noble affection for you; two thousand crowns a year, 
that shall guarantee the future of your ménage.” 

“Oh, Sire, you are too kind—-” 

“No, my child, I really am not, please, expressions of thanks 
embarrass me. You owe me none, of that you may be absolutely 
sure; this that you take for kindness is pure self-indulgence, the 
pleasure is all my own. From now on you have nothing to fear, 
everything has been settled owing to the steps I have lately taken; 
whereas you may not live in regal style, you shall never lack for a 
crust of bread.” 

Failing entirely to perceive the underlying significance of these 
words, Gode sprinkled tears of joy upon the hands of her fancied 
benefactor. 

“Eh then, Gode,”’ said my lover, “I ask for your cooperation 
this one last time; though I am not much taken by pregnant women, 
let me embugger you while kissing Juliette’s buttocks.” 

We assumed our stances; never had I seen Noirceuil so 
aroused. 

“A criminal thought excites most wondrously, does it not?” I 
whispered to him. 


168 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Incomparably,” he replied; “but whose would the crime be, 
and what would become of that thought, if she had truly robbed 
you?” 

“You are quite right, my dear.” 

“Take comfort, Juliette, take comfort, if crime there be, Gode 
is not its author. No, this wretch is as innocent of theft as are you; 
*twas I stole your money, you see.’ 

And as he spoke he had his prick hilt-driven into her ass, and 
he was kissing my mouth and paddling my buttocks. I confess that 
this triumph of wickedness fetched a discharge from me in a trice; 
grasping my lover’s hari, pressing it to my clitoris, by the fuck 
that beslimed his fingers I bade him judge of his infamy’s powerful 
effect upon my heart; he came the next moment, two or three furious 
jerks and a string of horrible blasphemies. heralded his delirium. 

.. But he had scarcely withdrawn his prick from Gode’s ass when, 
knocking softly at the door, a valet announced that the police con- 
stable was asking Noirceuil’s leave to carry out the mission he had 
been charged to execute. : 

‘Very good, have the officer wait a moment,” said Noirceuil, 
“Tl hand the culprit over to him, tell him so.” The valet dis- 
appeared; Noirceuil tu:ned complacently toward Gode. “Make 
haste there,” said he, ‘dress yourself. Your husband has come 
himself to fetch you away to the little country house which I have 
arranged for you to inhabit the remainder of your days.” 

Gode, trembling with anticipation, puts on her clothes, Noir- 
ceuil thrusts her out of :he room. Heavens! what must her ‘terror 
be as she catches sight of the black-clad man and his retinue, as 
they put manacles on her as though she were a criminal, as, above 
all else, she hears (and this, it would seem, made the deepest im- 
pression upon her) all tiie domestics, acquainted with the fact, cry 
out: 

‘Aye, ’tis she, sergeant, don’t let her get away, she’s a very 
bad one, beyond all doubt she broke into her Ladyship’s secretary 
and in doing so she brought suspicion to hang over all the rest of 
us—”’ 

“I, break into Mzdemoiselle’s secretary!’ Gode protested, 
her knees about to buckle. “I! God be my witness, but I am in- 
capable of any such thing.” 


Juliette & 169 


The constable paused, looked inquiringly at Noirceuil. 

“Eh,” said the latter, “do- you shirk your duty, Sir? Justice 
will be done, you understand, you are employed for that.” 

The wretch was dragged off and flung into one of the most 
cheerless of the unhealthy Bicétre dungeons, where upon her arrival 
she had a miscarriage which came within an ace of putting an end 
to her life. But she did not succumb. No, there is breath in her yet; 
which, by the simplest computation, means that for many a long 
year she has been lamenting her errors, and they can be said to 
consist in having stirred up powerful desires in Noirceuil, who goes 
at least once every six months to savor her tears and to issue recom- 
mendations to her wardens that, if possible, they tighten the irons 
that bind her. 

“Tell me now,” said Noirceuil, as soon as Gode had been led 
away, and as he returned to me double the sum removed from my 
secretary, “isn’t that a hundred times better than if she had been 
confided to an uncertain and perhaps merciful justice? We'd not 
have been able to exert any control over her destiny, whereas,” he 
smiled, “this way it is in our hands forever.” 

“Oh, Noirceuil, thou art an evil man... and what joys thou 
hast fashioned for thyself!” 

“Yes,” my lover acknowledged, “I knew the constable was 
waiting at the threshold, and believe me, I discharged deliciously 
into the ass of the prey I was about to surrender to him.” 

“‘A very evil man you are, a very wicked man... but why is it 
that I too could not help but taste the wildest pleasures in the 
infamy you committed ?” 

“Precisely because it is one,” Noirceuil answered; “there is no 
imaginable infamy that does not give pleasure. Crime is the soul of 
lubricity; there is no real lubricity without crime: there are, thus, 
passions which are the massacre of humaneness and . . . of hu- 
manity.” 

“If that be so, they must obviously have no connection with 
Nature, those tiresome humane sentiments upon which moralists 
constantly expatiate. Or could it be that there are moments when 
an inconsistent Nature countermands with one voice what she 
enjoins with another ?” 

“Ah, Juliette, become better acquainted with her, this pro- 


170 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


foundly wise, this sweetly bountiful Nature, never would she have 
us aid others save our motive for doing so be profit or fear: 

“Fear, because we dread lest the woes our weakness leads us 
to relieve in others befall us in our turn. 

“And profit—we succor others in the hope that we will gain 
thereby, or in order to flatter our lustful pride. 

“But as soon as a more imperious passion than charity makes 
itself heard, all the other passions fall mute, egoism then reclaims 
its sacred rights, our lips curl scornfully at the torments others have 
to endure; what sympathies can these torments awake in us? They 
are never‘any of our concern except in as much as we may ourselves 
have to undergo them well, if pity is bred of fear, it is then a 
weakness whence with all possible dispatch we ought to protect, to 
purge ourselves.” 

“This calls for a fuller development,” I remarked to Noir- 
ceuil. ““You have demonstrated the inexistence of virtue, will you 
kindly explain to me what crime is; for if on the one hand you 
annihilate what I am advised to respect and on the other you be- 
little what I] ought to fear, you shall surely put my soul in the 
state I desire it to be in so as henceforth to dread the undertaking of 
nothing.” 

“Will you then sit down, Juliette, and make yourself comfort- 
able,”’ Noirceuil suggested, “for this requires a serious dissertation, 
and if what I shall have to say is to be intelligible to you, you must 
lend me your whole attention. 

“Crime: the term is applied to any formal violation, whether 
fortuitous or premeditated, of what in the human community goes 
under the name of law; whence we have but one more arbitrary and 
meaningless word: for laws are relative, depending upon customs, 
upon considerations varying according to time and place; they are 
utterly different every rew hundred miles, and so it is that were I 
to take ship or board the mail-coach I could, for having performed 
one and the same deed, find myself condemned to death on Sunday 
morning in Paris and a public hero on Saturday of the same week 
in some land on the frontiers of Asia or on the coasts of Africa. 
Faced with this towering absurdity, philosophy has returned to the 
following fundamental propositions. I enumerate: 

“1) That in themselves all acts are indifferent; that they are 


Juliette & 171 


neither good nor bad intrinsically, and if man now and then so 
qualifies them, the sole criteria by which he performs his judgment 
are the laws he has elaborated for himself or the form of govern- 
ment under which he chances to live; but from the standpoint of 
Nature, and barring all else from consideration, all our acts are as 
one, none better, none worse than the rest. 

2) That if from somewhere within us there arises a murmur 
of protestation against the acts of wickedness we concert, this voice 
is nothing whatever but the effect of our prejudices and education, 
and that if we had been born and reared in some other climate, it 
would address us in a very different language. 

‘‘3) That if in changing country we were still to be subject to 
these inspirations, that would in no wise demonstrate their goodness 
but merely that one’s earliest impression’ are only with some effort 
effaced. 

4) That, lastly, remorse, or the sentiment of guilt, is the 
same thing, that is to say, purely and simply the effect of the 
earliest impressions one receives, which habit alone can neutralize 
and which one ought to labor determinedly to destroy. 

‘‘And indeed, to find out whether something be truly criminous 
or not, one must first find out what harm it can do to Nature; for 
one can rationally describe as a crime only that which might conflict 
with her laws. Nature being constant, this crime must hence be 
uniform: the deed must prove to be of some sort or other that all 
the races and nations of the earth hold it in equal and tremendous 
horror, and the loathing it inspires must be as universal in man as 
his desire to satisfy his elementary needs; well, of this species of 
deed there is not one that exists; that which unto us has the most 
atrocious and execrable aspect has been a cornerstone to ethics else- 
where. 

‘Crime, thus, is not in any sense real, there is thus, veritably, 
no crime, no thinkable way or means for outraging a Nature in 
ceaseless flux and action . . . eternally so superior to us as, from 
where aloft she superintends the general order, to be infinitely above 
worrying about us or what we do. There is no act, however awful, 
however atrocious, however infamous you like or can imagine it, 
which we cannot perform every time we sense the urge, why! which 
we have the right not to commit, since Nature puts the idea in our 


172 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


heads; for our usages, our religions, our manners and customs may 
easily and indeed must perforce deceive us, whilst we shall cer- 
tainly never be misled by the voice of Nature: it is upon a mixture 
combining strictly equal parts of what we term crime and virtue 
that her operations and laws are based: destruction is the soil and 
light that renews her and where she thrives; it is upon crime she 
subsists; it is, in a word, through death she lives. A totally virtuous 
universe could not endure for a minute; the learned hand of Nature 
brings order to birth out of chaos, and wanting chaos, Nature must 
fail to attain anything: such is the profound equilibrium which 
holdeth the stars aright in their courses, which suspendeth them in 
these huge oceans of void, which maketh them to move periodically 
and by rule. She must have evil, ’tis from this stuff she creates good; 

upon crime her existence is seated, and all would be undone were 
the world to be inhabited by doers of good ‘alone. Now, Juliette, I 
inquire of you: once evil is indispensable to Nature’s major designs, 
once she is helpless to function, once she is impotent without it, how 
can the individual who does evil help but be useful to Nature? and 
what doubt remains but that the wicked man is he whom Nature has 
deliberately so framed ir order to achieve her ends? Why do we 
decline to acknowledge that she has done with men what she has 
done with beasts? are nct all classes, like all species, in perpetual 
strife, do they not mutually batten one upon the other, does 
not one or the other weaken, wilt, perish away, depending upon the 
state or shape which Nature’s laws must give to the natural order? 
Who can deny that Nero’s gesture, when he poisoned Agrippina, 
was one of the effects of those selfsame laws, as rigidly everlasting 
as that other law whereby the wolf devours the lamb? who doubts 
that the prescriptions of a Marius or a Sulla are anything other 
than the plague or the famine Nature sometimes unleashes over the 
length and breadth of a continent? She does not, I know, assign to 
mankind as a whole the perpetration of a given crime, but each 
man is allotted a certain talent and a certain propensity for a certain 
crime, thus does she ensu-e a certain harmony: from the sum of all 
these misdeeds, from the entirety of all these lawful or unlawful 
destructions, she extracts the chaos, the decline, the decrepitude she 
must have to recast order, to renew growth, to restore vigor. Why 
did she give us poisons if she was not anxious to have men employ 


Juliette 173 


them? why ever did she cause Tiberius to be born, or Heliogabalus, 
or Andronicus, or Herod, or Wenceslas, or all the other great 
villains or heroes (they are synonymous) who have been the 
scourges of the earth—why, if the devastations wrought by these 
bloody men did not answer her requirements and promote her ends? 
Why does she send, concurrently with these scoundrels and to act 
in concert with them, plagues, wars, blights, and dearths, if it were 
not essential that Nature destroy, and if crime and destruction were 
not inseparable from her laws? If then it be essential that she 
destroy, why does he who feels himself born to destroy resist his 
penchants, neglect his duties? Might one not say that if there were 
an evil thing in this world, if there could be, it would be visibly that 
which one commits in resisting the destiny Nature has prepared for 
each of us? In order that crime, which neither does nor can offend 
anyone or anything but our fellows, irritate Nature, one would 
have to pretend that she takes a greater interest in some persons 
than in others, and that, though we be all equally formed by her 
hand, we are not however all equally her children. But if we are all 
alike, save for our greater or lesser strength; if Nature goes to no 
more trouble shaping an emperor than a chimney sweep, the different 
activities of high conquest and menial service are simply the neces- 
sary accidents that derive directly from the initial impulsion, and 
both conquering and the cleaning of flues have got to be done, for 
we have been expressly formed and intended to do them. When 
next we see that Nature has physically distinguished individual 
persons, that she has made some strong, others weak, what could 
be more patently evident than that, in so making them, she expects 
the strong to commit the crimes she needs to have committed, just 
as it is of the essence of the wolf that he devour the lamb, just as 
the essence of the mouse is to be devoured by the cat? 

‘And so it was very correctly that the Celts, our earliest an- 
cestors, held that the highest and most sacred of our rights was that 
of might, which is to say, that of Nature; and they considered that 
when Nature deems wise to assign a superior quality of potential 
to some one of us, she does so only to confirm the prepotency over 
the weak which she invests in us strong. Thus, it was by no means 
mistakenly that these same people, whence we descend, claimed not 
only that this right was sacred, but that Nature’s express intent, in 


174 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


granting it to us, was that we exploit it; that, in order to conform 
to her wishes, the greater had perforce to despoil the lesser; and 
that these latter ought best bow before what was irresistible and 
relinquish what they were in no position to defend. If since Celtic 
days matters have changed physically, they haven’t morally. The 
opulent man represents what is mightiest in society; he has bought 
up all the rights; he ouzht therefore to enjoy them; with their 
enjoyment in view, he ought to the fullest possible extent pave the 
way for the satisfaction 2f his caprices by exacting discipline, for- 
bearance, and compliance from the other, the subordinate, class of 
men; and this he may, he must, do without in any sense wronging 
Nature, since he but uses the right he has been either materially or 
conventionally awarded. Let me repeat: had Nature intended to 
bar us from crime, she would have been very able to withhold from 
us the means for committing it. She furnished us those means at the 
outset, and she gives thei to us still: for she is nothing loath that 
we possess them; she looks upon our crimes as either of no account 
or as necessary: as of no account if they be petty; as always and 
eminently desirable if they be capital; for ’tis all the same thing, 
whether I filch my neighbor’s purse, rape his son, his wife, or his 
daughter : these are mere pranks, of too slight importance and scope 
ever to be of any major utility to Nature; but it is very necessary 
to her that I kill that son, that wife, or that daughter when, giving 
me the idea, Nature sugzests the crime. And that is why the pen- 
chants—the desires we sense—to undertake great crimes are always 
more intense than those we sense for the small ones, and why the 
pleasure we reap from enormities is always a thousand times keener. 
Would she have composed a gradated schedule of the pleasure 
afforded by all crimes if t were not to her interest that we commit 
them? does she not indicate by the regularly mounting charm she 
has attached to progressively awful crimes that her intention is to 
encourage us ever farther up the slope? These unspeakable quiver- 
ings of delectation we ar2 subject to when we prepare a crime; this 
wild intoxication which possesses us when we perform it; this secret 
joy which lingers in us long after it has been perpetrated: does all 
this not prove that she has so cunningly baited the deed because she 
yearns to have us commit it? and that, since our reward increases 
in proportion to the majnitude of its wickedness, ’tis because the 


Juliette & 175 


crime of destruction, conventionally regarded as the most atrocious 
of all, is howbeit the very one which most contents her ??® For 
whether the crime results from vengeance, or from ambition, or 
from lubricity, we shall, if we scrutinize ourselves clear-sightedly, 
see that this attractiveness I speak of is always greater or lesser 
depending upon the greater or lesser violence or blackness of the 
deed; and when the destruction of our fellow beings is the effect of 
the cause, murder’s charm becomes limitless, because this is the 
necessary and very grave form of mischief which most benefits 
Nature.” 

“Oh, Noirceuil!” I cried, unable to contain myself, ‘‘it is cer- 
tainly true that what we have just done has given me vast pleasure, 
but I’d have had ten times more had I seen her hang—” 

“Come now, admit the whole truth: had you hanged her your- 
self.” 

“Christ, yes, yes! I admit it! The mere thought is making me 
discharge.” 

“And the pleasure you have felt was doubled, wasn’t it, 
Juliette, by your knowledge of her innocence? Had she been guilty, 
our deed would have been in the service of the law: and we would 
have been cheated of all that is delicious in evil. 

“Ah!” Noirceuil continued, ‘‘it cannot be overstressed: would 
Nature have given us passions if she had not known that these 
passions’ results would enact her will, enforce her laws, further her 
aims? So well did man recognize this that he too felt moved to 
compose laws whose object would be to check this invincible urge 
which, driving him to crime, would bring about the ruination of 
everything; but man behaved unjustly, for his laws are repressive, 
taking away infinitely more than they bestow; in return for the 
scanty security they afford him, they deprive him, perhaps, of all 
that is worth having. 

“But these laws, originating with mere mortals, merit no 


16 Beloved La Mettrie, learned Helvétius, sage and perspicacious Montesquieu! 
having so profoundly apprehended this truth, why did you not set it forth in so many 
words in your immortal writings? O century of ignorance and tyranny, what a grave 
disservice you have done the human understanding, and in what slavery you have 
maintained the world’s greatest minds! Let us then speak forthrightly today, since we 
are at liberty to do so; and since we owe mankind the truth, let us have the courage 
to reveal it entire. 


176 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


consideration from the philosopher; never shall they be allowed to 
halt or influence the gestures Nature dictates to him; the one effect 
they can have upon a man of intelligence is to encourage him to 
cover up his movements and maintain vigilance: laws? let’s use 
them for our own purposes, as a shield, never as a brake.” 

“But, my friend,” I remarked to Noirceuil, “if that were 
everybody’s attitude, there’d be no shield.” 

“Very well,” my lover replied, ‘‘in that case we shall revert to 
the state of uncivilization in which Nature created us: that, surely, 
would be no great misfortune. It will then be up to the weak man to 
devise a policy for avoiding collisions with the strong and for avert- 
ing open warfare; he will at least have a clear view of what’s to be 
dreaded, and shan’t be any the more unhappy for that, since as 
things now stand he has the same struggle to wage but, in his self- 
defense, he is unable to ernploy the meager store of weapons Nature 
has armed him with. Institute this little regression, and every State 
would be far better off, it’s been proven, and there would be no 
further necessity for laws. But we stray afield.” 

“One of our forernost prejudices attaching to the subject 
under discussion is bred 9f the sort of tie we gratuitously suppose 
to exist between other men and ourselves: an illusory tie—an 
absurd tie whence we have confectioned this curious sort of brother- 
hood sacralized by religion. I should now make a few elucidating 
observations about this >rotherhood affair, for the course of my 
entire experience has shown me that the fabulous notion of frater- 
nity hinders and hobbles the passions a great deal more than one 
would suppose; owing tc the weight it exerts upon human reason, 
I'd best lose no time discrediting it in your eyes. 

“All living creatures are born isolated; from birth, they have 
no need one of the other: abstain from tampering with men, leave 
them in their pristine natural state, refrain from civilizing them, 
and each will find his own way, his food, his shelter, without his 
fellow beings’ help. The strong will see to their livelihoods wholly 

17 Highly entertaining, don’t you agree, this profusion of laws that man enacts 
every day in order to promote Lis happiness, although there’s not a one amongst them 
all which, to the contrary, does not deprive him of some part of the happiness he 
already has. The purpose of all these laws? But do you ask? Rogues must not be 


denied their profits, and fools have got to be .subjugated—there, in a nutshell, you 
have the whole secret of our human civilization. 


Juliette & 177 


unaided; the weak alone may need some assistance; but Nature 
has given us these weak individuals to be our slaves: they are her 
gift to us, a sacrifice: their condition is proof thereof; the strong 
man may hence use the weak as he sees fit; may he not aid them 
in some instances? No; for if he does, he acts contrary to Nature’s 
will. If he enjoys this inferior object, if he harnesses him into the 
service of his whims, if he tyrannizes him, oppresses, vexes, sports 
with him, wears him out, or finally destroys him, then he behaves 
as Nature’s friend; but, I say unto you once again, if, in reverse, 
he aids the abject, raises the lowly to a level of parity with himself 
by sharing some of his power or some of his substance or placing 
some of his authority at the disposal of the mean, then he neces- 
sarily disrupts the natural order and perverts the natural law: 
whence it results that pity, far from being a virtue, becomes a real 
vice once it leads us to meddle with an inequality prescribed by 
Nature’s laws and lacking which she cannot function properly; 
and that the ancient philosophers, who behold it as a flaw in the 
soul, as one of those illnesses one had speedily to cure oneself of, 
were not in error, since pity’s effects are diametrically opposed 
to those produced by Nature’s laws, whereof the fundamental 
bases are differences, discriminations, inequalities.1* This fanciful 
bond of brotherhood could have been dreamt up only by some 
feeble individual; for it to have occurred to one of the mighty, 
in need of nothing, would not have been natural: to bind the weak 
to his will, he already had what the task required: his strength; 
what to him would have been the utility of this bond? ’twas 
invented by some puny wretch, and it is founded upon arguments 
quite as futile as would be this one addressed by the lamb to the 
wolf: You mustn’t eat me, I am four-footed too. 

“The weak, proclaiming the existence of the bond of brother- 
hood, were bidden by such obvious motives as to eliminate 
in advance any possibility that the pact established by this 
bond be taken seriously. Moreover, no pact ever acquires 
any force save through the sanction of the two contracting 
parties; and this pact has been proposed and decreed unilaterally ; 


18 Aristotle, in his Poetics, would have it that the aim of a poet’s efforts is to cure 
us of fear and pity, which the philosopher considers the source of all the ills which 
afflict man; and, one might add, they are also the source of all his vices. 


178 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


what could be plainer than that the strong would never have 
consented and never will consent to it: what in the devil’s 
name was that remote pygmy thinking of when he imagined 
this bond! What good did he suppose it would do him? When one 
gives something, it’s to receive something in return: that’s the 
law of Nature; and, here, in giving assistance to the weak, in 
stripping off some quantity of one’s strength so as to clad one’s 
inferior in it, what does the strong get from the bargain? How 
can one ascribe any reality to a contract when, essentially, -one 
of the parties must, in the light of his own highest interests, de- 
nounce it for a hoax or a joke beforehand? For, by taking it 
seriously and accepting it, the strong cedes a lot and gains nothing; 
which is why he never once subscribed to this nonsense; it being 
nonsense, some sort of misbegotten notion, it deserves no respect 
from us. We may unhesitatingly repudiate an arrangement pro- 
posed by our inferiors, by which we would only be in a way to lose. 

“The religion of that wily little sneak Jesus—feeble, sickly, 
persecuted, singularly desirous to outmaneuver the tyrants of the 
day, to bully them into acknowledging a brotherhood doctrine 
from whose acceptance he calculated to gain some respite—Chris- 
tianity sanctioned these laughable fraternal ties; what else could 
have been expected? Here we see Christianity in the role of the 
weaker party; Christianity represents the weak and must speak 
and sound like them; nothing surprising in this, either. But that he 
who is neither weak nor Christian subject himself to such restric- 
tions, voluntarily entangle himself in this mythical snarl of brotherly 
relationships which without benefiting him in the least deprive 
him enormously—it’s unthinkable; and from these arguments we 
must conclude that not only has the bond of fraternity never 
authentically existed amorgst men, but that it never could have, 
for it is even contrary to Nature, who could never for an instant 
have intended to have men equalize that which she had differ- 
entiated so energetically. We may, we should, be persuaded that 
this bond was, in truth, proposed by the weak, was sanctioned by 
them when, as it so happened, sacerdotal authority passed into 
their hands; but we must also be persuaded that its existence is 
frivolous and that we must not under any circumstances submit 
to it.” 


Juliette 179 


“Therefore, it is false that men are brothers?” I interrupted 
excitedly. ““There is then no kind of real bond between another 
human being and myself? Is it then so, that the only manner in 
which I need act with this other individual is to wrest from him 
all I possibly can and cede him as little?” 

“Precisely,” Noirceuil replied. ““For whatever you give to 
him is lost to you, and you gain proportionately as you take. 

“T may add, indeed, that, searching into my soul for the laws 
of comportment which are signed there in the indelible script of 
Nature, I find this the most primary, the most fundamental in- 
junction: do not love, certainly do not give aid to, these so-called 
brothers; instead, make them serve your passions. And that is the 
text I heed. According to it, if the money, if the enjoyment, if 
the lives of these purported brothers are instrumental to my well- 
being or useful to my existence, then, my dear, as quick as ever 
I can, I grab what I want by main force if I am the stronger, and 
if I am the weaker, by stealth; if for these things I want I am 
obliged to pay something, then I try to get them for the lowest 
possible price if I have no way of stealing them; for I tell you 
once again, this neighbor is nought to me, between him and myself 
there is no positive relationship whatever, and if I establish one, 
it’s with the object of having from him, by cunning, what I cannot 
wring from him by violence; but if I can succeed through violence,

“Oh, Juliette! study then to seal your heart against the 
fallacious accents of woe and indigence. If the bread that this 
wretch eats is wet by his tears, if a day’s drudgery scarcely enables 
him to carry home at eventide enough to keep his exhausted family’s 
body and soul together, if the taxes he must pay soak up the better 
part of his meager savings, if his naked, untaught children are 
driven into the depths of the forest in search of a vile aliment 
whose having they must dispute with wild beasts, if his own 
helpmeet’s breast, withered from toil, dried by want, cannot fur- 
nish her suckling that initial subsistence capable of giving him size 
enough and strength to go tear the rest from the jaws of wolves, 
if, bent under the weight of the years, of ills, of griefs, he sees 
nothing but the doom-sped end of his career lunge his way in

great sure strides, and if in all his life he has never beheld a single 
star for one instant rise pure and serene above his downcast head; 
why, tush, it is a simple matter, common enough, altogether 
natural, nothing in it that doesn’t sit appropriately within the 
order and the law of that great universal mother who governs us 
all, and if you have decided that this man is unhappy, ’tis because 
you have compared his lot with yours; but, at bottom, he isn’t, 
you're mistaken. Were he to tell you that he so considers himself, 
then he too is wrong. He likewise has made an instant’s comparison 
between his case and yours: let him crawl away, and once he’s in 
the company of his peers, there’s an end to his whimperings. Under 
the feudal regime, treated like an animal, domesticated and beaten 
like one, sold like the dirt he trudged upon and delved, was not 
his plight a good deal sorrier? Instead of taking pity on his suffer- 
ings, of mitigating them and turning them ridiculously into a burden 
to be borne by your owr: sympathies, be sensible, my dear, and view 
him merely as a creature Nature has designed for your enter- 
tainment, as one she offers for whatever use you deign to put 
him to; rather than wipe his tears, redouble the cause of his weep- 
ings, if you like, if it amuses you: lo! here are human beings 
Nature’s readied for the scythe of your passions; reap a goodly 
harvest, dear Juliette, Nature is bountiful; emulate the spider, 
spin your webs, and mercilessly devour everything that Nature’s 
wise and liberal hand casts into the meshes.” 

‘My beloved!” I cried, hugging Noirceuil to me, “how enor- 
mous is my debt to you for dissipating the miasmas of ignorance 
childhood instruction and prejudice brewed in my spirit! Your 
sublime lessons are unt my heart what the healing dew is to sun- 
scorched vegetation. O, light of my life, I see no more, I com- 
prehend no more save through your eyes, with your mind; but, 
annihilating the fear I had of its danger, you kindle in me an 
ardent desire to hurl myself into crime. Will you be my guide in 
this delicious journey? Will you hold aloft the lamp of philosophy 
to light the way? Or perhaps you'll abandon me—after having 
led me far astray; and then, putting myself in jeopardy by having 
put in action principles as stern as these you’ve taught me to cherish, 
ringed round by the exceeding peril of these maxims, and alone, 


Juliette & 181 


in this fair land of roses I’ll be exposed only to thorns, unshielded 
by your influence, undirected by your advice. I wonder. . . .” 

“Juliette,” said Noirceuil, “these reflections demonstrate your 
weakness—and betray your sensibility. My child, one must be 
strong and hard when one decides to be wicked. 

“You will never be the victim of my passions; but neither shall 
I ever assure your status nor serve as your protector; one has got 
to learn to manage by oneself, to rely upon one’s own solitary 
resources if one is to travel the road of your choosing; one must, 
all alone, discover the means for eluding the pitfalls thick-strewn 
the whole length of the way, one must develop keen perceptions 
to spy them out in advance, one must know what to do in case of 
miscarriage and indeed how to face the ultimate catastrophe if it 
cannot be averted; no matter what, Juliette, you will never be 
threatened by anything worse than the scaffold and, in truth, it’s 
not so very dreadful. Once one has realized that we must all die 
someday, does it make any real difference whether it be on a 
platform or in a bed? Shall I make you a little confession, Juliette ? 
Then I'll tell you that execution, a minute’s affair, terrifies me 
infinitely less than dying what they are pleased to call a peaceful 
death accompanied by what may very well be hideous circum- 
stances. To hang is shameful? Not in my view; and even if it were, 
in order of their importance, I’d rate shame last on the list of 
factors involved. And so, my dear, put your mind at rest and to 
fly depend only upon your own wings. It’s safer, always.” 

“Ah, Noirceuil, you'll not, even for my sake, set your prin- 
ciples aside.” 

“Tn all of Nature there is not a single creature-in whose favor 
I can turn my back upon them. 

“However, let’s proceed with the demonstration of crime’s 
inexistence. I should like now to cite some examples in support of 
my thesis, that’s the likeliest way to convince you. We'll cast a 
quick glance at how matters stand in this world and we'll see 
whether what is termed criminal in one area doesn’t crop up as 
virtuous somewhere else. 

“We dare not wed our wife’s sister; Hudson Bay savages

“We dare not fuck our own children even though there are 
few more delicious pleasures; in Persia, intrigues are exclusively 
of that variety, and ’tis the same in three-quarters of Asia. Lot 
lay with his two daughters and got them both with child. 

‘“‘We consider the prostitution of our wives a very great in- 
delicacy: in Tartary, in Lapland, in America it’s a courtesy, it’s 
an honor to prostitute vour wife to a stranger; the Illyrians take 
them to assemblies of debauchery and, the while supervising the 
proceedings, force ther. to fuck whoever takes a fancy to them. 

“‘We think it an outrage to modesty when we expose ourselves 
naked to the sight of others: almost all southern peoples go about 
thus unclad without any subtle intentions; the Priapic and Bacchic 
festivals of antiquity were so celebrated. Lycurgus, by a law, 
obliged girls to appear nude when they attended public theaters. 
The Tuscans, the Romans had nude women serve them at table. 
There is a country in India where respectable women are never 
seen in clothes; these are only worn by courtesans, the better to 
excite concupiscence. Think of that; quite the opposite, isn’t it, 
of our conventional notions concerning modesty? 

“Our generals fortid the rape of the defenders of a captured 
fortress; Greek commanders gave their soldiers the right as a 
reward for valor. After the capture of Carbines, the army of 
Tarentum collected all the boys, the virgins, and the young women 
who could be unearthed in the town, stripped and exposed them in 
the market place, where everybody chose what he wanted, either 
to fuck or to kill it. 

“The Indians of Mount Caucasus live like brute beasts, they 
couple indiscriminately. ‘The women of the Isle of Hornes prostitute 
themselves to men in broad daylight, doing so even on the steps 
of their god’s temple. 

“The Scythians ard Tartars revered a man who through 
debauchery wasted himself into impotence while yet in his prime. 

“Horace portrays the Britons, the English of today, as being 
most libertine with foreigners; this folk, says the poet, had no 
native modesty; they lived all aheap in a promiscuous community, 
brothers, fathers, mothers, children, anyone suited to the satis- 
faction of Nature’s needs, and the resulting fruit belonged to

whoever had been the first to lie with the mother when she had 
been a virgin. These people ate human flesh.” 

“The Tahitians satisfy their desires publicly, would blush at 
the thought of enacting them in hiding. Before ‘them, Europeans 
displayed their religious ceremonies, consisting in the celebration 
of that ridiculous mummery they call Mass. They in their turn 
asked to be allowed to display theirs: it was the rape of a little 
girl of ten by a grown boy of twenty-five. What a difference! 

“Debauchery itself is worshiped: temples are raised to 
Priapus; Aphrodite is at the start beheld as the goddess of fertility 
and increase, later as the principle of the most depraved lusts, 
adoration concentrates upon her ass, and she who initially was 
regarded as the idol of generation soon becomes the tutelary 
divinity of the grossest outrages man can perpetrate against popu- 
lation. Man, you see, grew ever in knowledge and intelligence: 
he had inevitably to progress: he ended up vicious. This cult, sink- 
ing into desuetude along with paganism’s eclipse, revives in India; 
and the lingam, a sort of virile member Asiatic girls wear sus- 
pended from their neck, is nothing but an article of furniture whose 
use is required in the temples of Priapus. 

‘‘A traveler arriving in Pegu rents a girl for the duration of 
his stay in the country; with her he does whatever he pleases; after- 
ward, much enriched by her experience, she returns to her family 
and if anything finds a surfeit of suitors eager to marry her. 

“‘Indecency itself can become modish: witness France, where 
for a long time male genitals were represented in brocade-work 
applied to the vest and where brightly colored codpieces were very 
fashionable. 

‘Among nearly all the peoples of the north one meets with 
the traditional prostitution of sisters and daughters, a custom which 
strikes me as altogether reasonable; he who practices it calculates 
to receive something in return from the man he panders to, or 
at least to watch him in action, and this lubricity is delicious enough

experience will make short shrift of it; once one has sampled such meats, one’s palate

to be worth going to considerable trouble to obtain. There is 
another, an exceedingly delicate, sentiment connected with prosti- 
tution of this type, and it is enough to induce certain men to make 
their wives’ favors generally available, as do I; that which usually 
motivates our gesture is this: we derive unheard-of stimulation 
from covering ourselves with an especially poignant obloquy; the 
more one multiplies the effects of one’s shame, the greater the 
pleasure one extracts from it. Thus it is we like to degrade, be- 
smirch, mistreat the object that we amuse ourselves giving over to 
be fucked; we delight in dragging it through mud, making it wallow 
in filth, in fine, in doing rather as I do: carrying one’s wife and 
daughter to the brothel, forcing them to solicit in the streets, 
holding them oneself during the act of prostitution.” 

“Excuse me, Monsieur,” I broke in, “but did I understand 
you to say that you have a daughter ?” 

“T had one,” Noirceuil replied. 

“By the wife whor I know?” 

“No, by my first wife; the one I have in the house at present 
is my eighth, Juliette.” 

“But with tastes like yours, how ever could you have become 
a father?” 

“I have been one several times, my dear. There are no grounds 
here for surprise. The thing can be done, one sometimes over- 
comes one’s repugnances when pleasures may be the reward of an 
honest effort.” 

“I believe I understand you, Monsieur.” 

‘Like almost everything else, this is ridiculously simple. And 
yet I'll have first to acquire a high opinion of you before, in giving 
you an explanation, I disclose how little I merit one myself.” 

I gazed at him admiringly. ‘Unusual man, charming indi- 
vidual,” I exclaimed, ‘‘my devotion to you shall only grow as you 
give me accumulating proof of your disdain for vulgar prejudices; 
the more criminal you exhibit yourself to these my avid eyes, the 
deeper my heart’s vene:ation for you shall be. The irregularity of 
your imagination sets mine in a ferment; I aspire only to imitate 

“Ah, by God,” murmured Noirceuil, running his tongue into 
my mouth, “I have never beheld a creature more analogous to me;

I'd adore her if ‘twere in my power to love a woman. . . . Would 
you imitate me, Juliette ? I defy thee to do so. If what were enclosed 
in my heart could be opened to the light, it would so horrify the 
race of men there’d perhaps not be one amongst them all who'd 
dare come within sight of me. Impudence and crime, libertinage 
and foul infamy, I’ve carried them to the last degree; and if I know 
the taste of regret, 'tis, I do swear with utmost sincerity, owing 
to nothing but despair at having done so little, so very much less 
than I ought.” 

Noirceuil was in a state of prodigious agitation, sufficient to 
convince me that the avowal of his errors excited him almost as 
much as their very performance. I drew aside the ample robe he 
was wearing and, seizing his more than iron-hard member, I set 
to juggling it, to dandling and palpating it gently: from the scarlet 
orifice fuck dribbled in a steady stream. 

“What a tale of crimes that prick has cost me!” he cried, 
“what a host of execrable things have I done in order that it 
might surrender its sperm a slight shade more hotly. Upon this 
globe’s whole extent there is not a single object I’m not ready 
to sacrifice to its comfort: this tool is my god, let it be one unto 
thee, Juliette: extol it, worship it, this despotic engine, show it 
every reverence, it is a thing proud of its glory, insatiate, a tyrant; 
I'd fain make the earth bend its knee in universal homage to this 
prick, I'd like to see it guised in the shape of a terrific personage 
who would put to a death of awful torments every last living soul 
that thought to deny it the least of a thousand services. . . . Were 
I king, Juliette, were I sovereign lord of this world, supreme here, 
my supremest sovereign pleasure would be to walk about with 
killing henchmen in my train, to massacre instantly whatever dis- 
pleased my very sensitive glance. . . . I’d tread the full length and 
breadth of my domain everywhere upon a carpet of corpses, and 
I'd be happy; I’d wade across an infinite scene of destruction, and 
to the sea of blood wherein my feet would steep I’d add my flowing 
seed.” 

Drunk also, I sink down before this wondrous libertine; in- 
continently, I do enthusiastic worship to the spring of so many 
fell deeds whereof the mere recollection incomparably aroused him

who had committed them; I take that article in my mouth, for 
fifteen delicious minutes [ suck upon it... . 

“Stay, stay, we are too few,” says Noirceuil, who was little 
fond of solitary pleasures. ‘‘Leave me be; that prick could be your 
undoing were you to pretend to the honor of fetching a discharge 
from it all by yourselz: concentrated upon a single point, my 
passions are like the sun’s rays a magnifying lens collects into focus: 
they straightway cinder the object in their path.” 

And, foam flecking his lips, Noirceuil’s strong hands began to 
worry my buttocks. 

That was the moment when one of Gode’s captors returned 
with news of her entry into the prison of Bicétre and of the still- 
born infant she foaled shortly afterward. 

“Excellent,” said Noirceuil, sending the man on his way with 
a tip of two Jouis; ‘‘one cannot,” he confided to me in a whisper, 
a smile on his lips, ‘overpay the messenger bringing tidings of such 
welcome events. Two /ouis—that matches the little prank we've 
just treated ourselves to . . . and notice, Juliette, look here! see 
how my prick takes on an air of increased majesty.” 

And immediately summoning into an antechamber his wife 
and the youthful fop who'd sired the child just destroyed, Noirceuil 
advised him of what had come to pass, embuggering the youth as 
he spoke, while Madame de Noirceuil, kneeling, mouthed the 
Ganymede’s member, and while, under instructions, the pederast 
kissed my buttocks; and in the midst of this, Noirceuil caught firm 
hold of his wife’s breasts from below and gave them so fair a 
wrenching as to nearly tear them loose from her body; the lady’s 
screams soon brought the fuck spitting in a torrent from his prick. 

“Tell me, Juliette,” he continued, ordering the young man 
to evacuate into his cusped palm the fuck he’d squirted into his 
bowels, and rudely smearing that rich paste all over the face of 
his wife, “tell me, is no: my sperm pure? Have you ever seen such 
fine sperm? Am I wrong in having you worship the god whose 
substance is so magnificent? Never did he whom fools designate 
prime mover to the world possess a more active or refined, a 
nobler; this be very goclsfuck—but have them get out of here,” he 
cried, “away with them all. I regret having had to interrupt our 
conversation.

“We today punish libertinage,"” my master resumed when we 
were alone again; “and from Plutarch we learn that the Samnites 
daily and in conformance with legal prescriptions betook themselves 
to a place known as the Gardens, and that in a promiscuous con- 
fusion they there comported themselves in a manner almost too 
lascivious to be imagined. In that blissful locality, the historian 
goes on to say, the heat of pleasure melted distinctions of sex and 
blood ties altogether away : one became husband to the wife of one’s 
friend; the daughter communicated intimately with her mother; 
and yet more often one saw the son play the whore to his sire 
alongside the brother busily embuggering his sister. 

“The first fruits of a young girl are highly prized by us. The

“Adultery was publicly authorized in Sparta. 

“Our opinion of women who take to whoring is low; on the

the inaugural assaults: an imprudent gesture, a tear, a twitch, a sob 
or a scream was enough, they were deprived of the honor of the 
subsequent ministrations and hence of the possibility of marrying.

“And bestiality used to be popular everywhere. Xenophon

hungry humans devour each other. Humanity? A sentimentality ; 
it has nothing whatsoever to do with Nature. Humanity? The 
child of dread, debility, and unwholesome prejudice. Can one ignore 
the fact that ’tis Nature which gives us both our passions and our 
needs? or that, in seeking fulfillment, these passions and needs 
proceed with total disregard for humane virtues? These humane 
virtues are thus foreign to Nature; they are thus no more than 
the blatant result of the egoism that has brought us to wishing to 
be at peace with our fellows in order to exploit them for our own 
pleasure. But he who has .10 fear of reprisals must be at great pains 
to subordinate himself to a duty which only those who tremble can 
possibly respect. Ah no, Juliette, no, there is no such thing as 
genuine pity, there is no pity save that wherefrom we calculate to 
profit. If at the moment we are in the throes of commiseration we 
pause and think and study ourselves deeply, then from the inward 
regions of our heart we'll detect a hidden voice cry: Thou dost shed 
tears to behold the sore plight of thine unhappy neighbor, thy tears 
bear witness to thine own wretchedness, or to thy dread of being 
more miserable still thax him for whom thou thinkest to weep. 
Well, what voice is this, i7 not that of fear? whence is this fear born, 
if not of egoism? 

“So let us then thoroughly destroy this pusillanimous senti- 
ment where we find it in ourselves; it must always be dolorous, since 
it cannot arise save through a comparison that plunges us back into 
woe. 

“Labor at the task; and when, beloved child, thy mind shall 
have perfectly apprehended the nullity, nay, the rank criminality 
that would subsist in acknowledging the existence of a bond linking 
thine own self up in brotherhood with others, then proudly declare 
with the philosopher : 

‘““Eh, to satisfy myself, why should I hesitate when the act 
I meditate, whatever thz ill it cause my fellow creature, may pro- 
cure me the most palpable pleasure? For, tentatively supposing that 
by performing whatever may be this act I do this fellow a wrong, 
by not performing it I must ineluctably do a wrong unto myself. In 
despoiling my neighbor of his wife, of his inheritance, of his child, 
I may, as I have just said, be committing an injustice toward him; 
but in depriving myself of these things whence I derive extremest 


Juliette & 193 


delight, I commit one toward myself: well, between these two 
inevitable injustices, shall I be so great an enemy of mine own self 
as not to prefer that from which I can extract a few agreeable little 
sensations ? If I do not act thus, ’twill be out of compassion. But if 
surrender to such a sentiment may have the dire consequence of 
causing me to renounce joys I covet so, I must summon up all my 
forces and cure myself of this painful, this disastrous sentiment, I 
must neglect nothing in order to prevent it, in future, from obtain- 
ing any access to my soul. Once I have succeeded (and of success I 
am certain if I gradually accustom myself to the sight of the suffer- 
ings of others), I'll never yield to any but the charm of satisfying 
myself; that charm will have no rivals, no other will beckon to me, 
I’ll have no further fear of remorse, for remorse cannot be but the 
aftermath of compassion, and this compassion I shall have extin- 
guished in myself ; I'll therefore follow my bent, all unafraid honor 
my penchants; I’ll value my own welfare, or my own pleasure, above 
woes which no longer touch me; and I'll sense that to let slip a real 
good from my grasp, because the having thereof would mean put- 
ting some other individual in an unhappy situation (a situation 
whose effects cannot make themselves felt upon me anymore), 
would be sheer ineptness, since it would be to love this stranger 
more dearly than I love myself, and that would be to violate every 
last law of Nature and every last element of good common sense.’ 
“Nor ought you to view familial ties as more sacred than these 
others, they are all equally fictitious. It is not true that you owe any- 
thing to the being out of whom you emerged; still less true that you 
are obliged to have any feeling whatever for a being that were to 
emerge from you; absurd to imagine that one is beholden to one’s 
brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces. Upon what rational basis can 
consanguinity establish duties; for what, for whom do we toil in the 
act of procreation? For ourselves; for anyone else? Certainly not. 
What can be our debt to a father who, amusing himself, incidentally 
created us? can we owe some debt to a son because once upon a 
time for the sake of diversion we spattered a little fuck into some 
womb or other? to a brother or a sister because the same womb was 
exercised upon more than one occasion? To the devil with the lot of 
these ties; needless to discriminate, they’re none of them serious.” 


194 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Oh, Noirceuil!” I cried, “how often have you provided proof 
of it... . And still you are loath to tell me—” 

“Juliette,” that amiable personage replied, “such avowals can 
be fitting reward for your behavior. I shall open my heart to you— 
in due time: when I feel you are truly worthy to hear the secrets I 
have to disclose. But before then you shall have to undergo several 
tests.” 

And his manservant having come to announce that the Minis- 
ter, an intimate friend oz Noirceuil, was waiting in the drawing 
room, we separated. 

I lost no time makinz a most advantageous investment of the 
sixty thousand francs I had stolen from Mondor. However sure I 
was that Noirceuil would have approved of the theft, I could not 
have mentioned it to him without also divulging my infidelity and, 
had he learned of that, my lover would surely have worried lest his 
own property become subject to my depredations; prudence coun- 
seled me to hold my tongue, and I turned all my thoughts to 
increasing, by like expedients, the sum of my revenues. The occasion 
soon presented itself in the form of another party organized by 
Madame Duvergier. 

The present enterprise was a mission to the home of an 
individual whose mania, 2s cruel as it was voluptuous, consisted in 
girl-whipping. We were four; at a café near the Porte Saint- 
Antoine I was joined by three charming creatures; a carriage was 
there waiting for us, and we were soon in Saint-Maur, at the 
delightful house of Duc Dennemar. My companions were of rare 
beauty, youthful and as fresh as they were sweet to behold: the 
eldest was under eighteen, Minette was her name; she pleased me so 
wonderfully well I could not resist caressing her passionately; 
another was sixteen years old, the last fourteen. Very exacting in 
the choice of her victims, from the woman who conducted us to 
Saint-Maur I learned that I was the only courtesan of the quartet; 
my youth, my looks had persuaded the Duc to suspend self-imposed 
rules which forbade him commerce with worldly women. The other 
three were seamstresses who had absolutely no experience in the 
work we were about to perform; they were decent girls, properly 
brought up, had been seduced only by the large sums the Duc 
offered, and by the assurance that, restricting himself to fustigation, 


Juliette & 195 


he’d not impair their virginity : each of us was to receive fifty louis; 
you shall decide whether or not we earned our pay. 

We were ushered into a magnificent apartment; our guide bade 
us undress and await the orders it would please his Lordship to 
signify to us. 

That was my opportunity to examine at leisure my three young 
colleagues’ naive graces, their delicate and gentle charms. What 
supple, willowy figures, what faultless skins, breasts that made one’s 
mouth water, thighs appetizing beyond words; for pink plumpness, 
for sweetness, their charming behinds were beyond comparison; I 
devoured all three and especially Minette with the most tender 
kisses, which they reciprocated so innocently, so movingly that I 
discharged in their arms. For the better part of an hour, awaiting 
the time when we’d have his Grace’s desires to cope with, we 
dallied there, frolickingly, and impetuously too, satisfying our own; 
and then at last a tall lackey, almost naked, came with instructions 
that we all four make ourselves ready, but that the eldest would be 
first. This placed me third on the list; when my turn came, I entered 
the pleasure. sanctuary of this contemporary Sardanapalus; and the 
experience I am going te relate is in no particular different from 
that which befell each of the other three girls. 

The cabinet in which the Duc received me was circular and 
everywhere paneled with mirrors; in the center was a column of 
porphyry, rising to a height of some ten feet, and before it was a 
dais. I was told to mount upon it; the valet we’d seen before and 
who served his master’s pleasure-ceremonies, attached my feet to 
bronze rings fastened to the block I was standing on, then he raised 
my arms, secured them by cords, drew them high above my head. It 
was only then the Duc approached; hitherto he had been reclining 
on a couch, quietly massaging his prick. Totally nude from waist 
down, a simple vest of brown satin covered his torso; his arms were 
bare to the shoulder; under his left arm he had a bundle of withes, 
thin and flexible, held together by a black ribbon. Of some forty 
years, the Duc had an exceedingly somber and harsh physiognomy, 
and | judged that his moral character was not much less severe than 
his outward appearance. 

“Lubin,” said he to his valet, ‘“‘this one looks better than the 


196 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


others. A rounder ass, finer skin. A more interesting face. "Tis a 
pity. She’ll but suffer the more.” 

So saying, the villain pokes his muzzle between my buttocks, 
first snuffles, then kisses, finally bites. I emit a shriek. 

“Goodness! She’s a0t insensitive. Too bad. We’ve scarce 
begun.” 

Thereupon I feel his talon-like fingernails dig deep into my 
buttocks, he rakes, he hauls, he tears my skin in several places. 
More screams from me only animate this scoundrel who next inserts 
his fingers into my vagira; they come out bringing with them the 
skin he has scraped from the walls of that delicate part. 

“Lubin,” he then murmured to his valet, exhibiting his 
bloodied fingers, “my dear Lubin, I triumph. Cunt-skin.” 

And he deposited it upon the head of Lubin’s prick, which 
therewith sprang up very stiff. It was at that point he opened a 
small cabinet the mirrors. concealed; he drew out a long garland of 
green foliage, I’d no idea what it was nor of what kind of leaves 
it was composed. Alas! he came near me and I saw at once that 
these were thorns. Seconded by the cruel agent of his pleasures, he 
twined them thrice or raore times round my body and ended by 
fastening them in a very picturesque but also very afflicting manner, 
for they lacerated the waole of my body and especially my breasts, 
against which he pressed them with the most ferocious affectations; 
my buttocks, however, were spared this accursed fire, for they were 
reserved for other use: the full expanse of the flesh his lashes were 
to belabor lay complete.y exposed to that libertine’s mercies. 

“We are about to begin,” said Dennemar when at last the 
arrangements were complete; “I earnestly request you to be patient, 
in as much as these proceedings may last a certain while.” 

The terrible storm about to break over my ass is heralded by 
ten relatively mild strokes. 

These delivered, he lets out a shout : ‘‘Now, by Jesus! let’s see 
what we can do.” 

Bringing both my buttocks under fire with a redoubtable arm, 
he applied two hundred cuts, never once pausing for breath. During 
the operation, his valet, kneeling before him, sought by sucking to 
extract the venom that rendered this beast so extraordinarily vi- 


Juliette & 197 


cious; and all the while he went on plying his withes, the Duc 
bawled at the top of his lungs: 

“Ah! the buggeress ... the bitch, the slut, the whore.... By 
the guts of Almighty God, I have no great fondness for women; if 
God made them, why can’t I exterminate them, whip them to shreds 
and tatters? Bleeding, is she? Well, at last... . By bloody fucking 
God, ’tis good, she bleeds... . Suck, Lubin, suck, my lad, ’tis very 
good, I see blood and I am happy.” 

And pressing his open mouth to my behind, he lapped up what 
he was so thrilled to see flow; then, continuing : 

“But, as you see, Lubin, I’m not stiff, and I’ve got to whip 
until I am, and once I’m stiff, to go on whipping till I discharge; 
well, that’s the program and our whore’s young. She’ll endure.” 

The gruesome ceremony starts off again; but with certain 
modifications: Lubin has ceased sucking his master; armed with a 
bull’s pizzle, he attacks the Duc who, while continuing to have at 
me, receives a hundred blows for every one he delivers. I am 
covered with blood, it streams down my thighs, I see it spreading 
in a crimson pool at my feet, staining the dais; punctured by the 
tight-wound thorns, slashed by the withes, I no longer know in 
what part of my body the pain is worst; and then it is.that my 
persecutor, weary of torturing me and, all asweat with lust, sub- 
siding upon the couch, finally orders me to be unbound. Swaying, 
only half-conscious, I totter toward him. 

“Frig me,” says he, kissing the traces of his savagery, “or, 
no, rather than that, frig Lubin, I prefer seeing him discharge even 
to discharging myself. And, what’s more, pretty as you aré, I doubt 
whether you'd succeed.” 

Lubin lays hands on me straight off. I am still decked in that 
terrible garland; the barbarian deliberately presses it against my 
skin while I pollute him; his position was such that, when he ceded 
to my wrist’s supple encouragements, his fuck would splash upon 
the face of his master who, steadily continuing to drive the splines 
into my flesh, to pinch my behind, was quietly frigging himself 
alone; the effect occurs: the valet discharges, the Duc’s features are 
drenched in sperm, but his own remains sealed in his balls, held in 
reserve for-a more lubricious scene still: I'll give you its details. 

“Get out of here,” he told me the moment Lubin had per- 


198 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


formed, “I’ve got to put your youngest companion to work before 
I call you back.” The door opened, in the adjoining room I dis- 
covered the two others wo’d gone before me: but, great heavens! 
what a state they were in! It outdid mine; the sight of their bodies 
—so pretty, so fair, so delicious—was now enough to inspire 
horror; the poor creatures were weeping, moaning at having con- 
sented to such a party; and I, prouder, of sterner stuff and more 
vindictive, I thought of nothing but material revenge. A door stands 
ajar, I peer throughit ints the Duc’s bedchamber, I stealthily enter. 
My glance falls at once upon three objects: a fat purse bulging 
with gold, a superb diamond, and a very fine timepiece. Hastily, I 
open the window; I notice, below and opposite, a little outbuilding 
forming an angle with the wall and close by the gate we entered 
when we came. Quick as a flash, I strip off one of my stockings, 
wrap the three objects i in it, drop the bundle into the bush growing 
' in the corner I’ve just mentioned; the bundle sinks down into the 
leaves, it’s out of sight. ] return to my companions. The very next 
moment Lubin came in to fetch us: to consummate his sacrifice, the 
high priest needed all fcur victims at once. The youngest had al- 
ready passed under the lash, and her ass seemed to have. been 
treated no less severely than ours had been; she was bleeding from 
head to toe; the dais had been removed. Lubin directed the four of 
us to lie down on the floor in the middle of the chamber; so skill- 
fully did he adjust us that little apart from our eight buttocks 
remained visible, I leave you to imagine the picture they presented. 
The Duc approaches this group; with his left hand Lubin caresses 
his Lord’s prick, with his right he drips boiling oil upon our asses; 
fortunately, the crisis shortly supervenes. 

“Burn them, sear them, scorch them, fry them!” cried his 
Grace as he ejaculated his fuck and blended it with the fiery liquid 
roasting our mutilated rumps, “‘burn these fucking whores, I’m 
discharging!” 

From this ordeal w2 arose in a condition which could be better 
described by the surgeon who was ten days laboring to efface the 
insignia left by this abominable scene; and he had a much easier 
time of it with me, upon whose behind, by good chance, only two or 
three drops of that boiling oil had fallen, than with the youngest 


Jultette & 199 


of the quartet, whom our tormentors, for some probably evil 
motive, had singled out to be treated to a veritable bath. 

Despite my hurts, and they were not inconsiderable, I kept 
my wits about me as we were leaving and, seizing a favorable 
moment, slipped over to the bush, plucked out my treasure, tucked 
it under my skirts, and thus recompensed for what I had suffered, 
was able to reckon the outing a success. Confronting Duvergier, I 
gave her a sharp scolding for having exposed me to such an insult- 
ing experience; what right had she to do so, I demanded, when 
knowing full well that I was no longer interested in being sacrificed 
to her greed. I went home, installed myself in my bedroom and had 
Noirceuil notified that I was unwell and would like to keep to my 
bed undisturbed for a few days. Not one whit in love with me—or 
with anyone else—still less given to wasting his time comforting 
the infirm or the languishing, giving evidence of a superb and 
doctrinal unconcern, Noirceuil never once presented himself at my 
bedside; his wife, milder of temper and more politic, visited me 
twice but abstained from shedding tears on my account; by the 
tenth day I was so well mended that I looked to be, if anything, in 
better condition than before. I then bent my gaze upon my catch: 
the purse contained three hundred Jouis, the diamond was worth 
fifty thousand francs, the watch a thousand crowns. As I had the 
other sum, I invested this one too; combined, they fetched nearly 
twelve thousand pounds a year; and it seemed to me that, thus 
endowed, it was high time I set to work for myself instead of con- 
tinuing to be the toy of the avarice of others. 


Thus did a year go by; during it I made my own arrangements 
and from what a number of adventures earned me pocketed the 
entirety. But, as chance so had it, none of these parties provided me 
an opportunity to exercise my thieving abilities; for the rest, I 
remained ever the pupil to Noirceuil, ever the butt of his lewd 
sports, ever the hated enemy of his wife. 

Although our relationship was characterized by indifference, 
Noirceuil, who, without loving me, had a wonderful fondness for 
my mind and conversation, continued to pay me a very handsome 
allowance; all my needs were supplied, and in addition I had twenty- 


200 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


four thousand francs a year for my pleasures; join to that the 
twelve thousand Jivres annuity I had bought for myself, and you'll 
agree I was not badly off. Caring rather little for men, it was with 
two charming women I satisfied my desires; they had two female 
friends who now and again were of the company, and we'd then 
execute every imaginable species of extravagance. 

One day, a friend cf the woman I was most attracted to so- 
licited my sympathy in behalf of a kinsman who had run into some 
major difficulties; I was told that I had merely to say a word to my 
lover, whose influence with the Minister would be enough to save 
the situation at once; if I wished, the young man would be very 
willing to come and recite the whole story to me. Moved, despite 
myself, by the desire t> make someone happy—a fatal desire 
wherefor the hand of JNature, who had not created me to be 
virtuous, was to see to my speedy chastening—I accept; the young 
man appears. My stars! what is my surprise to behold Lubin. I 
make an effort to conceal my emotion. Lubin assures me that he 
has left the Duc’s employ, he spins out a wild and utterly confused 
yarn; I promise to do what I can for him; the traitor walks out, very 
satisfied, says he, to have found me again, for he’d been hunting a 
year after me. For severz] days I heard nothing; I fretted over the 
unpleasant consequences this encounter might well have, I even felt 
a growing resentment agzinst the friend of my boudoir companion 
who had lured me into th:s trap, although I had no way of knowing 
whether or not she had done so intentionally. Such were my pre- 
occupations when one evening, as I emerged from the Comédie 
Italienne, six men halted my carriage, leveled pistols at the servants 
accompanying me, instantly forced me to get out, then pushed me 
into a waiting fiacre, shouting to the driver, by way of instruction: 
“To the Hopital!” 

‘(My God!” I said to myself, ‘I am lost.” 

Gathering courage z.t once, however, I turned to my captors: 

“Sirs,” I demanded, ‘‘have you not made a mistake ?” 

“I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle, we may perhaps be making 
a mistake,” replied one of those knaves whom I soon recognized as 
Lubin himself, “‘yes, we ure in all likelihood gravely mistaken, for 
tis to the scaffold we ought to conduct you; but if, until final in- 
quiries have been made, in sending you no farther than the Hopital, 


Juliette & 201 


the police, out of consideration for Monsieur de Noirceuil, are re- 
luctant to give you what you deserve immediately, we nonetheless 
trust the delay will be brief.” 

“Why, very well,” said I in a bold tone, ‘we'll see. But take 
care, my young blade, take care above all lest they who, for the 
moment fancying themselves in the stronger position, dare attack 
me so imprudently now do not come soon to regret their insolence.” 

I am cast into a foul little dungeon where for thirty-six hours 
I remain absolutely alone, hearing nothing but the coming and going 
of my jailers. 

You might perhaps be amused, dear friends, to know what 
my frame of mind was during this incarceration. I shall be frank 
with you: the following description is, I believe, exact. 

As in prosperity, calm in adversity; dismayed, no, coldly 
furious to discover myself a dupe for having given virtue’s case a 
single instant of heed; resolved—profoundly determined—never 
again to permit it the faintest entry into my heart; some amount of 
chagrin, perhaps, to see my fortunes temporarily ebb; but not a 
grain of regret, no remorse at all, not the shadow of a resolution to 
turn over a new leaf if I were ever to be restored to society ; not the 
tiniest intention to compose my differences with religion if I were 
to have to die. Such was I inwardly; what I say is true. Still in all, I 
was not absolutely free of anxiety—but in bygone days, when 
I was well-behaved, had I been any freer? Anxiety! ah, ’tis an 
old story. I prefer not to be pure and to put up with these familiar 
and tedious worries; I prefer having surrendered myself to vice 
than to discover myself blessed by a cowlike tranquillity, simple and 
stupid and full of an innocence I detest. O crime! yea, thy very 
stinging vipers are joys unto me: their penetrating fangs inject the 
venom that creates the divinest frenzy wherewith thou consumest 
thy faithful; all these quakings and fevers are pleasures; souls like 
ours have got to be subjected to shocks, affected; they cannot 
possibly be by virtue, whereof they have a loathing that surpasses 
what words can convey; and so we who wish to live, and who must 
be moved powerfully, we thirst after the maddening drink. ...O 
divine excesses! lacking which, life there is none! Yes, yes, let me 
be evil; let new possibilities for wicked deeds be offered me, and 
they’ll see how avidly I fly to commit them! 


202 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Such were my thoughts; you were curious to know them, I 
sketch them for you; and who is fitter to hear these confessions 
than you, my dearest friends? 

“Oh, Noirceuil!”’ I cried upon recognizing my lover, “what 
god led you here to find me? And, after all the grievous things I 
have done, how could J still be of interest to you?” 

He gazed at me. “Juliette,” said he a little later when we had 
been left in privacy, “I have nothing to reproach you for: the 
manner in which we have been living together eliminates the dis- 
agreeable circumstances that make reproaches possible. You were 
free. Love had no share in our arrangements. The single question 
was of confidence. Whatsoever might have been the similarity be- 
tween my attitudes and yours, you judged it expedient or necessary 
to refuse me that confidence. That’s all there was to it, nothing 
could be more natural, more acceptable. But what is neither natural 
nor acceptable is that you be punished for a bagatelle like this one 
they have arrested you for. My child, I admire your intellect, and 
you know it, you’ve known it a long time, and so long as the schemes 
it invents sort well with mine I shall always consent to them, better 
still, actively cooperate in their realization. Do not for one instant 
suppose that it is either from sentiment or from pity I am having 
you released from behind bars; you know me well enough to be 
persuaded that I could not be moved by either the one or the other 
of these two weaknesses. In this I have acted solely through selfish- 
ness, and I swear to you that if my prick were to get one ace stiffer 
from seeing you hang than from delivering you, by bleeding Christ, 
I'd not hesitate a second. But your company pleases me, I'd be 
deprived of it if they hanged you; you’ve done enough to deserve 
the rope, by the way--they were ready to use it on you; and I 
respect you precisely for that reason, you are entitled to my respect, 
it would be all the greater had you merited the wheel. . . . Come 
along with me, you’re free. No demonstrations, please, above all no 
expression of gratitude, I abhor it.” 

And remarking that, overcome, I was in spite of myself about 
to express thanks, Noirceuil backed off a pace and addressed these 
words to me: 

“Since you will persist, Juliette,” said he, his eyes flashing, 
“you'll not leave this place until I have proved to you the utter 


Juliette 2 203 


absurdity of the feelings to which, in defiance of your intelligence, 
your heart’s impoverishment seems to be causing you to succumb.” 

Then, having me sit down, and seating himself in a chair 
facing me, he entered into the matter: 

““My dear girl, you also know that I] am loath to let pass an 
opportunity to shape your heart or to enlighten your mind; there- 
fore allow me to teach you what gratitude is. 

“Gratitude, Jultette, is the word by which they denominate the 
sentiment felt and expressed in return for a boon whereof one has 
been the beneficiary; now, I must inquire into the motives of him 
who bestows a boon. Is he acting in his own behalf, or in ours? If 
in his, then you'll concede that we owe him nothing; if in ours, the 
ascendancy he thereby obtains over us, far from exciting gratitude, 
will certainly only arouse our jealousy, our rage: for this pur- 
portedly good deed has in actuality simply wounded our pride. But 
what is his ulterior design in putting us in his debt? Why, the dog’s 
behavior is transparent. He who obligates others, he who draws a 
hundred /ouis from his packet to hand them to a man in distress, 
has, appearances aside, in no wise acted in the name of the needy 
wretch’s welfare; let him peer into the depths of his heart, he’ll 
discover he has done nothing but flatter his vanity, he has labored 
for no one’s benefit but his own, whether it be that from giving the 
money to the beggar, he derives a mental pleasure which outstrips 
the pleasure he’d receive from keeping it for himself, whether he 
imagines that this act, become notorious, will win him a reputation; 
but no matter what the case, I see nothing but sheer grubby self- 
seeking and egoism here. Tell me, if you will, what I owe a person 
who does nothing save in his own interest? Well, rack your brains, 
finally endeavor to succeed in proving to me that he was thinking 
exclusively of the man he obligates by acting in the manner he has, 
that no one else knows anything of his deed, that report of it will 
never leak out, that he cannot have derived any pleasure from part- 
ing with that hundred Jowis since, to the contrary, the gift incon- 
venienced him, yes, acutely discomforted him, that, in a word, his 
deed is so damnably disinterested that not a grain of selfishness can 
be located anywhere in it or behind it; tell me all that and in reply 
I'll tell you, firstly, that it’s impossible and that, closely analyzing 
this benefactor’s gesture, we'll inevitably and invariably strike upon 


204 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


some fugitive, some hidden delight somewhere which will diminish 
the value of the deed and qualify its purity; but, even supposing 
this disinterestedness impeccable, you never need lie under the curse 
of gratitude, for by this deed, or trick, maneuvering himself into a 
position of superiority and you into one of inferiority, this man, in 
the best of cases, inflicts hurt upon your pride and his act mortifies 
something in you which, when offended, obliges you not to be 
thankful, but never to forget or forgive this that is unpardonable 
injury. From now on, this man, regardless of what he has done for 
you, acquires no right save, if you be just, to your undying enmity ; 
you will profit from his service—by all means—but you will detest 
him who renders it; his. existence will weigh burdensomely upon 
you, you will ever flush at the sight of him. If you learn news of his 
death, you'll inwardly rnark the date as a jubilee, you'll feel as 
though delivered from a curse, from a bondage, and the assurance 
of being rid of a person before whose eyes you cannot appear with- 
out sensing a kind of shame will necessarily become like a promise 
of joy—indeed, if your soul is truly independent and proud, you'll 
perhaps go farther, perhaps you'll take certain measures . . . per- 
haps you'll feel obliged out of duty to yourself... . Why yes, you 
may well, you certainly shall, go to the point of destroying the being 
whose existence plagues you; what other alternative have you? by 
all means yes, you’ll extinguish the life of this man as you would 
liquidate an eternally fatiguing burden; the service rendered you, 
instead of having provoked friendly sentiments for this benefactor, 
will, don’t you see, have produced the most implacable hatred. 
Consider well what I say, Juliette, and judge for yourself how 
incredibly ridiculous, ancl dangerous, it must always be to do good 
unto your fellow men. [n the light of my analysis of gratitude, 
observe, my dear, how frecious little I want yours, and think how 
eager I must be not to find myself in the grave position of having 
rendered you any service at all. I repeat it once again: in liberating 
you from this prison I clo nothing for your sake, it is in nobody’s 
interest but mine own that I act; believe that, absolutely; now let’s 
be off.” 

We betook ourselves to the office of the clerk; Noirceuil spoke: 

‘Your Honor,” said he, addressing one of the magistrates 
there, “this young lady, recovering her freedom, does not intend to 


Juliette 205 


conceal the name of the culprit who committed the theft of which 
she has been erroneously accused; my friend has just assured me 
that the individual you seek is one of the three girls who were there 
with her at the residence in Saint-Maur of Duc Dennemar. Speak, 
Juliette, do you recollect the girl’s name ?”’ 

“I. do indeed, Monsieur,” I answered, instantly perceiving 
what the perfidious Noirceuil was about. “She was the prettiest of 
the three, her age must be eighteen or nineteen, and she is called 
Minette.” 

“That is all we want to know, Mademoiselle,” said the man of 
the law; ‘“‘will you seal your deposition under oath?” 

“I shall, your Honor, of course,” I replied, raising my right 
hand toward the crucifix: ‘‘I do solemnly swear,” I intoned in a 
loud and clear voice, ‘‘and before God do hereby take sacred oath, 
that she who goes by the name of Minette is guilty and alone 
responsible for the theft committed in the house of Monsieur le 
Duc de Dennemar.” 

We left and promptly settled ourselves in Noirceuil’s coach. 

‘Well, my dove, without me you’d never have been able to 
play that nasty little trick. And yet, my role in the thing was mod- 
est: indeed, I merely set the stage; I felt certain, and I was right, 
that there was no need to prepare you for what was to come. You 
carried it off faultlessly. Kiss me, my angel. . . . I love to suck this 
lying tongue. Ah, you behaved like a goddess. Minette will be 
hanged; and, when one is guilty, ’tis delicious not only to wriggle 
out of a scrape but to have an innocent person put to death in one’s 
stead.”’ 

“Oh, Noirceuil,” I cried, “I do love you so! verily, of all the 
men in this world, only you were a fit companion for me; I failed 
you, and you shall make me regret it.” 

“Come, Juliette, have no fear,” Noirceuil replied; “‘you have 
committed a crime, do me the favor of feeling no guilt therefor; it 
is a virtuous act I expect you to repent. You had no cause to do this 
thing behind my back,” continued my lover as we drove toward his 
mansion. “I have no objection if you wish to do a little whoring, 
provided you are motivated by greed or lust; whatsoever has its 
origin in such vices is totally respectable, according to my view. But 
you ought to be cautious in your dealings with Duvergier’s clientele:

she trafficks with and procures for none but libertines whose cruel 
passions could easily bring you to your downfall: Had you specified 
your tastes to me, I myself could have arranged exceedingly profit- 
able encounters wherein the dangers would have been relatively 
slender and you would have been able to steal your fingers to the 
bone. For theft is an everyday affair, of all the whims to be found 
in man not one is more natural; I myself long had the habit; and I 
only rid myself of it by adopting others which are far worse. For 
petty vices there is no better cure than major crimes; the more one 
diddles virtue, the more one becomes accustomed to outraging it; 
and in the end, nothing short of enormity can wake the slightest 
sensation in us. Really, Juliette, you’ve missed acquiring whole 
fortunes at a stroke; unaware of your caprices, in the past year I’ve 
refused you to at least five or six friends who were burning to have 
a fair shot at you and with whom you'd have been quits after having 
simply bared your ass. Anyhow,” Noirceuil went on, “the source of 
all this trouble is that deplorable Lubin who, suspected by his em- 
ployer, swore to make the most thorough investigation. But, don’t 
fret, my, beloved, you’re avenged: Lubin entered Bicétre yesterday, 
he’ll stay there the rest of his life. You must know that it is to the 
excellent Saint-Fond, Minister and my great friend, you owe your 
deliverance and the suitable conclusion of the affair. The case 
against you was made up’, watertight; they were going to have you 
in the dock tomorrow; twenty-two ‘witnesses had been assembled 
to testify. Well, had there been five hundred, our influence would 
still have drowned them out; this influence is immense, Juliette, and 
between the two of us, Saint-Fond and I, we can regularly expect, 
by means of a word, a gesture, and whenever we like, to untie the 
rope knotted around the neck of the worst criminal on earth, and 
to have a saint mount the scaffold and die in his place. That’s how 
things are when idiot princes are on the throne. Everyone in their 
vicinity leads them around by the nose, mulcts them, and those drab 
robots, while fancying they do their own governing, actually reign 
through us, as our instriments; or, if you prefer, our passions are 
the sole sovereign in this kingdom. We could take our revenge upon 
Dennemar too, I’m equipped with all that’s needed for that; but 
he’s as libertine as we, his eccentricities prove it. Never attack 
those who resemble us, that’s my creed, you might subscribe to it 


Juliette & 207 


too. The Duc knows he was wrong in behaving as he did; he’s 
ashamed of himself today, he relinquishes title to the stolen goods 
and would even be very happy to see you again; I conferred with 
him, all he asked was that someone hang, and, you see, someone 
shall: he’s satisfied, so are we. My advice is, however, that you not 
visit the old miser; we know perfectly well that if he desires to see 
you it is only to persuade you to take pity on Lubin: well, don’t. I 
too once had that Lubin in my service, he fucked me very badly, 
cost me a great deal of money, and so disgusted me that I have, 
more than once, thought of having him packed off to some jail; he’s 
in jail now, it seems to me right that he stay there. As for the 
Minister, he’d like to meet you; it will be this evening, you’re to sup 
with him. He’s an excessively libertine individual. . . . Tastes, pro- 
clivities, fantasies . . . passions, vices ad infinitum; I hardly need 
recommend the extremest submissiveness—it is the one way in 
which you can demonstrate the gratitude whose effects you very 
mistakenly wished to shower upon me.” 

“My soul is being cast in the mold of yours, Noirceuil,” I 
answered coolly, “I cease offering you thanks now that you have 
made it plain that what you did, you did in your own behalf; and 
it would seem I love thee better and more since I’ve come to see 
that I owe thee nothing. As for the submission you request of me, 
it shall be entire; dispose of me, I am yours; a woman, I know my 
place and that dependence is my lot.” 

‘No, not absolutely,” Noirceuil rejoined, ‘‘your easy circum- 
stances, your wit, your character set you very definitely outside that 
form of slavery. To it I only submit wifely women and whores, and 
in this I comply with the laws of Nature who, as you must observe 
everywhere, requires that such beings crawl and fawn; intellect, 
talents, parts, wealth, and influence separate some from the other 
creatures whom Nature made to comprise the class of the weak; 
and when these exceptions merit inclusion in the class of the strong, 
they automatically fall heir to all the rights and perquisites of the 
latter: tyranny, oppression, impunity, and the liberal exercise of 
every crime—these are entirely permitted to them. I would have 
you a woman and a slave unto me and my friends; a despot unto 
everyone else .. . and I here and now swear that I shall avail you 
of the means. Juliette, hast passed a day and a half in prison? You 


208 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


deserve some sort of restitution. Rascal, I know of your twelve 
thousand a year—you hid that from me; it matters not, I was 
aware of your transactions, I'll get you ten thousand more to- 
morrow, and the Minister has asked me to give you this document: 
it entitles you to an annual pension of a thousand crowns, interest 
upon capital bequeathed to the hospitals; the sick will have a few less 
bowls of soup and you a few fripperies more, the universal scheme 
shan’t be dislocated for that. Which, it appears to me, makes five 
and twenty thousand pounds a year for you, not counting your 
appointments, which will continue to be paid to you in full and 
punctually. And so, my heart, you do well perceive that the conse- 
quences of crime are not always unhappy: a virtuous scheme, that 
of aiding Lubin, got you hurled into a dungeon; the theft executed 
in Dennemar’s house determines and motivates your prosperity; do 
you hesitate any more? Ah! commit your fill of crimes and more, 
we are presently acquained with the workings of your imagination, 
we expect much of you, and we guarantee that whatsoever you do, 
it shall be done with impunity.” 

“Can human laws be so incredibly unjust, Noirceuil? The in- 
nocent Gode groans in one prison cell, from another the guilty 
Juliette emerges covered with the blessings of fortune.” 

‘And it’s quite as it ought to be, all according to order, my 
sweet girl,” Noirceuil rejoined; ‘‘the luckless are the toys of the 
affluent, Nature’s laws subordinate the ones to the others; the weak 
are necessarily fodder to the mighty. Glance inspectingly at the 
universe, at all the laws which regulate its operations: tyranny and 
injustice, sole principles of every disorder, must be the fundamental 
laws of a cause which functions only through disorders.” 

“Oh, my friend!” said I, carried away by enthusiasm, “‘legiti- 
mizing all these crimes in my eyes, affording me, as you do, all the 
means I need for committing them, you so fill my soul with delight, 
with restlessness . . . with a delirium such as no words can express 
—and you still do not wish to have me thank you?” 

‘For what? You owe me nothing. I am in love with evil. I will 
hire anyone to do it. I arn acting selfishly in this instance as I do in 
every other.” 

“But I must show a token of my feelings for all you are doing 
for me—”’ 


Juliette & 209 


‘Then commit crimes in plenty and hide none of them from 
me.” 

‘Hide a crime from you? Never. My confidence shall be abso- 
lute, you shall be master of my thoughts as of my days, in my heart 
there shall be no desire born save I communicate it to you, every 
pleasure I shall know shall be shared with you... . But, Noirceuil, 
there is yet one little favor I’d beg of you: the woman who betrayed 
me by bringing that Lubin to see me, she powerfully excites my ire 
—I thirst for revenge. The creature must be punished; will you 
look to the matter at your earliest convenience ?” 

“Give me her name and address, we'll have her behind bars 
tomorrow. Her residence there will be permanent.” 

We reached Noirceuil’s house. 

“Here’s Juliette,” said Noirceuil, presenting me to his wife 
whose air was cool and reserved. ‘“‘She’s back with us again, safe 
and sound. The charming creature was the victim of a calumny; 
she’s the world’s best beloved girl and I beseech you, Madame, to 
continue to hold her in the high regard she for a quantity of reasons 
is entitled to expect from you.” 

Great Heaven! I said to myself, when once re-established in 
my luxurious quarters, I began to take stock of the splendid situa- 
tion I was going to enjoy—and to contemplate the revenue I was 
to become mistress of. Oh, great Heaven! the life I am to lead! 
Fortune, Providence, Fate, God, Universal Agent, whoever thou 
art, whatever be thy name, if ’tis thus thou dost treat those who 
surrender themselves into the arms of wickedness, how can one help 
but follow that career? Eh. ’Tis done, I'll never enter into any 
other. Divine excesses which they dare call crimes, you shall from 
now on be my gods, my only gods, my unique principles and my 
whole code of laws; I’ll cherish only you so long as there is breath 
unto me. 

My maids were waiting with my bath. I spent two hours there, 
two more at my toilette; fresh as a rose, I appeared at the Minis- 
ter’s supper, and, so they assured me, looked more lovely than the 
very sun itself, of whose light a few abject rogues had cheated me 
for the space of two days. 


‘Part 


WO 


Oy) ( Meese de Saint-Fond was a man of some fifty years: 
endowed with a keen wit, with much intelligence and 
much duplicity, his character was very traitorous, very ferocious, 
infinitely proud; it was in the supremest degree he possessed the art 
of robbing France, and that of distributing warrants for arbitrary 
arrest—the which he both sold at a goodly price and himself made 
use of, according to the dictates of his most idle fancy. Above 
twenty thousand persons of both sexes and all ages were at that 
moment, owing to his instructions, languishing in the various royal 
dungeons with which the kingdom is studded. “Of these twenty 
thousand souls,” he confided to me one day, a smile upon his lips, 
“not a single one is guilty of anything.” D’Albert, Chief Justice of 
the Parlement at Paris, was also at the Minister’s supper. It was 
only as we, Noirceuil and I, were arriving that he told me of 
D’Albert’s presence there. 

“You ought,” he counseled me, “‘to show as much deference 
to that gentleman as to the other, your fate was decided by him a 
mere twelve hours ago; he spared you. I had Saint-Fond extend an 
invitation to him so as to give you an opportunity to repay him for 
his thoughtfulness.” 

The seraglio at the disposal of the three men included, in 
addition to Madame de Noirceuil and myself, four charming 
whores. Of Duvergier’s selection, these creatures were still virgins. 
The youngest was called Eglée—she was thirteen, honey-haired, a 
little enchantress. Then there was Lolotte, fair as Flora; such a 
glow of health as distinguished her has become rare indeed; she 
was only lately turned fifteen. Henriette was sixteen years old and 
combined about her person more charms than did ever poet ascribe

to the Three Graces. Lindane was the eldest, she was seventeen, 
superbly made; the expressiveness of her eyes positively took one’s 
breath away. 

On hand as well were six youths ranging in age from fifteen 
to twenty; naked, their hair arranged in feminine style, they served 
the table. And so it was that each libertine had at his bidding four 
objects of lust, two of one sex and two of the other. None of the 
corps had as yet put in an appearance when Noirceuil led me into 
the salon and introduced me to D’Albert and Saint-Fond, who, 
after embracing me, da lying with me, praising me for a quarter of 
an hour or more, declared themselves well pleased to have me of 
the company. 

“It’s a delicious little rascal, this one,” said Noirceuil, ‘‘who 
through her unconditional submission to them would indicate to 
her judges how thankful she is they saved her life.” 

“T’d have regrettecl depriving her of it,” said‘D’ Albert. ““How- 
ever, it is not without good reason Themis is represented wearing a 
blindfold. And you'll agree with me that we ought always to have 
one over our own eyes whenever it is one such pretty little thing as 
this we have to judge.” 

“I promise her lifelong impunity,” said Saint-Fond, “total 
impunity. She is at liberty to do absolutely anything she likes, with- 
out fear. Regardless what she is guilty of, she shall be protected by 
me, and I swear to avenge her according to her wishes upon who- 
soever seeks to spoil or in any wise interfere with her pleasures, 
however criminal they may be.” 

“Let me take the same oath,” said D’Albert. “Indeed, I shall 
go farther: tomorrow there will be delivered to her a letter from 
the Chancellor, which will in advance nullify any court action any 
tribunal in the realm might eventually be induced to take against 
her. But, Saint-Fond, I 1ave yet something else in mind. So. far we 
have tended to dismiss crime, to connive at it; we ought rather 
encourage it, don’t you think? I'd like to have you arrange to have 
Juliette rewarded for the misdeeds I expect her to commit: bonuses 
in the form of pensions running from, let us say, two thousand to 
twenty-five thousand francs a year, the sums depending upon the 
feats she proves capable of.” 

“It should seem to me, Juliette,” said Noirceuil, “that you 


Juliette 215 


have just now been given the solidest motives both to allow your 
passions the broadest scope possible, and to hide none of your 
extravagances from us. But I really must say, gentlemen,” my 
lover continued before I had a chance to reply, “you put to wonder- 
ful purpose the authority vested in you by the laws and the monarch 
of this our beloved country.” 

“Eh, we do what we can with the means we possess,’ was 
Saint-Fond’s candid response; “‘one always labors best in one’s own 
behalf. Our office is to safeguard and promote the welfare of the 
king’s subjects; in ensuring our own and this engaging child’s, are 
we not carrying out our duties?” 

“Permit me to expand upon those remarks,” said D’Albert. 
“When accorded these powers we were not instructed to concern 
ourselves for the welfare of this or that isolated individual, we 
were merely informed: the authority we grant you is to further the 
happiness of the community. Now, it is impossible to render all men 
equally happy; therefore we hold our mission fulfilled when we have 
been able to satisfy several among the many.” 

“Yet,” said Noirceuil, whose sole aim in pursuing the con- 
versation was to provide his friends an opportunity to shine, “by 
shielding the guilty and dooming the innocent, your efforts con- 
spire rather to the ill of society than to the good.” 

“I very stoutly deny that,” Saint-Fond rejoined. “To the 
contrary, vice makes many more people happy than ever does virtue; 
and hence I am a far better servant of the public weal in my 
protecting the vicious than I would be in rewarding the virtuous.” 

“Fie! Such arguments are appropriate only in the mouths of 
scoundrels—”’ 

“My friend,” said D’Albert, “they are also your joy. It does 
not beseem you to contradict them.” ; 

“You are quite right,” was Noirceuil’s answer. “I think, 
though, that after all this talk we might do well to act a little. 
Would you care to have Juliette to yourselves before the others 
get here ?” 

“No, not I,” D’Albert said. “I am not prone to téte-a-tétes. 
What with the extreme need I have to be aided in these proceed- 
ings, I prefer to keep patience and wait till the assembly is 
complete.” 


216 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“For my part,” said Saint-Fond, “I rejoice at Noirceuil’s 
suggestion. Come along with me, Juliette; we shan’t be long.” 

He led me into a boudoir, closed the door, invited me to un- 
dress. He spoke to me while I removed my clothes. “I have been 
assured you are very compliant. My desires are a bit loathsome, I 
know, but you are intelligent. I have done you outstanding service; 
I shall do more: you zre wicked, you are vindictive—very well,” 
said he, tendering me six Jettres de cachet which required only to be 
filled in with the names 2f whomever I chose to have imprisoned for 
an indeterminate periocl, “here are some toys, amuse yourself with 
them; and here, take this, it is a diamond worth about a thousand 
louis, payment for the pleasure that is mine in making your ac- 
quaintance this evening. What? No, no, my dear, take it all, it is 
yours, it cost.me nothing. Money for purchasing the gem came 
from State funds, not cut of my pocket.” 

“Indeed, my Lord, your generosity leaves me confused—” 

“Oh, it will go farther still. I’d like to have you in my house- 
hold. I need a woman who will stop at nothing. I give dinners from 
time to time; you strike me as the ideal person for handling the 
poisoning.” 

‘What, my Lord, do you poison people ?” 

“There’s often nothing else to do with them. There are so 
many individuals one must put out of the way, you see. Scruples? 
I? Surely not. It’s simp.y a technical problem. I shouldn’t suppose 
you have any objections to poison?” 

“None at all,” I returned, “not in principle. I can swear to 
you that no conceivable crime affrights me, that every one I have 
perpetrated so far has delighted me unspeakably. It is merely 
that until now I have never administered poison; only afford me 
the chance, I ask no more.” 

“Charming creature,” Saint-Fond murmured. “Come, Juliette, 
kiss me. And so it is agreed? Good. Once again I give you my 
solemn oath: never shall you have any punishment to fear. Do in 
your own interest whatever you esteem profitable and pleasurable, 
dread no reprisals; should the blade of the law be turned against 
you, I shall deflect its edge, I shall do so every time, I promise 
that. Believe me. But you must prove—prove right now—that you 
are fit for the employment I have in mind. Look here,” and he 


Juliette & 217 


tendered me a little box, “tonight at supper I shall seat next to you 
that one of the whores I have selected for the test; ingratiate your- 
self, caress her thoroughly, feint is the sure cloak of crime, deceive 
her as artfully and as entirely as you can, and at dessert cast this 
powder into one of the glasses of wine that will be placed before 
her: its effect will be swift; by that token I shall learn whether you 
are or are not the woman I need. Succeed, and the post I propose 
is yours.” 

“Ah, my Lord,” said I with warmth, “I am at your orders. 
Issue them, issue them, let me show you what I can do.” 

“Delightful, delightful... . But now let us distract ourselves, 
Mademoiselle, your libertinage fetches my prick to a pretty stand. 
Eh, not too fast, however; we must undertake nothing until I have 
impressed upon you the high importance of observing very strictly 
this formula: you must be respectful. Respectful in all things, con- 
stantly, unfailingly. My titles to respect are many, I demand that 
they be acknowledged; I am a proud man, Juliette. Under no 
circumstances shall I use the familiar second person with you; never 
say thou to me. Address me, instead, as my Lord, speak to me in the 
third person so far as possible, and when you are in my presence 
study to assume a reverent attitude, posture, and mien. Apart from 
the eminent position I occupy, my birth is illustrious, my fortune 
enormous, and my credit superior even to the King’s: my station 
and condition make vanity unavoidable: the powerful man who, 
beguiled by the always meretricious popularity he may sometimes 
enjoy, allows himself to be approached too nearly, suffers as a 
consequence a loss of face, of prestige, is humiliated, abased, sinks 
into the estateless ruck. Nature put the great on earth as she did 
the stars in the sky: they are to shed light upon the world, never 
to descend to its level. Such is my pride that I like servants to kneel 
before me, prefer always to employ an interpreter when holding | 
parley with that vile rabble known as the people; and I detest 
everybody who is less than my peer.” 

“In that case,” said I, ‘“‘my Lord must despise a great share 
of society, since there are very few persons in this world who can 
pretend to be his equal.” 

“Precious few, Mademoiselle, that is correct; which is why I 
despise everybody on earth except the two friends who are here 


218 > THE MARQUI3 DE SADE 


this evening, and a very limited number of others: for all the rest 
my hatred is unbounded.” 

“But, my Lord,” I took the liberty to say to this despot, “‘do 
not your libertine caprices now and again constrain you to step 
down from the pinnacle upon which, so it does seem to me, you 
would prefer to remain at all times?” 

“No,” Saint-Fond replied, ‘‘there’s no contradiction here, it’s 
all of a piece: for minds conformed like mine, the humiliation im- 
plicit in certain acts of libertinage serves only as fuel to the fire of 
our pride.’ 

By then I was standing naked before him. “Ah, Juliette, it is 
a magnificent ass I see there,” praised the haughty lecher, exposing 
himself. “They told me it was superb, but upon my soul it surpasses 
its reputation. Bend forward, let me put my tongue to it... .O 
God!” he cried, all dismayed, ‘‘it’s spotlessly clean! Did Noirceuil 
neglect to tell you in what state asses are to be when presented to 
me?” 

“No, my Lord, of this Noirceuil told me nothing.” 

“T like them unwiped, beshat. . . . I like them perfectly foul 
—but this one is scrubbed, fresh as new-driven snow. Well, we shall 
have to resort to another; here you are, Juliette, behold mine—it 
is the way I wanted yours to be, you'll find shit in there aplenty. 
Kneel facing it, adore it, consider the honor I accord you in per- 
mitting you to do my ass the homage an entire nation, nay, the 
whole wide world aspires to render it—oh, how many people 
would be overcome with joy could they but exchange places with 
you! if the very gods were to descend into our midst it would be to 
vie for this favor. Suck, lick; drive deep your tongue; seize your 
chance, my child, this is not the moment for backwardness.” 

And though my misgivings were not negligible, I vanquished 
them; it was to my interest to prove myself mettlesome. I did all 
this libertine desired of ne, I sucked his balls, I let him fart into 
my mouth, shit on my breasts, spit and piss all over my face, tweak 
my nipples, slap me, kick me, pinch me, stoutly fuck my ass, and in 
doing so become much aroused, then discharge into my mouth, and 


1 The paradox is readily to be explained: one does that which no one else is able 
to do; hence, one is unique in one’s species. It is this singularity pride feeds upon. 


Juliette & 219 


I swallowed his sperm, for he had ordered that I swallow every 
drop. I did everything, and owing to my docility all went well. 
Divine effects of wealth and influence! Your desires obliterate virtue 
and will, wither all power to resist; and the hope of being kindly 
received by you causes everyone, whosoever he be, to fawn at your 
feet, mindful only to do your least bidding. Saint-Fond’s discharge 
was admirable, forceful, convulsive; it was accompanied by the 
most vigorous, the most impetuous blasphemies, pronounced in a 
very loud voice; quantitatively his expenditure of sperm was con- 
siderable, the temperature of that sperm was high, in consistency 
it was dense, it was savory to the palate, his ecstasy was energetic, 
he thrashed violently about, intense was his delirium: a handsome 
figure of a man was he, his skin was very fair, his ass as shapely as 
any to be found, his balls the size of a hen’s eggs, and his well- 
muscled prick was probably six inches in circumference and seven 
in length, ending in a head measuring at least two inches long, and 
‘twas far, far thicker there than at the stem. Saint-Fond was tall, 
nicely proportioned, his nose was aquiline, he had long lashes, fine 
dark eyes, strong white teeth, and his breath was sweet; when done 
he asked me whether it were not true that his fuck was exquisite. 

“Pure cream, my Lord, pure cream, I’ve never swallowed any 
to equal it.” 

“You may expect to be granted the honor of that fare from 
time to time,” said he, ‘“‘and you will likewise feast upon my shit 
when we become truly well acquainted. So now, Juliette, kneel down, 
kiss my feet, and thank me for all the favors I have condescended 
to bestow on you today.” 

I obeyed, and Saint-Fond embraced me, vowing himself posi- 
tively enchanted with me: the filth I was swimming in was got rid of 
with the help of a bidet and some perfumes. We quit the boudoir; 
as we were traversing the apartments separating it from the 
assembly hall, Saint-Fond reminded me of the box I was carrying. 

“Indeed,” said I, laughing, ‘‘does crime linger in your brain 
even after the illusion has been dissipated ?” 

“What,” the dreadful man retorted, “did you then mistake 
my proposal for something conceived in a moment of excitement, 
and destined to be forgot straightway the moment was over?” 

“I presumed it was only that.” 


220 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“You were wrong; this is one of those necessary things whose 
anticipated doing very certainly stirs up our passions but which, 
though conceived during a transport, must nonetheless be calmly 
carried out afterward.” 

“But are your friends privy to it ?”’ 

“Can you doubt ?” 

“There will be a scene.”’ 

“Not at all. We are accustomed to this. Ah, if the rose bushes 
in Noirceuil’s garden could speak and say to what nutriments they 
owe their crimson magnificence . . . Juliette, my dear Juliette, such 
ones as are we consider that there is not, that there cannot be, 
One execution too many.” 

“Then be easy, my Lord. I have sworn obedience to you, I 
shall keep my oath.” 

We reappeared in the others’ midst; they had been waiting 
for us, all the women were by now there. We had no sooner re- 
turned than D’Albert signaled the desire to repair to the boudoir 
with Madame de Noirceuil, Henriette, Lindane, and two youths, 
and it was not until later when I saw him in action that I was able 
to form a precise idea of his tastes. Those of us who were left after 
the departure of D’Albert and his troupe fell to lewd frolicking: 
the two little girls, namely Lolotte and Eglée, by means generally 
similar to those I had employed shortly before, endeavored to 
stiffen Saint-Fond afresh; they succeeded; Noirceuil, watching, had 
himself bum-fucked whil2 kissing my buttocks. Saint-Fond caressed 
one of the lads and held several minutes of private conversation 
with Noirceuil; when they came back both seemed in high fettle, 
and the rest of the company having joined us, we all betook our- 
selves to supper. 

Imagine, good friends, imagine my surprise when I beheld 
Madame de Noirceuil guided very ceremoniously to the table and 
invited to take the chair next to mine. I leaned toward Saint-Fond, 
who had placed himself to my left, and whispered, ‘My Lord, 
is this the woman you have designated to be the victim?” 

“She is,” replied the Minister, “‘and pray master your dismay, 
it does you scant credit in my eyes—another hint of this pusil- 
lanimity, let me warn you, and you shall lose my esteem forever.” 

So I sat down; the meal was no less delicious than libertine,

the women, only partially and loosely clad, to the lechers’ finger- 
ings exposed all the charms the Graces had lavished upon them. One 
had a new-budding breast to hand, another fondled a buttock 
whiter. than alabaster; it was only about our cunts there was not 
‘much ado made, such objects seldom proving of any real concern 
to men of that breed; firmly of the opinion that to apprehend 
Nature one must seduce her, and that to seduce her one must often 
outrage her, these rascals are often wont to perform their devotions 
at those very shrines which Nature, so it is alleged, forbids us 
to approach. When wine of the finest vintage and the most suc- 
culent viands had heated the imaginations of the company, Saint- 
Fond laid hands on Madame de Noirceuil: the atrocious crime 
that dastard’s perfidious brain had been meditating against the 
luckless creature was stiffening his device prodigiously; he bears 
her off to a couch at the farther end of the room and embuggers 
her, bidding me shit into her mouth in the meantime; four youths 
are disposed in such wise he can frig two, one with his right hand, 
one with his left, a third is encunting Madame de Noirceuil, and 
the fourth, perched above me, gives me his prick to dandle and 
pump; a fifth bum-stuffs the Minister. 

“Ah, Jesusfuck !”” Noirceuil exclaims, ‘“‘ ’tis an enchanting sight. 
To my knowledge there is nothing prettier than to see your wife 
fucked this way. My dear Saint-Fond, I beseech you not to coddle 
her.” 

And raising Eglée’s buttocks to mouth height, he has a morsel 
of shit fresh out of the little one, the while sodomizing Lindane, 
and the sixth boy penetrates him anally. Tis Saint-Fond in the 
center, Noirceuil on the right; D’Albert on the left now completes 
the picture: he sodomizes Henriette as he colls the ass of the boy 
busily fucking the Minister and with both hands gropes about and 
kneads whatever is within reach. 

But words cannot describe that divinely voluptuous scene; 
only an.engraver could have rendered it properly, and yet it is 
doubtful he would have had time to capture those many expressions, 
all those attitudes, for lust very quickly overwhelmed the actors 
and the drama was soon ended. (Jt is not easy for art, which lacks 
movement, to realize action wherein movement is the soul; and 


obey 


222 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


this is what makes engraving at once the most difficult and thankless 
art.) 

We returned to tabe. 

“Tomorrow,” said the Minister, “I am to prepare and dis- 
patch a lettre de cachet; the man concerned is guilty of some rather 
unusual misconduct. He is a libertine who like you, Noirceuil, adores 
giving his wife to be fucked by strangers; this wife—it will strike 
you as incomprehensible, I know—this wife has been so silly as to 
complain about usage that a good many other women crave. The 
respective families have become entangled in the affair, I have been 
asked to have the husband confined.” 

“Excessively severe punishment,” Noirceuil muttered. 

‘Far too lenient in my opinion,” said D’Albert; “there are 
dozens of countries where such fellows are put to death.” 

‘Hear that, will you! ’Tis but too typical. You gentlemen of 
the law,” said Noirceuil. “are happy only when blood is shed. For 
you, Themis’ scaffglds are boudoirs: pronouncing the death sen- 
tence, your pricks harden; and you discharge when it is carried out.” 

“True, that not uncommonly happens,” D’Albert admitted, 
“but where is the disadvantage in converting one’s duties into 
pleasures?” 

“Quite,” said Saint-Fond. ‘“‘Common sense is on our side. But 
to return to the case of the man we were discussing a moment ago. 
You will agree with me that it is shocking, the number of wives 
who are behaving like fools nowadays.” 

‘It is lamentable,” said Noirceuil. “One comes across nothing 
but women who fancy that fulfilling their duty to their husbands 
begins and ends with preserving their own honor, and who, in order 
that they acquire and remain in possession of this shoddy virtue of 
theirs, expect those husbands to pay the price of constantly fore- 
going everything that stands at variance with conventional pleas- 
ures. Forever garbed ir. the silly raiments of a good name and 
mounted astride the hobbyhorse of virtue, and supposing they 
are beyond reproach, whores of this category imagine they are 
entitled to unbounded and unconditional respect, that they are 
therefore at liberty to act like utter cretins and certain to be for- 
given every piece of stupidity and clumsiness. It is disgusting, I say; 
who would not a thousand times over prefer a wife who, though 


Juliette % 223 


the most arrant slut, were to camouflage her vices behind absolute 
complacency, behind utter submission to every one of her husband’s 
caprices? Ha! fuck, fair ladies, fuck to your hearts’ delight; fuck 
your pretty heads off, we couldn’t care less; we have only one 
concern, and it is this: that you anticipate our desires, that you 
satisfy them all with alacrity and unscrupulously; endeavor to 
please us, metamorphose yourselves, assume many roles, play at 
this sex and that, be children so as to afford your husband the 
passing great delight of whipping you, and you may be sure of it: 
treat him thus thoughtfully and comprehendingly and he will take 
little heed of anything else. The course of action I have just out- 
lined is to my knowledge the only one capable of mitigating the 
horror of wedlock, the most appalling, the most loathsome of all 
the bonds humankind has devised for its own discomfort and 
degradation.” 

“Ah, Noirceuil, there is gallantry lacking in you,” reprimanded 
Saint-Fond, somewhat forcefully squeezing the breasts of the wife 
of his friend; “‘you are after all speaking in the presence of your 
spouse.” 

Noirceuil grimaced. ‘Eh, so I am. That situation will be 
altered before long.” 

“But what’s this?” cried the mischievous D’Albert, casting 
a look of feigned surprise at the poor woman. 

“‘We are due to be separated.” 

“Due to be separated! How dreadful,” said Saint-Fond, 
greatly aroused, and while frigging a youth with his right hand, 
continuing to paw and to wring Madame de Noirceuil’s pretty 
dugs with his left. “‘Do you mean to say you are going to sever 
your ties, ties so sweet?” 

‘‘Have they not lasted long enough?” 

‘Very well then,” Saint-Fond replied, still frigging a prick, 
still molesting two bubs, “if you really intend to leave your wife, 
I'll take her—I’ve always thought very highly of her, of her 
gentleness, of the humane quality about her. . . . Kiss me, bitch!” 

She was weeping from the pain Saint-Fond had been inflicting 
on her for a good quarter of an hour; they were of her sighs the 
libertine paused to drink, her tears he licked away before resuming: 
“Bless me, Noirceuil, to separate from so lovely a wife”—and 


224 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


he bit her—‘‘so sensitive a wife’—and he pinched her—“why, my 
dear Noirceuil, it’s sheer murder.” 

‘You know,” said D’ Albert, ‘‘between the two of us I believe 
that’s exactly what Noirceuil has in mind, a murder.” 

“How ghastly!” Saint-Fond exclaimed; he had got Madame 
de Noirceuil to rise and was now clawing her buttocks while she 
fisted his tool. ‘“‘There’s nothing for it, my friends. Plainly, I’d 
best embugger her afresh; it may help her forget her other woes.” 

“Yes,” said D’Albert, just then taking hold of her frontwise, 
“and in the meantime I’.] encunt her. Come, let’s hem her in and 
do her between us.” 

‘And what would you have me do, pray tell?” Noirceuil asked. 

“Meditate,” said the Minister. “You'll hold the candle, you'll 
meditate, you'll plot.” 

“I can put my time to better use,” rejoined the barbarous 
husband; “leave my beloved helpmeet’s head alone, I wish to have 
her tearful countenance within view, I’ll bestow an occasional slap 
upon that image of distress the while I embugger this dear little 
Eglée; and two of the boys will take turns sounding my bum, and 
I'll pluck hairs from Henriette’s cunt and Lolotte’s, and will watch 
Lindane and Juliette being served, one cuntwardly and the other 
in the asshole, by the two lads remaining.” 

And it was so, very hot was the affray and very prolonged; 
the three libertines discharged at last, Dame Noirceuil emerging 
from their clutches all battered and bruised—D’Albert, for in- 
stance, had taken a great bite out of one of her breasts. Following 
the example of those geritlemen, and stoutly fucked by two of the 
pederastic youths, I swear that I too discharged unspeakably: 
flushed, my hair all disordered, I heard my performance and looks 
praised when we had done; it was Saint-Fond who caressed me 
especially. 

“Is she not superb in this state!’ he repeated. “(How crime 
embellishes her!” And ke applied his lips to most every part of 
my body, sucking them indiscriminately. 

We did not return to the table, but everybody continued to 
drink there where he lay; very agreeable, this, and one is much 
quicker drunk that way. Alcohol began to have its effect almost 
at once, the women began to tremble; blazing glances were bent 


Juliette & 225 


upon them, and I noticed that when they were spoken to the terms 
employed were threatening as well as foul. However, two facts 
were readily to be perceived: firstly, that the storm then gathering 
would pass me by, and that Madame de Noirceuil was to bear the 
brunt of its fury; I dismissed my fears. 

Shunted out of Saint-Fond’s hands into those of her husband 
and from his into D’Albert’s, the unhappy lady was in sorry straits 
already; her breasts, her arms, her thighs, her buttocks, in short, 
every fleshy part of her was beginning to exhibit palpable evidence 
of the ferocity of those blackguards, when Saint-Fond, his prick 
of great size again and purple, seized her and gave her twelve 
resounding thwacks about the shoulders and the behind, then six 
equally vigorous slaps upon the face, that being in the way of pre- 
lude; next, he placed her in the center of the dining room and 
immobilized her, her feet were fastened to the floor, there being 
eyebolts sunk there; ropes attached to the ceiling held her arms 
raised above her head. As soon as she was thus tied a dozen 
lighted candles were set between her thighs, in such wise that 
some of the flames scorched the interior of her vagina, others the 
vicinity of her anus, singeing her pubic hairs till they smoked, and 
searing her flesh; whereof the visible result was much writhing 
and many tremors and, upon the lady’s lovely face, a sublime ex- 
pression that declared all the voluptuous anguish of dolor. Holding 
up another candle, Saint-Fond considered her attentively during her 
ordeal, having his prick sucked by Lindane throughout and his ass- 
hole tongued by Lolotte; nearby, Noirceuil, being fucked while 
nibbling Henriette’s buttocks, announced to his wife that she was 
going to go thus to her death; and D’Albert, embuggering a youth 
and fondling Eglée’s ass, exhorted Noirceuil to deal yet more 
rudely with his unfortunate spouse—that unfortunate creature, 
she who was bound to him in holy matrimony. Catering to the 
divers needs of the company at large, for that was my role, I 
remarked that the candle-ends being too short, the victim was not 
suffering anywhere near the desirable degree of pain; so I raised 
the candlesticks by setting them upon a stool; Madame de Noir- 
ceuil’s frantic screams earned me the hearty applause of her tor- 
turers. And now Saint-Fond, who was becoming giddy, ventured an 
atrocity: the rogue caught up a candle, waved it beneath the lady’s 


226 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


nose for a moment or two, then burned her eyelashes and- indeed 
almost the entirety of one eye; D’Albert too picked up a candle, 
and he toasted one of her nipples, while her husband set her hair 
afire. 

Greatly moved by this dramatic spectacle, I egged the actors 
on and induced them to essay another stunt. Upon my recommenda- 
tion Milady was drenct.ed with brandy; for a brief instant she 
resembled a living torch, and when the blue flames died out, lo! 
it was not a pretty sight to behold, from head to toe one great 
burn covered her body. IMy idea had been a great success; there is 
no imagining how I was praised for having conceived it. Fearfully 
aroused by that piece of villainy, Saint-Fond forsook Lindane’s 
mouth and with Lolotte still in tow, for he would not have her 
leave off sucking his vent, he embuggered me straightway. 

“And now what shall we do to her?” Saint-Fond asks me, 
running his tongue deep into my mouth and plunging his prick far 
into my bowels. “Think, Juliette, invent something; you are in- 
spired, whatever you propose is divine.” 

“There are yet a thousand tortures she could be made to 
undergo,” I reply, ‘one more piquant than the other.” And I am 
about to suggest a few ‘when Noirceuil approaches us and points 
out to Saint-Fond that it might be wiser to have her swallow the 
dose immediately lest from exhaustion she lack strength enough 
to enable us to appreciate and enjoy the effects of the poison. 
D’Albert’s opinion is consulted, he agrees with Noirceuil most 
emphatically; the lady is untied and turned over to me. 

“Poor wretch,” I say to her after having introduced the 
powder into a glass of Alicante, “‘drink this, it will refresh you. 
It will improve your spirits. You'll see.” 

Without a murmur the precious fool does as she is told and 
once she has imbibed al the fatal mixture, Noirceuil, lodged to 
the hilt in my ass hitherto, withdraws and moves nearer the victim, 
eager to feast his eyes upon her antics from close on. 

“You are going to clie,” he informs her; “you are, I suppose, 
reconciled to the fact ?”’ 

“T am confident,” D’Albert remarks, “that Madame is sen- 
sible enough to realize that when a wife has lost her husband’s 
affection and esteem, when she no longer but wearies and is 


Juliette 227 


offensive to him, the simplest course open to her is to bow grace- 
fully out of the picture.” 

“Oh yes! Oh yes!” the unlucky woman shrieks. ‘I ask only 
to die, kill me, that is my one request! In the name of Heaven, be 
quick !”” 

“The death you crave, foul buggeress, is already brewing in 
your guts,” says Noirceuil, his prick being frigged by one of the 
catamites; “Juliette did the thing. Such is her attachment to you 
she would never have forgiven us had we deprived her of the joy 
of administering the coup de grace.” And, utterly blinded by lust, 
quite unhinged, Saint-Fond embuggered D’Albert who, bending 
complacently before his friend’s sodomistic onslaughts, delivered 
to a pretty lad the equivalent of what he was receiving from the 
Minister, whose anus I was tonguing industriously. 

“Come, we are proceeding in too disorderly a fashion,” said 
Noirceuil, seeing from his wife’s contortions, now begun in earnest, 
that she merited closer watching. 

He has a carpet spread in the middle of the room, upon it 
the victim is made to recline and we group in a circle around her. 
Saint-Fond bum-stuffs me’while frigging a boy with either hand. 
D’Albert is sucked by Henriette, he sucks a prick while frigging 
another with his right hand; with his left he molests Lindane’s ass; 
Noirceuil’s prick enters Eglée’s rectum, a prick passes into his 
own, he sucks yet another and inserts three fingers in Lolotte’s 
ass while the sixth youth fucks her amain. The crises begin; most 
horrible they are, for there is no describing the effects of that 
poison : so violent were the poor woman’s thrashings that at certain 
moments she was quite rolled up in a ball, then it was as though 
an electrical shock were paralyzing her entire body, foam flecked 
her lips, her screams were perfectly horrible; but they were not to 
be heard save by us, the necessary precautionary measures had 
been taken. 

‘‘Ah, but it is delicious,” Saint-Fond sighed the while he toiled 
in my ass; “I don’t know what I wouldn’t give to sodomize her in 
that state.” 

“Nothing easier,” said Noirceuil, “just have a try. We'll hold 
her still.” 

Firmly grasped by the youths, the patient, her efforts not- 


228 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


withstanding, is forced into position and there gapes her asshole; 
and into it Saint-Fond plunges his member. 

““Godsfuck!’ he exclaims, “I must discharge!” And discharge 
he does. D’Albert replaces him in the breach, then Noirceuil; but 
when his stricken wife feels him there, her strugglings become so 
furious, she escapes away from those who have her pinioned and, 
quite out of her mind, hurls herself at her torturer; alarmed, 
Noirceuil backs off, the circle is formed anew. 

“Let her be, let he> be,” says Saint-Fond, just returned into 
my ass; “it is wise to keep clear of a rabid beast-when it is in 
death’s throes.” 

Howbeit, Noirceuil, stung, insulted, wishes to have his 
revenge; he is in the midst of devising fresh torments but Saint- 
Fond stays his hand, explaining to his friend that anything further 
done to the victim now must only detract from the pleasure of 
beholding the action of the venom. 

“Gentlemen,” say I, “it’s not only watching she needs; I 
believe the services of a confessor are about to be required.” 

“Let her go to the devil, he’ll shrive the whore,” said Noir- 
ceuil, at that point being sucked by Lolotte; “aye, let her go to 
all the devils there be. If ever I desired that a hell exist it was 
hoping that her soul would make its way there, and to be able, so 
long as there is breath in me, to relish the thought of her suffering.” 

It was that imprecation, so it appeared, that precipitated the 
final crisis. Madame de Noirceuil yielded up her soul, and our three 
rascals discharged concurrently, vying with one another in shame- 
less blasphemy. 

“This,” said Saint-Fond, squeezing his prick, evacuating the 
last drop of fuck therefrom, “this that we have just accomplished 
shall surely stand as one of our finest deeds; I am highly pleased. 
Ridding the world of that prude has long been one of my ambitions; 
her husband was no more tired of her than I.”’ 

“Faith,” D’Albert put in, “you surely fucked her no less often 
than he.” 

‘Indeed, more ofter,”’ my lover rejoined. 

“In any case,” Saint-Fond said to Noirceuil, “I intend to 
honor our agreement; you have sacrificed your wife, you shall have 
another : my daughter is yours. I am by the way delighted with this 


Juliette & 229 


poison we have used; it gives excellent results, and I think it a 
great pity we cannot witness the deaths of all the people we 
destroy by this means. Alas! one cannot be everywhere at once. 
But as I was saying, my daughter is yours, gentle friend; and may 
heaven bless this occasion on which I acquire a most aimiable 
son-in-law and the assurance of not being betrayed by the woman 
who supplies me with these poisons.” 

Here Noirceuil leaned toward Saint-Fond and whispered 
what I guessed was a question in his ear; the latter nodded affirma- 
tively. The Minister then turned in my direction. “Juliette,” said 
he, “‘you will come to see me tomorrow, I will more thoroughly 
discuss with you what I have only touched upon today. Remarrying, 
Noirceuil may dispense with your presence in his house; I propose 
to establish you in mine; and I trust that the reputation which 
dwelling in my proximity will confer upon you, the money and the 
comforts I design to shower upon you, will prove ample compensa- 
tion for the loss you are about to incur. You please me mightily; 
your imagination is brilliant, your phlegm in crime is exemplary, 
your ass is splendid, according to my belief, you are ferocious and 
libertine; thus do I judge that you possess the virtues I admire.” 

“My Lord,” said I, “most gratefully I accept all you deign 
to offer me, but I must tell you, since I cannot hide the fact, that 
I love Noirceuil: I do not relish the prospect of losing him.” 

“Nor shall you lose me, my child, we shall see each other 
frequently,” was the reply of Saint-Fond’s intimate friend and 
future son-in-law, ‘‘we shall spend the better hours of our lives 
together.” 

“So be it,” I said, ‘‘under those circumstances there is nothing 
I am not willing to consent to.” 

To the youths and whores the drastic and certain conse- 
quences of the slightest indiscretion on their part were made 
abundantly clear; much impressed, they swore never to speak a 
word of what had passed that evening; Madame de Noirceuil’s 
remains were buried in the garden; and those of the company bade 
one another farewell. 

An unforeseen contingency was to delay Noirceuil’s marriage 
and the realization of the Minister’s schemes as well; nor when I 
went to see him the next day toward noon was he there to greet me. 


230 ed THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


The King, singularly content with Saint-Fond, and trusting him 
unreservedly, had summoned him that same morning, confided a 
secret mission to him, and Saint-Fond had taken his departure from 
the city immediately; later, upon his return, he was awarded the 
cordon bleu, and an annuity of one hundred thousand crowns. 

Oh yes, I said to myself when I learned of these favors, how 
very true it is that fate awards the evildoer, and how very much 
the imbecile he who, enlightened by such examples, were not all 
the more ardently to forge ahead in crime and to its furthermost 
limits. 

In letters Noirceuil received from the Minister during his 
absence, I was enjoined to locate a house and to array it splendidly. 
And so, as soon as I was in command of the necessary funds, I 
rented a magnificent mansion on the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore; 
purchased four horses, two charming carriages; hired three lackeys, 
strapping tall fellows and very handsome; found a cook, two scul- 
lions, a housekeeper, a reader, three chambermaids, a hairdresser, 
two downstairs maids and a pair of coachmen; I acquired quantities 
of the finest in furnishings; and the day the Minister came back to 
Paris I betook myself to his home. I had just attained my seven- 
teenth year, and I think I can say that for looks I compared very 
satisfactorily with the prettiest women in the capital; my figure was 
like unto that of the Goddess of Love, and art heightened what 
was mine of natural beauty. The contents of my wardrobe were 
worth well above one hundred thousand francs, a hundred thousand 
crowns was the value of the jewelries and diamonds I wore. Wher- 
ever I went every door was open to me; and that day the Minister’s 
domestics bowed low. He was awaiting me, he was alone. I began 
by mentioning the tokens of royal esteem which had been showered 
upon him, my congratulations were of the sincerest, and I sought 
leave to kiss his hand; hz accorded it provided I kneel while doing 
so; familiar with the dimensions of his pride, his arrogance, I 
catered to them and adjusted my behavior to his wishes: it is by 
base flattery and abjectness that the courtesan, like the courtier, 
buys the right to be insolent to everybody else. 

Spoke he: ‘Madame, you see me in the hour of my glory; the 
King has dealt largely with me, and I dare say according to my 
deserts; my position has never been so solid nor my fortune so 


Juliette 231 


great. If, as I propose to do, I make you the beneficiary of some 
small part of His Majesty’s bounty, it shall be upon the obvious 
conditions; in view of the projects we have executed jointly, I be- 
lieve I can rely upon you, you have acquired my total confidence. 
But before I descend to particulars, kindly look at these two keys, 
Madame. This first one opens the vault where is stored all the 
gold due to be yours if you serve me well; and this other is to the 
Bastille: in it there is a vacant cell, it is reserved for your lifelong 
occupancy should you fail of obedience or discretion.” 

“Confronted by such alternatives, one of doom, the other of 
glittering prosperity—I hardly need indicate which of the two I 
elect unhesitatingly. So place your whole trust in her who shall be 
absolutely your slave, and put away all doubts of her loyalty.” 

“You will have the charge of two important functions, Ma- 
dame. Be seated please, and heed me.” Not thinking what I was 
about, I was taking an armchair when Saint-Fond gestured me 
toward an ordinary straight-backed chair; he cut me short in the 
middle of my profuse apology, and continued in this wise: 

‘The post I hold, and in which it is my aim to remain yet a 
good while, for it is a rewarding one, obliges me to sacrifice no end 
of victims; in this casket there are various poisons, you shall em- 
ploy them pursuant to the instructions I issue you. Upon those 
individuals who come actively at cross purposes with me the cruelest 
are used—see, they are labeled; the speedy upon those whose exist- 
ence is merely a vexation to me and whom I prefer to waste no 
time dispatching from the world; and these, marked slow, are for 
those with whom I am obliged to proceed unhurriedly, whether be- 
cause of political reasons or simply to divert suspicion away from 
myself. Depending upon the specific case, the envenoming will be 
accomplished either here in Paris, at your home or at mine, or in 
the provinces, or, again, abroad. 

‘“‘Now as to the second of your functions—in all likelihood 
the more arduous of the two; it will also prove the more lucrative, 
however. Endowed with a very puissant imagination, everyday 
pleasures meaning nothing to me any more, Nature having given 
me a very fiery temperament, eminently cruel tastes, and where 
means are concerned all that is needed to satisfy these furious pas- 
sions, I shall, whether at your residence or at Noirceuil’s or at the 


232 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


home of some one or other of my friends, sup in the libertine man- 
ner twice a week; at each of these routs a minimum of three vic- 
tims must infallibly and obligatorily be sacrificed. Per year, if we 
deduct the time spent in traveling—you will accompany me on some 
of my journeys—that comes, I believe, to approximately two hun- 
dred whores, the procuring whereof is to be your concern only; 
howbeit, these victims must meet certain specifications. Firstly, 
Juliette, the ugliest of them all has got to be at least as well-favored 
as yourself; I accept none younger than nine, nor above sixteen 
years of age; each must be a virgin, of excellent birth, titled if pos- 
sible, wealthy in any case—” 

‘“‘And you mean to say, my Lord, that you destroy all those?” 

“Indeed I do,, Madame. Murder is the sweetest of all my 
voluptuous practices, there are no limits to my fondness for blood, 
shedding it is the foremost of my passions; and to satisfy them all, 
come what may and hang the price, there’s the foremost of my 
principles.” 

Seeing that Saint-Fond was waiting for my response, I said, 
‘(My Lord, what I have revealed to you so far of my character 
must, I should think, be sufficient proof that I cannot possibly fail 
you; my self-interest and tastes are your guarantee of my good 
faith. Yes, my Lord, it is very true, Nature gave me the same pas- 
sions she gave you . . . tie same cast of mind, too; and he who in- 
dulges in these things out of love of them will surely serve you 
better than he who obeys in order to please you rather than him- 
self: the bond of friendship, a similarity of taste: such, be sure of 
it, such are the ties that most powerfully bind a woman like me.” 

“As regards friendship, bah! refrain from alluding to it, 
Juliette,” the Minister said very sharply; “I hold that sentiment 
as empty, as illusory as love. Whatever originates in the heart is 
false; for my part, I believe in the senses alone, I believe alone in 
the carnal habits and appetites . . . in self-seeking, in self-aggran- 
dizement, in self-interest. Aye, self-interest, of all possible bonds, 
shall always be the one ir. which I shall place the greatest faith; and 
I would therefore have i: that the arrangements I am going to con- 
clude with you be overwhelmingly to your personal advantage. 
Should taste develop later on as decoration to the self-interes 
structure, well and good ; but tastes are fickle, they change with t] 


Juliette %& 233 


years, the time may even come when one is guided by them no 
longer—but one always is by self-interest. So let us reckon up your 
little fortune, Madame: Noirceuil has assured you ten thousand 
livres per annum, I’ve provided you with three, you had twelve 
before; that makes twenty-five; and here are twenty-five thousand 
more—put this contract in a place of safekeeping—where are we 
now? Fifty? Fifty. Now let’s enter into a few details.” 

The Minister was not displeased to have me prostrate myself 
before him; when I was done airing my thanks he bade me return to 
my chair and hear him out. ~ 

“T am quite as aware as you, Juliette, that with such a slender 
revenue you could not hope to provide for the two weekly suppers 
I shall require, nor dream of maintaining the house I ordered you 
to take; hence, I shall give you a million to defray the cost of those 
suppers; but bear it well in mind that they are to be of unparalleled 
magnificence, the most exquisite meats, the rarest wines, the most 
extraordinary fowl and fruits will be served at them always, and 
immense quantity must be joined to the finest in quality: even if we 
were only two to dine, fifty courses would obviously be too few. You 
will have twenty thousand francs apiece for the victims, and that 
is not overmuch in view of the standards they shall have to meet. 
You will be allotted a further thirty thousand francs gratuity for 
every ministerial victim you immolate personally; there will be 
roughly fifty of these each year, this article thus coming to some 
fifteen hundred thousand francs annually, to which I am adding a 
monthly twenty thousand francs for your appointments. Unless I 
have erred in my computations, this, Madame, totals to a yearly 
six million seven hundred ninety thousand francs; we shall throw 
in two hundred ten thousand more for your pocket money, supple- 
mentary charges, and divers trifles, so rounding the sum out to an 
even seven million, whereof, if you like, you may bank fifty thou- 
sand, yours by contract. Will this do, Juliette?” 

Suppressing all outward signs of a tremendous elation, for 
greater yet was the greed consuming me, I was silent a moment, 
pursing my lips and seeming to take counsel with myself; then I 
ventured to draw the Minister’s attention to certain facts: the 
duties he was prescribing me were, to say the least, quite as onerous 
as the sums of which he was making: me mistress were considerable; 


234 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


I was eager that he never be caused the slightest disappointment; it 
seemed to me altogether possible, nay, likely, that the huge expenses 
I was going to have to .ncur would largely exceed the resources at 
my disposal; and that, besides. . . . 

“You need say no more,” the Minister interrupted; ‘‘you have 
spoken in an idiom I apprehend perfectly, and you have persuaded 
me that you have your own interest ever in view. That, Juliette, 
is precisely what I wish; for I now know that I shall be irreproach- 
ably served. Stint on nothing, Madame, and you will have ten mil- 
lion a year; we have no reason to be niggardly. A contemptible 
fool, that statesman wo neglects to have the State finance his 
pleasures; and if the masses go hungry, if the nation goes naked, 
what do we care so long: as our passions are satisfied? Mine entail 
inordinate spending; if I thought gold flowed in their veins, I’d 
have every one of the people bled to death.” 

“Adorable man,” I cried, “your philosophy positively inflames 
me. A moment ago you detected the motive of selfishness in me; it 
is now doubled by that of taste, believe me, and be persuaded also, 
that my zeal in your service shall be owing a thousand times more 
to worship of such pleasures than to any other cause.” 

“I have witnessed ‘you in action,” Saint-Fond rejoined; ‘‘your 
conduct augured well. And indeed, how could you help but be 
enamored of my passions? The human heart is capable of engen- 
dering none more delicious than they. And he who is in a position 
to say—No prejudice hinders me, I have overcome them all; on the 
one hand, I possess the influence that legitimates my every gesture; 
on the other, the means necessary to committing every crime—I 
tell you, Juliette, such a one is the happiest of mortals. Ah. That 
reminds me, Madame, of the patents of impunity D’Albert prom- 
ised you when last we su'sped together. I have the papers here, they 
arrived this morning; it was I who requested them of the Chancel- 
lor, not D’Albert—whose habitual forgetfulness, you understand, 
goes with his post.” 

This multitude of <avorable developments, this windfall, the 
prospects opened up to rne—I was as though spellbound, and quite

under the ancien régime and fersonified it. We have not promised to portray them 
as beauties, but authentically; we shall keep our word. 


Juliette & 235 


speechless. Saint-Fond brought me forth from my trance when he 
drew me to him and, asking, ‘“‘How long shall it be ere we begin, 
Juliette?” kissed me and ran his hand down my behind, into which 
he promptly popped a finger. 

‘““My Lord,” said I, “I must have three weeks at least to ready 
all the organization.” 

“Three weeks then. Today is the first of the month, Juliette. 
I shall sup at your residence on the twenty-second, at seven.” 

‘There is something else, my Lord,” I went on. “You have 
deigned to describe your tastes to me; I may perhaps tell you 
something of mine. You are already aware of those concerning the 
crimes I shall be able to commit with you; this document allows me 
to steal to my heart’s desire; pray furnish me the wherewithal to 
revenge myself against an eventual enemy.” 

“Come with me,” said Saint-Fond. 

We entered the office of a clerk. 

“My good sir,” said the Minister, ‘‘your attention, please. 
“Look closely at this young lady; remember her. I order you to 
sign and to deliver to her, upon her simple request, as many lettres 
de cachet as she wishes, whenever, and for whatever places of de- 
tention she chooses.” 

We returned to the chamber we had formerly been in. “There, 
you are prettily equipped,” said the Minister, ‘‘now show what you 
can do. Burn, trample, hack away, all France is yours; and what- 
ever crime you perpetrate, regardless of its magnitude, its gravity, 
perpetrate it intrepidly, for fear you need-not, you shall get away 
scot-free, you have my word. You shall have more: as I have told 
you already, thirty thousand francs for every crime you commit on 
your own initiative, on your own behalf.” 

My friends, I shall not attempt to describe the impact these 
promises, these prospects had upon me. 

It is well nigh incredible, said I to myself. From the outset 
blessed by Nature with an imagination tending to extravagance, 
here am I now, rich enough to satisfy my every whim, to achieve my 
every ambition, strong enough to defy any retaliation. No; there 
are no inward joys comparable to this knowledge that I am power- 
ful and hence free; no lubricity to equal the effect of this one upon 
the soul. : 


236 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“So now, Madame, let us seal the bargain,” said the Minister. 
‘‘Here’s a little gift for you, a mere bauble,” he went on, handing 
me a casket where there were five thousand J/ouis in gold, and twice 
that in gems and jewelry; “take it along, and don’t forget the box 
of poisons.” 

Then he led me into a secret room where the furnishings were 
both sumptuous and bizarre. 

“Henceforth upon entering this place, and while you are here, 
your condition will be that of a common whore; and at all other 
times you will be one of the greatest ladies in the kingdom.” 

‘‘Wherever I am, iny Lord, I shall be your slave, your ad- 
mirer eternally, and the very soul of your most exquisite pleasures.” 

I undressed. Thrilled at having found a suitable accomplice at 
last, Saint-Fond performed horrors. Of his ways I have told you 
something, I now discovered more; leaving his house I might feel 
as though I had not my peer in all the world, but when I was in his 
company, he degraded me unutterably; when it was a question of 
lust, he was truly the filthiest man that can be conceived, the most 
despotical, the cruelest. He had me do reverence to his prick, his 
ass; he shat, | had to make a god of his very mard; but he also had 
this curious mania, he had me soil those very things that symbolized 
all that his pride was founded upon; he insisted that I shit upon 
various honorific insigniz. and badges and he wiped my ass with his 
cordon bleu. I owned to him my surprise at this last gesture. 

“I would have you see, Juliette, that such rags and ribbons 
designed to dazzle fools do not overawe a philosopher.” 

“But a short mome.t ago you obliged me to kiss them ?” 

“True enough, but just as I pride myself on what these dittle 
fripperies represent, so it also flatters my pride prodigiously to 
profane them. All this—-’tis just a quirk such as makes sense only 
to libertines of my species.” 

Saint-Fond’s prick was up in extraordinary size; I discharged 
in his embrace: for those with an imagination like mine, the ques- 
tion is never whether this or that is repulsive, irregularity is the sole 
valid consideration, and anything is good provided it be excessive. 
Something told me he had a burning desire to have me eat his shit, 
I sought his permission to do so, obtained it, he was in ecstasies; he 
devoured mine, between mouthfuls tonguing my vent at length. He 


Juliette & 237 


showed me a portrait of his daughter, scarcely fourteen years old, 
and as lovely a creature as one could behold; I begged him to in- 
clude her at one of our forgatherings. 

‘She is not here,” he told me; “‘were she, you’d have already 
seen her in our midst.”’ 

“T take it you are not sending her to Noirceuil without having 
enjoyed her first ?” 

“That is quite correct,” he replied; “I would be heartbroken 
to allow someone else to pluck such delicious first fruits.” 

‘So you have ceased to love her ?” 

“Love her? Juliette, I love nothing, nobody, none of us liber- - 
tines loves anything at all. That child gave me a good many erec- 
tions; she no longer excites me nowadays, I’ve wearied myself toy- 
ing with her. I am giving her to Noirceuil, whom she heats exceed- 
ingly—it is a matter of mutual convenience, that’s all.” 

“But when Noirceuil tires of her?” = 

‘Why, you know the usual fate of his wives; in all likelihood 
I shall participate in the ceremony myself. I have in others; they 
are always stimulating. They are always worthwhile. That’s the 
sort of thing I like... .” 

And his prick soared another inch. 

“My Lord,” said I, “it seems to me that if I were in your 
position, I’d be tempted to abuse my authority at certain moments.” 

“When stiff, you mean to say?” 

“Yes.” 

“It sometimes happens.” 

“Oh, my Lord,” I began. Then: “‘Let’s massacre some inno- 
cents, shall we? The idea makes my brain whirl.” 

I was frigging him, one of my fingers was tickling his asshole. 

“One moment,” said he, removing a sheet of paper from his 
pocket and unfolding it, ‘‘I have but to put my signature to that, 
and a very attractive person dies tomorrow. She is in prison at the 
moment; I issued the warrant upon the request of her family. Their 
single grievance is that she prefers women to men. I have seen her; 
she is charming; I amused myself with her the other day, and since 
then I have been so anxious lest she blab that my one thought, or 
rather desire, has been to get rid of her.” 

‘Ah, my Lord, she’ll talk if given the chance, she’ll talk, your 


238 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fears are only too well founded; so long as that girl is alive, you 
will be in constant danger. Therefore, and if I implore you to do 
so, it is because your safety depends on it, sign that paper.” And 
taking it from his hand, I placed it flat against my buttocks. “There 
is a quill on that desk, and an inkhorn.” 

He signed his name. 

‘I am quite willing to carry it to the clerk myself,” I said. 

‘As you like,” said he, “but one thing at a time, presently I 
must discharge, Juliette. That all reach its proper climax I have 
need of further assistance.” He rang. ‘‘Pray be not alarmed,” he 
went on, “‘it is a ritual.’”” And the next moment a pretty youth ap- 
peared in the doorway. 

“Kindly kneel, Juliette, this young man is to bestow three 
blows of a cane upon your shoulders, the traces will last only a few 
days; afterward he will hold you steady while I embugger you.” 

And the newcomer, having stripped off his pantaloons, 
straightway gave his behind to be colled by the Minister who licked 
it complacently. 

In the meantime, I knelt down; the youth picks up his cane and 
so smart were the three cuts he gave me the marks showed for the 
space of a fortnight. While the boy was laying on, Saint-Fond, 
sitting opposite me, watched with lewd curiosity; then he came up 
and examined the stripes on my skin, grumbled about their faint- 
ness, bade the boy take L old of me; and while sodomizing me vigor- 
ously, very vigorously, kissed the hinderparts belonging to him who 
was accessory to the operation. 

“Ah, fuck my eyes!” he cried, loosing his seed, ‘‘ah, God be 
double-fucked, the whore’s marked.” 

The mysterious yoith withdrew. It was not until long after- 
ward that an event I will relate in due course shed light on his 
character and identity. 

Saint-Fond escorted me out of the boudoir; and once we had 
left it, reassumed his fo-mer thoughtful air. 

“Take the caskets with you, Madame,” said he, “and remem- 
ber that our schedule calls for operations to begin three weeks 
from today. Very well. _ibertinage, crime, discretion, Juliette, and 
your welfare is assured, Adieu.” 

The very first thing I did was examine the order of execution 


Juliette & 239 


whereof I was the bearer. Great heavens, what was my amazement 
to discover that here in black and white were instructions to the 
supervisor of the convent-prison in question secretly to poison— 
whom? None other than Sainte-Elme, that charming novice I had 
fairly worshiped during my sojourn at Panthemont. Another per- 
son would perhaps have torn up that baneful piece of paper; not I. 
For I was too far advanced in my criminal career to quail; I did 
not even pause, no, nor waver for an instant, with determined step 
I betake myself to Sainte-Pélagie, where Sainte-Elme had been 
languishing three long months behind bars; I transmit the order 
into the hands of the head warden, ask to see the culprit; I interro- 
gate her, she declares the Minister offered to arrange her libera- 
tion in return for her favors, and that she did with him all that it 
is possible for a woman to do. The lecherous monster had omitted 
‘ not a single episode in his repertory of abominations; mouth, ass, 
cunt... the beast had defiled her everywhere, and as consolation 
for this evil treatment she had been given nothing but the hope of 
having her freedom restored to her. 

“I have with me the document that will put an end to your 
misery,” I say, kissing her. 

Sainte-Elme thanks me, repays my caresses tenfold. . . . I no- 
tice that betraying her is moistening my cunt. . . . The following 
day she was dead. 

Faith, said I to myself upon learning of the outcome of my 
scurvy deed, I can do better than that. I was made for great things. 
I feel it. 

And setting myself promptly to work preparing the stage for 
the scenes Saint-Fond was to enact, within the space of three weeks 
I was, as I had promised, able to provide the first of his suppers. 

Six excellent procuresses I had taken into my employ supplied 
me, for my debut, three young sisters spirited away from a pious 
retreat in Meaux, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years of age, and 
positively celestial in face and figure. 

That first evening the Minister appeared in the company of 
a man in his sixties. Upon arriving he encloseted himself for several 
minutes with me, inspected my shoulders, and appeared irritated at 
finding no traces left of the stripes he had had inflicted upon me at 
our last encounter. Scarcely did hie touch me; but he advised the 


240 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


greatest respect and the profoundest submissiveness in my behavior 
toward the individual who had come with him, he being one of the 
foremost personages at the Court, a prince. The latter entered the 
room as soon as Saint-Fond left it. Forewarned by my lover, I 
turned and exhibited my behind as soon as he had shut the door. 
He approached, a spyglass in his hand. ‘‘Fart,” he commanded, 
“or be bitten.” 

Unable to satisfy him with all the celerity he desired, I felt a 
sudden pain in my left buttock: his teeth had caused it. They left 
deep marks in my flesh. He walked around to in front of me; it was 
a severe and unlovely visage I looked into. 

“Put your tongue in my mouth.” 

I did so. Whereupon he said: “Belch or be bitten.” 

But seeing that I couldn’t obey, I backed away quickly enough 
to avoid the trap. The old rascal flies into a fury, he catches up a 
bundle of withes and belabors me for a quarter of an hour; then 
he stops and walks around to in front of me again. 

“You behold the li:tle effect even these activities I am fondest 
of have upon my senses. nowadays; consider,” said he, “this limp 
prick nothing hoists. Nothing. To bring it at all aloft I'll be 
obliged to cause you much hurt.” 

“There'll be no need for that, my Prince,” said I, “‘since you’re 
soon to have at your disposal three delicious objects whom you can 
torment in whatever way you like.” 

“Aye, but you are attractive . . . your ass,” said he, fondling 
it apace, “pleases me inf nitely; I'd like to stiffen for its sake.” 

So saying he rids himself of his clothing and upon the mantel 
lays a diamond-studded timepiece, a gold snuffbox, his purse over- 
flowing two hundred /ouis, and two superb rings. 

“Let’s have another try now. Here, take hold of my ass, you 
must pinch and bite it hard, fearfully hard, and while you do that, 
frig me with the supplest possible wrist. Good, excellent!” he cried 
upon perceiving some slight improvement in his state; ‘now 
stretch out on this couch, will you, and let me prick your buttocks 
with this hatpin.” 

I lie down. “Steady,” says the Prince. But when I emit a loud 
scream and seem about to faint away at a second thrust, confused 
and aflutter and dreading lest by using his mistress somewhat too 


Juliette <b 241 


roughly he give offense to the Minister, the Prince scurries from 
the room, hoping his departure will quiet me. I fling his clothes 
into an adjoining chamber, pounce upon his valuables, and hur- 
riedly rejoin Saint-Fond, who inquires of me, “Is there anything 
amiss ?”” 

“Nothing at all,” say I, “but from being in too great haste 
fetching his Highness’ clothes I let the door to my boudoir shut to, 
the key is inside and these English locks—there’s no opening them. 
But never mind; Monsieur has his shirt and breeches here, we can 
defer the interview he desires until some later time.” 

And I draw my two guests out into the garden where every- 
thing has been put in readiness to receive them; the Prince forgets 
his belongings, dons the costume I tender him, and is mindful only 
of the pleasures yet to come. 

The weather that evening was faultless, we were beneath a 
bower of roses with lilac bushes all around us; a multitude of can- 
dles furnished the light, our seats were three thrones supported on 
artificial clouds whence came the scent of the most delicious per- 
fumes; in the center of the table was a very mountain of the rarest 
flowers, set amongst which were the jade and porcelain cups and 
plates we were to drink from and dine off; the service was of gold. 
No sooner had we taken our places than the bower opened over- 
head and before our eyes there descended a fiery cloud: upon it, 
the Three Furies and, prisoned in the coils of their serpents, the 
three victims destined to be sacrificed at this feast. The Furies 
alighted from their aerial car, each chained the victim in her keep- 
ing to boxwoods near where we were sitting, then stood by in 
readiness. No previously established program decided the order of 
that meal, it was to shape itself according to the wishes of my 
guests; anything you happened to wish you simply demanded, and 
the Furies brought it to you instantly. Above eighty widely varying 
dishes are called for, every one is served up in a trice; ten kinds of 
wines are requested, all ten flow, everything is there in_plenty, in 
profusion: 

‘Nicely done,” my lover remarked. “I trust your Grace is 
satisfied with my directress’ initial effort?” 

“Enchanted,” answered the sexagenarian, his head ree)ing 
from the abundance of food and spirits, and his tongue thick al- 


’ 


242 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ready. ‘Indeed, Saint-Fond, I envy you your divine Juliette—I 
have never clapped eyes on a fairer ass.” 

“Nor have I,” the Minister owned; “but I suggest we leave it 
alone for a while and concern ourselves with those belonging to our 
Furies who, if I’m not greatly mistaken, are superbly fleshed also.” 

And at that hint, the three goddesses, impersonated by the 
three loveliest girls my purveyors had been able to locate for me 
after ransacking the whole of Paris, immediately bared their be- 
hinds to the two libertines, who kissed them, licked them, gnawed 
them with much relish and complete abandon. 

“My good Saint-F.ond,” the Prince stuttered, “‘shall we have 
ourselves flogged by these Furies ?” 

“With rose branches,” Saint-Fond proposed. 

And there are our lechers’ backsides exposed, being cruelly 
lashed now by garlands of flowers, now by the Furies’ snakes. 

“Very lubricious indeed, these exercises,” remarked Saint- 
Fond, resuming his chai: and pointing to his towering device; ‘‘say 
now, my Prince, are you: stiffening a little?” 

‘“‘No,” the hapless old dotard answered, “I require more po- 
tent stimulants than any of these; immediately when I enter into 
debauch, I like to be environed by atrocities in uninterrupted se- 
quence, I like to have a] that men hold sacred violated in the in- 
terests of my pleasure, all that is holy soiled by my doing—” 

“You are not a humanitarian then, my Prince?” 

“T abhor mankind.” 

“I strongly doubt,’ Saint-Fond continued, ‘‘whether at any 
moment in the day I for my part am not animated by the most 
vehement impulse, or caressing same black scheme, to cause harm 
to humankind; there is no more execrable species. Be he powerful, 
then man is dangerous, and no tiger in the jungle can match him 
for wickedness. Is he puny, weak, woebegone? then how base he is, 
how vile, how disgusting within and without! Oh, many a time have 
I blushed at having been born in the midst of such creatures. My 
one comfort is that Nature loathes them no less than I, for she de- 
stroys them daily; I wish only that I had as many means as she at 
my command for contriving their undoing; had I, I’d wipe the lot 
off the face of the earth.’ 

“But you—august beings that you are,” I broke in, “do you 


Juliette %& 243 


really think of yourselves as human? Why no! no, when one bears 
so little resemblance to the common herd, when one dominates it 
so absolutely, it is impossible to be of its race.” 

“You know,” said Saint-Fond, “she is quite right; we are so 
many gods; as it is with them, so is it with us—do we not have but 
to formulate desires to have them satisfied instantly? Ah, is it not 
obvious that among men, or rather, above men, there is a class so 
superior to the weaker sort as to be what of old the poets termed 
divinities ?” 

‘As for myself, I am no Hercules, I sense that I am not,” said 
the Prince, “‘but I fain would be Pluto; it would please me mightily 
to have the task of dismembering mortals in hell.” 

“And I should like to be Pandora’s box, that the ills emergent 
from the depths of me might destroy them all piecemeal.” 

Some groans were heard at this point; they had been uttered 
by the three chained victims. 

“Unloose them,” said Saint-Fond, “and bring them hither.” 

The Furies detached them and led them before my two guests; 
and since no females can combine grace and beauty in a higher de- 
gree, I leave you to imagine to what lecherous attentions they were 
subjected straightway. 

“Juliette,” said the Minister, transported, “‘you are a charm- 
ing and able creature; plainly, you have the touch of a master, 
these results authorize the statement. . . . Come, let’s lose our- 
selves amongst these arbors, amidst these flowers, come, in shadow 
and silence let us give ourselves up to all our brains may dictate. 
. .- You had some ditches dug?” 

“Suitably close by every spot likely to become a theater for 
your atrocities.” 

“Good; and no lights along the pathways ?” 

“None; darkness beseems crime, you shall enjoy it in its full 
horror. Let us be off, my Prince, and stray into these labyrinths, 
and accept the challenge to do our worst.” 

We all of us set forth together, the two libertines, the three 
victims, and I. Entering an alley flanked by hedges, Saint-Fond 
exclaimed that he could not proceed another step without first fuck- 
ing; and seizing the youngest of the girls, the villain blasted both 
her maidenheads before rejoining us ten minutes later. During his 


244 eb THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


absence, I sought to excite the old Prince; but in vain. Nothing 
seemed able to rouse his prick. 

“Do you then intend not to fuck?” Saint-Fond asked him, 
laying hands on the second girl. 

‘“‘No, no, go on, depucelate,” ariswered the old lecher, “I'll 
restrict myself to vexations; pass them on to me one by one when 
you’re through with each.” 

And getting the youngest of those little girls into his clutches 
he torments her in the unkindest manner while I suck him with 
might and main. The while Saint-Fond carries on with his deflower- 
ing, and having put the second girl in the same state as the first and 
turned her over to the Prince, he grabs the fourteen-year-old. 

“You have no idez. how much I enjoy fucking in darkness this 
way,” says he; “the shz.des of night are a goad to crime and enor- 
mously facilitate committing it satisfactorily.” 

Saint-Fond, who had got this far without discharging, now let 
fly into the eldest girl’s ass; and then he and the Prince held parley. 
It was agreed between them that Saint-Fond should retain for him- 
self her who had just drained out his sperm; in exchange, he ceded 
the two other girls to the Prince, and that worthy,-armed with all 
the equipment necessary for the tortures he was contemplating, 
staggered off in an ecstasy, leading his victims by their chains; while 
I accompanied my lover and the one who was to die by his hand. 
When we were gone off a distance, I told him of my theft, we both 
laughed heartily, and te assured me that, as was his custom, the 
Prince, prior to coming to our party, had visited a brothel with 
a view to putting himself in the appropriate mood; and that nothing 
would be easier than to convince him his treasures had been stolen 
there. 

“You are a friend of this man, I suppose ?” 

“I am friend to no one,” the Minister gave me answer; “my 
connections with this original have been advantageous so far, he 
is on the best of terms with the King; but when that changes, let 
him fall into disgrace tomorrow, and I’ll be the first to tread upon 
him. He divined my tastes, I don’t know how; he gave me to 
understand his were similar, he proposed we collaborate, I ac- 
quiesced—that’s the extent of our relationship. What is it, Juliette, 
do you dislike the fellow?” 


Juliette & 245

“T find him unbearable.” 

“Upon my soul, were it not for the political considerations 
I’ve just mentioned, I'd be only too happy to see him in your power. 
Nevertheless we can perhaps arrange his downfall. For, my dear, 
you please me to such a degree, there is nothing I am not willing 
to do for you.” 

“You were saying, were you not, that you have obligations 
toward him?” 

“T havea few.” 

“Well then, how, in the light of your principles, how can you 
for one instant tolerate being in.his debt ?” 

‘Leave everything to me, Juliette.” And then Saint-Fond, 
changing the subject, praised me anew for the manner in which I 
had conducted this feast. ‘‘You are,” said he, ‘‘a woman of taste 
and wit and the better I come to know you, the more I am per- 
suaded that I must attach you to me.” 

And then for the first time he addressed me in the familiar tu, 
and he granted me the yet greater favor of employing that term 
with him. 

“I shall serve’ you my whole life long if such be your wish, 
Saint-Fond,” I replied; “I know your tastes, I shall satisfy them 
and if you desire to bind me more closely to you, you will concur 
in the satisfying of mine.” 

“Kiss me, heavenly creature, one hundred thousand crowns 
shall be delivered to you tomorrow morning—see if I do not guess 
your heart’s desires!” 

It was at that point an old beggarwoman accosted us, asking 
for alms. 

‘‘What’s this!’ cried Saint-Fond, surprised. “Do they let the 
rabble in?” The Minister gazed inquiringly at me; he detected the 
smile upon my lips and grasped the jest at once. 

“Delicious, delicious,” he murmured. ‘‘Eh then, what is it you 
wish ?”’ he went on, turning to the crone. 

‘Alas, my Lord, a few pennies out of charity,” replied she; 
“come, deign to look upon my misery.” 

And catching the Minister by the hand, she guided him into a 
mean little hut lit by a lamp hung from the ceiling, and where two 


246 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


children, one male and the other female, and no older than eight or 
ten, were lying naked on some rotten straw. 

“Behold this unhappy family,” the pauper said to us; “it’s 
been three days since I was able to give them a crust of bread. Have 
the kindness, you who are reputed so very rich, to give me the 
wherewithal to sustain my children awhile in their sorry existence. 
Oh, my Lord, I know not who you are; but are you acquainted with 
Monsieur de Saint-Fond?” 

“T am,” said the Minister. 

‘Ah then! you see his handiwork before you. He had my hus- 
band taken off to jail; he deprived us of the little that we possessed 
of goods; such are the cruel circumstances we are reduced to since 
above a year... .” 

The great thing «about this scene, my friends, the thing in 
which I could take pricie, was its complete authenticity: I had un- 
earthed these wretched victims of Saint-Fond’s injustice and 
rapacity, I now. presenzed them to him in the flesh, to reawaken 
his wickedness. 

“Ah, the scoundrel!” exclaimed the Minister, staring fixedly 
at the humble woman, “‘yes, I know him well, by God I do, and you 
shall come to know him too: he stands before you. . . . Oh, 
Juliette, ’tis cleverly you have prepared this confrontation, my 
soul is in a very fermert. . . . How then, what is your complaint? 
I’ve sent your husband to prison, he is innocent—that is true. I’ve 
done better yet: your husband is no more. Until now, you have 
eluded me; for I meant to treat you likewise.” 

“What wrong hav2 we done you, my Lord?” 

“That of dwelling in my neighborhood, and of owning a small 
property you were not disposed to sell to me. But it is mine now, 
ruining you I have dispossessed you. And now you come begging 
to me. Do you think I care if you die of starvation?” 

‘But these poor children?” 

“France contains about ten million too many of them: weed- 
ing the garden is to render society a service.” Peering down at the 
children, he rolled first the one, then the other over with his foot. 
“Not bad stuff, though. It needn’t go entirely to waste.” 

Whereupon, his prick prodigiously stiffened by all the fore- 
going, the wag bends, seizes the little boy, and embuggers him on 


Juliette & 247 


the spot; next catching hold of the little girl, he does the same 
with her. Then, very heatedly he cries: ‘Lousy old bitch, show 
me your bewrinkled bum, I require the sight of your flapping but- 
tocks in order to unload.” 

The old woman weeps, she resists; I lend Saint-Fond my aid. 
Having heaped insults upon that woebegone ass, the libertine pene- 
trates it, while trampling on the brats, literally crushing them be- 
neath his boots as he sodomizes their mother, and at the moment 
of his discharge he fires a bullet into her brain. And we depart 
from that den of misfortune, dragging along the fourteen-year-old 
victim, whose buttocks Saint-Fond had been kissing the whole time 
he was in action. 

“Well, Sire,” I said as we were strolling away, ‘from now on 
that family’s property is yours to do with as you like; that was 
not the case until this evening. Those people had solicited help, 
their pleas had obtained a hearing, trouble was brewing; not, to be 
sure, that they could have caused you any serious worries; but they 
would have proved a nuisance. I found them out at work, I lured 
them here; now you're rid of them.” 

Saint-Fond was in a state of inconceivable exaltation. ‘Ah, 
how sweet is crime,” said he, the sincerest feeling manifest in his 
tone, “and how voluptuous its aftermaths! Juliette, you cannot 
imagine how my every fiber has been electrified by the deed you 
have just led me to commit... . My angel, my divine creature, my 
one god, only say: what is it you would have me do for you?” 

“You are pleased, I know, when one gives voice to one’s long- 
ing for money—will you then increase the promised sum?” 

“It was a hundred thousand crowns, I believe ?” 

“Ves,” 

“You'll have twice that amount, Oh, Juliette. But wait, what 
is this?” cried the Minister, recoiling at the sight of two masked 
men who were approaching us, pistols in their hands. “I shudder; 
I am not one of your courageous fools. . .. Ho there, gentlemen! 
What do you want?” 

‘You'll soon see,” replies one of the two, binding Saint-Fond 
fast to a tree and pulling his breeches down to his heels. 

“But what do you intend to do?” 

“To give you a lesson,” said the other man; he is brandishing 


’ 


248 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


a cat-o’-nine-tails, and already swinging it at the ministerial be- 
hind, “‘to teach you to deal as you have just done with those poor 
folk in the cottage.” 

And after he has leid on three or four hundred strokes, which 
serve mainly to bring Saint-Fond’s wearied tool into the air again, 
the other hoves up and completes his ecstasy by introducing a gi- 
gantean prick into his anus. Having fucked, the fucker takes up the 
whip in his turn and whips; when he is done whipping, his com- 
panion bum-tups my lover—who, throughout, palpates the young 
girl’s buttocks to the right and mine to the left; Saint-Fond is un- 
tied, the two men vanish into the night, and we wander off again 
down obscure lanes. 

“Oh, Juliette, I must say it to you ever and ever again, you are 
divine. . . . But, you know, that last episode gave me a fright— 
there’s nothing like subjecting one’s nerves to an initial commotion 
before imparting that of voluptuousness to them: the average man 
will always remain in tctal ignorance of such contrasts and grada- 
tions.” 

‘Fear acts powerfully upon you ?” 

‘‘Prodigiously, my dear. I’m probably the greatest coward on 
earth, the which I own without the least twinge of shame. Being 
afraid is an art, it is a science, the art and science of self-preserva- 
tion, and of capital importance to man; so that it is a patent ab- 
surdity to link honor to bravery in the face of dangers. I place my 
honor rather in dreadiny them all.” 

“Ah, Saint-Fond, :f fear can have such an effect upon your 
senses, think what must be its effect upon those who are the victims 
of your passions !”” 

“Exactly, and it is thence comes my keenest pleasure,” the 
Minister rejoined; “the very essence of my enjoyment is in making 
those victims so suffer .n the selfsame way from the thing which 
plagues my existence. . .. But where are we? this garden of yours, 
Juliette, is vast indeed.” 

‘“We are at the edge of one of the pits prepared for the 
victims.” 

‘Ah yes,” said Saint-Fond, stooping and reaching out a hand, 
“the Prince must have performed a sacrifice hereabouts, I do be- 
lieve I feel a corpse.” 


Juliette 249 


“Let’s pull it out,” I suggested, “and see who it is. . . . She 
seems to be the youngest of the three sisters—and not quite dead 
either. I dare say the rascal throttled her, then buried her alive. 
Well, we'll revive her, and you'll have the fun of slaying two.” 

Our attentions did indeed bring the poor child back to life, but 
she was unable to tell us what the Prince had done to her once she 
had lost consciousness. The two sisters hugged each other, shedding 
many tears; and the barbarous Saint-Fond informed them that he 
was about to kill them both. Which is what he went ahead and did; 
however, since I have a good many adventures of this kind to relate, 
rather than risk being tedious, I shall forego a description of this 
one. Suffice it to say that the monster discharged into the ass of the 
younger of the two creatures while finishing her off; we tossed some 
dirt into the pit; and we pursued our way. 

“Innumerable are the fell deeds which may afford pleasure; but 
to my knowledge there is none that causes it more deliciously than 
destruction, wanton murder,” that arch-libertine affirmed. “No, 
there is no ecstasy to compare with the one you taste as you indulge 
in this divine infamy: were this amusement to become more gen- 
erally widespread, I can assure you the earth would be depopulated 
inside a dozen years. Dear Juliette, your performance of a moment 
ago encourages me to suppose that you are as fond of crime as I.” 

And I gave Saint-Fond plainly to understand that it stimulated 
me not one whit less, and if anything, more, than it did him. It was 
then we perceived, in a clearing among the trees, and by the light 
of the moon, what appeared to be a little convent. 

‘‘And now what have we here ?”’ asked Saint-Fond. ‘‘Does she 
mean to drown me in delight ?” 

“Truth to tell,” said I, “I do not know where we are.” I 
knocked on the door. 

It was opened by a nun advanced in years. 

“Venerable and beloved mother,” I said to her, “will you show 
your hospitality to two strangers who have wandered off the beaten 
path?” 

“Enter,” the good lady replied; “though this be a nunnery, the 
virtue you invoke is not alien to our hearts, and we shall as willingly 
practice it with you as we have done with an elderly seigneur who 


250 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


a short while ago made the same request: he is with the women of 
the house who have just risen for matins.” 

From what she told us, we realized that the Prince was there 
too. We joined him; he was surrounded by a group made up of 
another nun and half a dozen pensionnaires aged from twelve to 
sixteen. Yet covered with the blood of his latest victim, the old 
lecher was already beginning to behave disrespectfully. 

Quickly we entered the room, the nun who was there addressed 
herself to Saint-Fond. 

“Monsieur, will you put a halt to this ungrateful person’s 
effrontery. In return for the kindness we have shown him he has 
done nought but insult us.” 

“Madame,” replied! the Minister, ‘‘my friend, scarcely more 
moral than I and like myself detesting virtue, is very little disposed 
to reward it; your pensionnaires look exceedingly attractive to me; 
either we set your damned convent afire this instant, or by God, we 
rape the six of them.” 

Thereupon, with one hand seizing the smallest, and with his 
fist lashing out at two nuns who seek to protect her, Saint-Fond 
violates her there and then, frontwardly. Need more be said? The 
five others had soon undergone the same fate, except that Saint- 
Fond, fearing lest his tool weaken, ignored cunts and perforated 
assholes only. As one by one they emerged from his clutches, the 
Prince took charge of them and flogged them till they bled, syn- 
chronizing that ceremony with the other of kissing my buttocks 
which, he oft repeated, he prized, he cherished, he adored. Saint- 
Fond, keeping a firm gri> upon himself, had discharged not a drop; 
he has at the two nuns, one of whom is over sixty, shuts himself up 
with them in an adjoining cell, and comes back thirty minutes later, 
alone. 

“Eh, my friend, what have you done with those duennas?”’ I 
inquire of the Minister, who rejoins us in a very overwrought state. 

“Remaining in con:rol of this establishment,” he informs us, 
“meant getting rid of those warders: I started by sporting with 
them in that cell, I have a passion for weatherbeaten asses. Then, 
discovering a stairway that leads down to a well, I cast them in.” 

“And these pullets, what’s to be done with them? I trust we 
aren’t going to leave them alive,” says the Prince. 


Juliette & 251 


Further horrors were perpetrated, whereof I'll say only that 
they were ghastly; the convent was emptied. 

The two libertines, having by now emptied their balls also, 
and seeing day about to break, desired to return to my house. There, 
a sumptuous breakfast, served by three naked women, was awaiting 
us; we all had hearty appetites. The Prince asked Saint-Fond’s leave 
to spend a few hours in bed with me; and my lover, flanked by two 
manservants, had himself fucked until the sun was well up in 
the sky. 

The old nobleman’s struggles and wigglings constituted no 
great threat to my modesty; after going to great pains and lengths 
he contrived to introduce himself into my asshole, though ’twas not 
for long he stuck there; Nature dashed my hopes, the instrument 
bent, and the villain, who hadn’t even the strength to discharge— 
for he had, he maintained, shed his fuck twice in the course of the 
evening—fell asleep, his snout wedged in my behind. 

As soon as we rose, Saint-Fond, more enchanted with me than 
ever, gave me a draft for eight hundred thousand francs, payable 
at the Royal Treasury; and he and his friend quitted my house. 

Generally speaking, all the succeeding parties resembled that 
inaugural one, save for particular episodes I with my fertile imagi- 
nation took care to vary constantly. Noirceuil was almost always 
present, but apart from the Prince I had not seen any strangers 
at any of them. 

I had been at the helm of that great vessel for three months, 
steering it with all possible success, when Saint-Fond informed me 
I had a ministerial crime to commit on the morrow. Oh, dread 
consequences of a barbarous policy! The victim? Surely, my friends, 
you would be hard pressed to guess his identity. "Twas Saint-Fond’s 
own father, a gentleman of sixty-six, in every way the soul of 
respectability; he had been disturbed at his son’s irregularities of 
comportment, dreading lest they prove his undoing; he had argued 
with him, warned him, even spoken to his disadvantage at Court, 
with the aim of constraining him to leave the Ministry, very rightly 
believing that it were better for this scoundrel his son to retire of 
his own accord, rather than be banished from the stage. 

From the outset, Saint-Fond took his interference ill; he stood 
to gain a yearly three thousand from his father’s death and accord- 


252 de» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ingly did not long delay coming to a decision. Noirceuil arrived 
with the particulars; and noticing that I appeared somewhat to 
waver at the prospect of this major crime, he thought by means of 
the following speech to cleanse the projected deed of the taints of 
atrocity my weakness idiotically ascribed to it. 

“The evil you fancy you do in killing a man, and the further 
evil you imagine exists where the question is of parricide—these, it 
seems to me, my dear, are the two notions I ought to endeavor to 
combat. However, I nezd waste no time examining the former of 
the two; a mind such as yours can only scorn the prejudices that 
hold criminal the destruction of one’s fellow beings.* This homicide 
is a simple affair for you, since between your existence and the 
victim’s no tie exists; it only becomes complicated for my friend; 
you are awed by the stain of parricide he is only too willing to incur, 
and therefore it shall be from this viewpoint alone I'll consider the 
deed. 

“Parricide: is it or is it not a crime? 

“‘Assuredly, if there is in all the world a single deed I esteem 
justified, legitimate, it is this one; and, pray tell me, what relation- 
ship can there be between myself and him who brought me into the 
world ? How would you have me think myself in any way beholden 
to a man, merely because, once upon a time, some whimsy moved 
him to discharge into my mother’s cunt? Nothing is more prepos- 
terous than this piece of foolishness; but what now if I am un- 
acquainted with him, what if I do not know the identity of this 
individual, this father of mine who sired me? Does the voice of 
Nature perhaps speak up in me and tell me who he is? Never. So 
should I not be as distant in my attitude toward him as toward 
anybody else? If this fact is sure, and thereof I do not believe any 
doubt can subsist, parricide in no wise increases the supposed evil 
in homicide, one does ro worse murdering one’s own father than 
murdering some other person. If I kill the man who, unbeknownst 
to me, begot me, the fact that he is my father contributes nothing 
to my remorse; hence, it is merely because I am told we are kin 
that I pause or repent; well, I ask you, how can opinion worsen a 
crime ? and can opinion possibly alter its nature? What! I am free 


3 This system will be amply developed further. 


Juliette <b» 253 


to slay my father and feel no remorse provided I am not aware he 
is my father, but cannot in that other case where I know him to 
be? See the implications of such reasoning: even if it be an arrant 
lie, others have but to convince me it is the truth, that the man I 
have just slain was my father, and lo! I am to be filled with regrets 
and dread discomfort—’tis sheer nonsense. 

‘And further: if remorse exists, though grounds therefor do 
not, that remorse cannot properly exist when the alleged grounds 
for it are present. If you can so very easily deceive me in all this, 
then I tell you, the crime you speak of is no crime at all, it is 
illusory ; since Nature herself does not give me certain indication of 
who the author of my days is, ’tis surely because she would not have 
me feel any greater tenderness for him than for some other person 
who is of no particular concern to me; if your opinion alone creates 
occasion and cause for remorse, and if your opinion can deceive 
me, then this remorse is a paltry business, insignificant, null; and I 
am a fool if I consent to succumb to it. Do animals cleave worship- 
fully to their fathers? Have they even a bare inkling of which male 
begot them ? Searching for motives to warrant filial gratitude, will 
you cite the care my father took of me during my infancy and child- 
hood? Another error. Complying with them, he ceded to the cus- 
toms of the country, to his pride, to a sentiment which, as a father, 
he managed to conceive for his handiwork but which there is no 
need whatever that I conceive for the artisan; for that artisan, 
acting uniquely at the behest of his own pleasure, had no thought at 
all for me when it so pleased him to proceed to the act of propaga- 
tion with my dam; his sole concern was for himself, and I fail to 
see therein any basis for especially ardent feelings of gratitude. 

“Ah! let us entertain no more illusions on this article, the 
prejudice is unworthy of mature minds: to the person who gave us 
life we owe no more than we do to the remotest, chilliest stranger. 
In us Nature prompts absolutely no feeling for him, none; I shall 
go farther: she could not possibly imbue us with any feeling for 
him, friendship is not something that can be imposed upon us from 
outside; it is false that one loves one’s father, it is equally false, 
indeed, that we can love him: you fear him, yes, but love him you 
do not; usually a threat to you, always onerous, his existence can- 
not but disquiet and inconvenience you; personal interest, the most 


254 Qs THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


sacred of the laws of Nature, puts us under invincible compulsion 
to desire the death of the man from whom we await our inheritance; 
and the problem envisaged from this angle, not only would we hate 
that man as a matter of course, but, very probably, it would be 
even more natural still to attempt his life, for the excellent reason 
that everybody deserves to have his turn, and that if my father has 
for two score years en oyed the fortune come down to him from 
his father, and that if I find myself growing old in everlasting 
expectancy of the substance whereupon my welfare dances attend- 
ance, I should definitely, and without a trace of remorse, aid a 
Nature that is sometimes behindhand or remiss, and myself, em- 
ploying whatever means, accelerate the process whereby I enter into 
the exercise of rights Nature accords me but may well delay trans- 
mitting to me, out of some caprice neither I nor anyone else in his 
senses will refrain from taking steps to counteract. If self-interest is 
the general rule by which man measures all his actions, there is, 
necessarily, much less evil in killing one’s father than in killing some 
other human being; for our personal reasons for ridding ourselves 
of him who brought us into the light must always be stronger and 
more valid than those we have for putting any other person out of 
the way. Here also there exists another metaphysical consideration 
we ought not lose sight of : old age is the road to death; causing a 
man to age, Nature speeds him toward his grave: he, therefore, 
who slays an oldster does nought but carry out her intentions: 
whence it is, that among many nations, murder of the aged is 
accounted a virtue. Useless to the world, so much excess baggage in 
society, consuming provender that is scarce already, that is lacking 
to the young or which the young must buy dearly because of the 
overgreat demand, their existence is demonstrably to no purpose, it 
is harmful, and the wisest course is to liquidate them, that is self- 
evident. Hence, not only is it no crime at all, to kill one’s father, it 
is an excellent thing to do; it is a meritorious deed from the point 
of view of oneself, whom it serves; having regard now to Nature, 
it is also meritorious, for it is to free her of an unwelcome burden; 
and it is praiseworthy, since it supposes that a man be vigorous 
enough, philosophical enough to value himself, who may be of 
some use to humanity, above that dotard humanity has all but 
forgotten. 


Juliette we 255 


‘And so, Juliette, you are about to perform a handsome deed 
in destroying the enemy of your lover who, I am sure, serves the 
State to the utmost of his ability; for if, as I would be the last to 
deny, he is now and again guilty of some petty prevarication, some 
petty peculation, Saint-Fond is a very great minister nonetheless: 
he is bloodthirsty, he is rapacious, fierce is his grip, he considers 
murder indispensable to the maintaining of good government. Is he 
mistaken? Sulla, Marius, Richelieu, Mazarin—all history’s great 
statesmen, have they thought otherwise? Did Machiavelli lay 
down different principles? There is no room for doubt: bloodshed 
there must be if any regime, a monarchical one especially, is to 
survive; the throne of the tyrant must be cemented with blood, and 
Saint-Fond has yet to begin to spill anything like the quantity of it 
that should be flowing this very minute. . . . Finally, Juliette, per- 
form this gesture and you remain in the good graces of a man who 
keeps you in what I believe may be accurately termed a state of 
prosperity; you increase the fortune of him who is responsible for 
yours: I really wonder that you even hesitate.” 

“‘Noirceuil,” said I very pertly, ‘“‘who told you I was hesitat- 
ing? "T'was merely some involuntary reflex in me, no more. I am 
young yet. I am but a fledgling, my career has only just begun; that 
I stumble a little, backslide now and then—should this surprise my 
mentors? But they’ll soon see I am worthy of the pains they take 
with me. Let Saint-Fond make haste and send his father to me, he’s 
a dead man two hours after he crosses the threshold of my house. 
However, my dear, there are three categories of poison in the 
assortment your friend entrusted to me; do you know which I am 
to employ ?” 

“The cruelest, the one that causes the greatest suffering,” 
answered Noirceuil; “I am glad you reminded me. Saint-Fond was 
adamant on that score. He wishes that, in going to his death, his 
father be punished for having intrigued to his detriment, he wishes 
his agony to be hideous.” 

“T understand,” I said, ‘“‘and you may tell him that the thing 
shall be handled to his satisfaction. But what is the plan?” 

“As follows,” Noirceuil replied. ‘As the friend of the Minis- 
ter, you will invite the old man to dinner; that is, you will send him 
a note, in it you will make it clear that your design is to bring 


256 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


about a conciliation: you yourself sharing his views regarding his 
son’s retirement from public office, you'd like to discuss the matter 
with Saint-Fond senior. He will come; ill, he will be borne out of 
your house; Saint-Fond junior will attend to the rest. Here’s the 
sum agreed upon for te execution of the crime: a draft for one. 
hundred thousand crowns on the Treasury. Will that suffice, 
Juliette?” 

“Saint-Fond gives me that much for a supper,” said I, handing 
back the scrap of paper; “‘tell him I'll do this for nothing. I simply 
wish to be helpful.” 

“And here is another draft for the same amount,” Noirceuil 
went on; “your lover anticipated your objection—indeed, he would 
have been disappointed had you made none. ‘I want her to be paid, 
and paid according to her desires-—often has he repeated that to 
me. ‘So long as she evirces selfishness, and so long as I satisfy that 
selfishness, I am sure nct to lose her.’ ”’ 

“Saint-Fond seems. to know me very well,” was my reply; “I 
have a liking for money, I don’t hide the fact from myself, neither 
do I from you. But I shall never ask him for more than is necessary. 
These six hundred thoisand francs will go into carrying out the 
project; I want six hundred thousand more for myself the day the 
old man expires.” 

“You'll have them, never fear. Oh, Juliette, what a splendid 
situation is yours! Do nothing to spoil it, do everything to deserve 
it, enjoy it, and if you know how to conduct yourself intelligently, 
you'll soon be the wealthiest woman in Europe; I have given you a 
marvelous friend.” 

“Out of respect for your principles, Noirceuil, I refrain from 
thanking you; arranging this liaison pleased you, you gain there- 
from as well, it flatters you to have among your intimate acquaint- 
ances a woman whose social position, riches, and name have already 
started to eclipse those of the Court princesses. . . . I'd be ashamed 
to show myself at the Opera dressed as the Princesse de Nemours 
was yesterday evening; not a soul so much as glanced at her. Every- 
body’s eyes were upon me.” 

“And you are relishing all this, Juliette?” 

“Infinitely, my dear. To begin with, I am rolling in gold, 
which, for me, is the foremost of enjoyable things.” 


Juliette 2 257 


“But are you doing sufficient fucking?” 

‘‘A great deal; precious few are the nights when the best Paris 
can boast in the one and the other sex does not come to offer me 
the greatest homage.” 

‘And your favorite crimes?” 

‘They are being committed, they are being committed. I steal 
every chance I get—I don’t let an odd franc get by. You’d think, 
from my graspingness, from my thievery, I was in imminent danger 
of starving to death.” 

‘And vengeance ?”” 

“I have been particularly active on that score: the fearful 
unpleasantness that has befallen Prince de X.—you’ve heard the 
news? the whole town is talking about nothing else—’twas I alone 
arranged that. Five or six ladies who in the past few months have 
thought to challenge my social position are presently lodged in the 
Bastille.” 

Next, we entered into a few details touching the parties I gave 
for the Minister. 

“I must tell you,” said Noirceuil, “that of late there are 
signs you are relaxing your efforts, Saint-Fond has noticed it. There 
were fewer than fifty dishes at the last supper; you are of course 
aware that only by eating well can one hope to discharge copiously,” 
he continued, ‘‘and for us libertines, the quality and the quantity of 
our sperm is of crucial importance. Gluttony fares wonderfully well 
with all the tastes it has pleased Nature to instill in us; and experi- 
ence shows that the prick is never so rigid, the heart never so 
staunch, as after one has sumptuously dined. I would say a word, 
too, about the choice of girls. Although those you place before us 
are without doubt very pretty, Saint-Fond feels that more research 
would improve the selection. I cannot but attempt to impress upon 
you the care that must be taken in this matter. We require that the 
game furnished us not only be of the finest breed, but that in 
addition it possess all those qualities, moral as well as physical, 
which make bagging it interesting.” 

For answer to this, I outlined the excellent measures I was 
taking : instead of six, now I had two dozen women working around 
the clock, and under them they had an equal number of subalterns 


258 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


combing the provinces; I was the mainspring of the entire mecha- 
nism; and I was putting forward a great effort. 

‘Before contracting for an object,” Noirceuil recommended, 
“even if it involve a thirty-league journey, make it: there is no 
substitute for personal inspection; and never accept anything but 
what meets with your total approval.” 

‘All very well,” said I, ‘‘but that formula is not always so easy 
to follow. The object is frequently kidnapped before I have had a 
description of it.” 

‘““Why then,” Noirceuil rejoined, “kidnap twenty to obtain a 
yield of five.” 

“But what am I to do with the rejects?” 

‘‘Whatever you wish: sport with them yourself, sell them to 
your friends, to procuresses, to panders. With the apparatus you 
will have built up you should be able to traffic on a broad scale and, 
it would seem to me, even create a virtual monopoly; at any rate, 
there ought to be a good hundred thousand a year in this for you.” 

“True, if Saint-Fond paid me for every object acquired. As 
things stand, he only remits for three per supper.” 

“I think I can induce him to pay for the lot.” 

‘““He’ll be far better served if he does. Now, Noirceuil,” I 
said, ‘there are some cther matters I should like to discuss, and 
they relate to me. You know the kind of mind I have: I need hardly 
tell you that with all these means for mischief-making, I indulge 
very heavily in it; the ideas which occur to me, the things I imagine 
are beyond description—but, my friend, I require your advice. 
Don’t you suppose that, ultimately, my behavior may make Saint- 
Fond jealous ?” 

“Never,’’ Noirceul answered at once. ‘‘Saint-Fond is an ex- 
ceedingly reasonable person, as such he senses you cannot attain 
self-expression save through much wrongdoing; the idea itself 
amuses him, and only yesterday he was telling me that he was 
afraid you were not enough of a trollop.” 

‘Oh, in that case, let him be easy; you may assure the Minister 
that it is seldom one firds a person with a more pronounced taste 
for every sort of vice.” 

“T have now and then heard it asked,” said Noirceuil, 
“whether the jealousy she inspires speaks in favor of or against a

woman, and I have always thought the question odd: for my part 
it has from the beginning been obvious to me that the impulse 
leading to this mania being purely personal, women assuredly have 
nothing to gain from the tumult it produces in their lovers’ breasts. 
It is not by any means fondness for a woman that brings on jeal- 
ousy; it is dread of the humiliation her change of heart would 
cause one; and to prove there is nothing but sheer egoism in and 
behind this passion, I have simply to remind you that no lover, if 
he be of good faith, and sincere, will deny he would prefer to see 
his mistress dead than unfaithful. Hence, it is rather her fickleness 
than the loss of her that afflicts us, and ’tis hence our own selves we 
are thinking of when the event takes place. Whence I conclude that, 
second only to the inexcusable folly of falling in love with a woman 
in the first place, the greatest extravagance a man can commit is to 
be jealous of her. With regard to her, this sentiment is dishonest, 
demonstrating, as it does, one’s lack of esteem for her; with regard 
to oneself, it is regularly painful and inevitably useless, since the 
surest way to breed in a woman the wish to fail us is to intimate 
to her our fear lest she do so. Jealousy and the terror of cuckoldry 
are two things based entirely upon our prejudices pertaining to the 
enjoyment of women; were it not for this accursed habit of stub- 
bornly and idiotically wanting, whenever it is a question of woman, 
to associate the moral and the physical, we'd long ago have had 
done with these vile notions. What? It is not possible, you say, to lie 
with a woman without loving her? And it is not possible to love 
her without lying with her? But why must you embroil the heart 
in something where it is exclusively the body that acts? They are 
two desires, they are two very different needs, so it seems to me. 
Araminthe has the world’s most beautiful figure, her face is endear- 
ing, her big brown sultry eyes promise an ample ejaculation of her 
sperm once the walls of her vagina or the interior of her anus are 
electrified by friction from the rubbing of my prick: I poke her and 
sure enough, behold! I was right, she squirts a quart. Why, pray 
tell, need anything heartfelt accompany the act whereby I take this 
creature’s body? It does appear to me once again, that loving and 
enjoying are distinct and separate affairs, and that not only is it 
unnecessary to love in order to enjoy, but that it suffices to enjoy in 
order not to love. For dreamy, tender sentiments rise out of com- 


260 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


patibility of humor and expediency, but are in no wise due to the 
beauty of a bust or the pretty contours of a bum; and I would not 
allow these latter objects, which depending upon our peculiarities 
of taste can sharply excite the physical affections, to be able to 
exert a similar prise upon the moral affections. To complete my 
comparison: Belinda is ugly, she’s forty-two, not one hint of the 
gracious anywhere about her person, not a single attractive feature, 
no, she’s a slug, grossly ill-favored. But Belinda is clever, she has 
wit, a delicious character, a million things which mate nicely with 
my sentiments and tastes; I’d have no desire to bed with Belinda, 
but I’d be wild about fer conversation nonetheless. I’d intensely 
desire to have Araminthe, but I’d cordially detest her the moment 
the fever of desire had abated, because in her I have found a body 
only, and none of the moral qualities which could win her a place in 
my heart. All this however is quite irrelevant to the present case; 
in Saint-Fond’s tolerant attitude toward the infidelities you commit 
there is an element of “ibertine sentiment for which none of the 
foregoing provides an alequate explanation. The idea of you lying 
in another’s arms entrarices Saint-Fond, he himself puts you there, 
knowing you there, imayining you there, seeing you there hardens 
his prick; you'll multiply his pleasures as proportionally you aug- 
ment the size and number of your own, and Saint-Fond will never 
cherish you so much as when you do to the utmost that which would 
earn you the hatred of a clod. Here it is a question of one of those 
mental anomalies comprehensible, and indeed common, only to 
cerebral individuals like ourselves, but which are not on account of 
their rarity any the less clelectable.” 

‘‘What you tell mz is reassuring,” said I; ‘“Saint-Fond will 
love my tastes, my mind, my character, and shan’t be at all jealous 
of my person? Very grzat is my relief to hear you say it, for, I 
confess to you, continence would be impossible for me, my tempera- 
ment requires satisfaction, my thirst requires to be slaked at all 
costs; hot-blooded as I am, energetic and imaginative as you know 
me to be, with this colossal wealth at my command, how ever could 
I resist passions aroused by everything, inflamed continually?” 

“Surrender to them, Juliette, surrender to them, you cannot 
do more, you should not do less; but in your dealings with the 
public at large, I would urge you to be somewhat the hypocrite. 


Juliette & 261 


Remember that in this world hypocrisy is an indispensable vice for 
him who has the fortune of possessing all the others; with art and 
deceit, one succeeds at anything, for it isn’t your virtue society 
needs, it is simply a pretext for supposing you virtuous. For every 
two occasions when this virtue will be necessary to you, there will 
be thirty others when you'll only have to simulate it; therefore don 
the mask, debauched women, study to perfect the appearance ex- 
pected of you, but only to the point of indifference to crime, never 
so far as enthusiasm for virtue, because the former attitude leaves 
the amour-propre of others in peace whilst the latter exasperates 
it. Moreover, it is quite enough to hide what one loves without 
having to feign what one detests. If all men were vicious in better 
faith, there’d be no need for hypocrisy; but, falsely persuaded that 
from virtue there are advantages to be reaped, they must absolutely 
cling to some shred or vestige of it. One must do as they, and, to 
secure their good opinion, conceal all one can of one’s misconduct 
under the cloak of that worm-eaten and ridiculous idol; quits, of 
course, to revenge oneself for this enforced homage by making that 
many the more sacrifices to its rival. In addition, hypocrisy, teach- 
ing one craft and guile, facilitates countless crimes; your disinter- 
ested air invites trust, the adversary lowers his guard, and the less 
you give him to suspect you are armed with one, the easier it is to 
drive home the dagger. This covert and mysterious manner of thus 
satisfying the passions increases a thousandfold the enjoyment you 
derive from them. Cynicism has its piquancy, I am aware of it, but 
it does not lure into your net, it does not assure you victims as 
certainly as hypocrisy does; and then too, effrontery, all that comes 
under the head of the criminally crapulous, is not truly to be 
savored except in debaucheries. These the hypocrite, secure within 
the four walls of his house and his solid reputation, may perfectly 
well indulge in once he has answered the requirements of his 
libertinage—surely; who’s to stop him? But it will be generally 
agreed that elsewhere than in the sanctuary of the home cynicism is 
out of place, it is bad form, in poor taste, and by creating a breach 
between society and yourself, it incapacitates you for the enjoyment 
of all society has to offer. The crimes of debauchery are not the 
only ones that afford delight, you understand, there are quantities 
of others, of the highest interest and often very lucrative, which 


262 + THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


hypocrisy makes available to us, but cynicism unattainable. Was 
there ever a falser, adroiter, more unscrupulous wench than Ma- 
dame Brinvilliers, that pillar of society in her day? It was in the 
charity hospitals she used to make trial of her poisons, it was 
behind the shield of piety and the screen of philanthropy she would 
experiment with the delicious means to her crimes. Her father said 
to her, as he lay upon his deathbed where he had been brought by a 
poisoned drink administered by her, ‘Oh, my beloved daughter, my 
one regret in taking leave: of life is that I shall no longer be able to 
do for you all the things I would like.’ 

“And the daughter’ response was a supplementary dose in the 
cup of tea she handed to the sinking patient. The world boasted 
no more artful, more subtle creature; she played at devotion, she 
was ever at Mass, she distributed a fortune in alms, and did all that 
to cover her crimes; and so it was a long time before she was found 
out, and perhaps she never would have been but for the incaution 
and misfortune of her lover.> Let that woman serve as an example 
to you, my dear, I couldn’t propose a better.” 

“I know the whole story of that famous creature by heart,” I 
replied, “and you may be sure I aspire to follow in her footsteps. 
But, kind friend, I’d like to have a more contemporary model; I’d 
wish her to be somewhat older than me, I’d want her to love me, to 
have tastes like mine, passions like mine, and, though we’d mastur- 
bate together, I’d want her to allow me all my other follies without 
being in the slightest bit jealous; be that as it may, I’d want her to 
have a certain ascendancy over me, but that without seeking to 
dominate me; I’d want her to give me sound advice, to cooperate at 
all times in my caprices, to be profoundly experienced in libertinage; 
to be irreligious as well as unprincipled, as much a stranger to good

5 We know that Sainte-Crnix, Madame Brinvilliers’ lover, perished while con- 
cocting a powerful poison (we give the recipe below). He had put on a glass face- 
protector to keep from inhaling the effluvia of the brew: so active was the venom, 
it shattered the mask, and the chemist was undone. As soon as she heard of Sainte- 
Croix’ misadventure, Brinvilliers unwisely rushed to his house and ordered the 
servants to turn over to her the casket in which her lover stored his other preparations 
—that was her fatal error. Laver, this casket was conveyed to the Bastille, and its 
contents were made extensive use of by all the members of the family of Louis XV. 

This celebrated woman was also convicted of having poisoned her two brothers 
and her sister and was subsequeatly beheaded, in the year 1679.

manners as to virtue, to have great warmth of wit and a heart of 
ice.” 

“I have just what you are looking for,” Noirceuil replied; ‘“‘a 
widow of thirty, lovely, nay, beautiful, criminal to the core, arrayed 
with all the qualities you list, and who will be of invaluable aid to 
you in your chosen career. She can replace me as your tutor; for, 
you realize, separated as we are, I can no longer attend to your 
needs with the same ardor as before: Madame de Clairwil, that is 
the name of the person I have in mind, and she is a millionaire, 
knows everybody worth knowing, everything that can possibly be 
known, and I am convinced she will agree to take you under her 
wing.” 

“Charming Noirceuil, you are too good; but there’s yet more 
to it, my friend, I’d like to share my knowledge with another; I 
keenly sense my need of instruction, I no less keenly desire to 
educate someone: I must have a teacher, yes, and I must have a 
pupil too.” 

“Of course. My fiancée?” 

‘‘What!” I cried enthusiastically, “would you entrust me with 
Alexandrine’s education?” 

“Could I put her in better hands? I’d be delighted to have you 
take charge of her. Moreover, it is Saint-Fond’s wish that she keep 
the most intimate company with you.” 

“And what is causing the delay in this marriage?” 

“IT am in mourning for my last wife, you know.” 

“Do you defer to conventional usages ?” 

“Occasionally, for the sake of appearances; though it goes 
fearfully against the grain.” 

“One further word, dear Noirceuil: you are very sure this 
woman you propose to introduce me to will not become my rival ?” 

“You are thinking of your position with Saint-Fond? Fear not. 
Saint-Fond knew her long before he met you, he still amuses himself 
with her; but Madame de Clairwil would not consent to undertake 
your functions, and, for his part, the Minister would not obtain 
anything like the same pleasure from having her exercise them.” 

“Ah,” I exclaimed, “you are divine, both of you, and your 
generosity toward me will be very fully rewarded by my zeal in the 
service of your passions. Issue me orders, I shall be only too happy, 


264 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


always, to be the instrument of your debauches and the main acces- 
sory to your crimes.” 

I was not to see my lover again until after I executed the task 
he had assigned me; on the eve of the appointed day I was exhorted 
to be firm; and on the morrow the dear old gentleman appeared. 
Before we sat down at table I employed all my skill to mend his 
opinion of his son, and was quite taken aback to discover that, in- 
deed, it would not be at all difficult to set things straight between 
them. Therefore I hastily shifted my tack. "Tis not a reconciliation 
we want now, said I to myself; if that happens, I lose both the 
opportunity for the crime [ am in a perfect itch to commit, and the 
twelve hundred thousand francs promised me for bringing it off; 
let’s cease negotiations anc. start to act. Administering the drug was 
child’s play ; the old man collapses, he is trundled out, and two days 
later I learn to my considerable satisfaction that he is no more, his 
death having been hideously painful. 

It was but an hour or so after he expired that his son arrived 
for one of his semiweekly suppers at my house. Poor weather forced 
us to hold it indoors; and Noirceuil was the one other guest present. 
I'd readied three little girls of fourteen or fifteen, prettier than you 
can imagine; a Paris convent had supplied them to me at the price 
of a hundred thousand francs a head—I’d stopped bargaining ever 
since Saint-Fond had agreed to cover costs. 

“These,” said I, presenting them to the Minister, “will console 
you for the loss you have just sustained.” 

“It does not overly affect me, Juliette,” said the Minister, 
kissing me, “I’d willingly send fifteen such blackguards to their 
death every day, and without an ace of compunction. My one regret 
is that he suffered so little; he was a most contemptible clown.” 

“But, you know,” I said, “it wouldn’t have taken much to 
change his attitude ?” 

“You acted properly in not encouraging him to do so. I 
shudder at the thought of still having to endure the beggar’s exist- 
ence. I even resent having to bury him; but for some loathsome 
prejudices, I’d have the pleasure of flinging his corpse on the dung 
heap and watching it devoured by vermin.” 

And, as if eager to forget, the libertine turned immediately 
to the job, my three maids were assessed. There was nothing the 


Juliette & 265 


fiercest critic could find fault with: size, shape, birth, mint condition, 
youth, looks, they were all there; but I noticed that neither of the 
two friends was stiffening in the least, and satiety is not easy to 
please : twas apparent they were not content, but did not, however, 
dare complain. 

“Speak up,” said I, “if these objects don’t satisfy you, you 
must tell me what you want. For you must admit, I cannot hope to 
guess what it would be that outdoes this.” 

“No,” sighed Saint-Fond, who was having himself handled by 
two of the little girls, whose efforts were proving fruitless, “there’s 
no one to blame unless it’s Noirceuil and myself. We’re exhausted, 
we've just been performing horrors, and I haven’t the faintest idea 
what’s to be done to revive us now.” 

“Perhaps,” I suggested, “if you were to recount your feats, 
you might, from the telling, rediscover the strength to commit fresh 
infamies.”’ 

‘We can at least try,” said Noirceuil. . 

‘Well then, off with the clothes,” said Saint-Fond, ‘‘you too, 
Juliette, undress yourself, and listen to us.” 

Two of the girls converged upon Noirceuil, one sucked him, 
he tongued the other and palpated both their asses; the frigging of 
the narrator was confided to me, and while speaking, he spanked 
the third maiden’s behind; and here follow the atrocities Saint- 
Fond divulged: 

“I led my daughter to where my father lay dying, Noirceuil 
was with me; we drew the shutters, we bolted the doors, and then” 
—and the lecher’s prick rose, nodding as though in confirmation of 
what he was saying—” and then I most barbarously announced to 
my father that this that had befallen him, and the agonies he was 
undergoing, were my work; upon my instructions, I told him, you 
had poisoned him and I advised him to think on death. Then raising 
my daughter’s skirts, I sodomized her before his eyes. Noirceuil, 
who adores me when I commit infamies, had been fucking me very 
briskly; but when the rascal saw Alexandrine’s ass bared to the 
light, he soon replaced me in the breach . . . and I, bending over the 
bed, forced the old man to frig me, and while he fisted my prick, I 
slowly strangled him: I gave up my fuck at the same moment he 
gave up the ghost, and Noirceuil simultaneously discharged into 


266 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


my daughter’s fundament. Ah, the joy that was mine! Foul accursed 
unnatural son who all at one stroke was guilty of parricide, incest, 
murder, sodomy, pimping, prostitution. Oh, Juliette, Juliette! never 
in my life had I been so happy. See what it does to me just to recite 
those voluptuous exploits, my prick’s as stiff as it was this after- 
noon.”’ 

Whereupon the leclier has at one of the little girls, and while 
he proceeds to maculate her in every part, he would have Noirceuil 
and me abuse another of the children within his view. We improvise 
awful things; Nature, outraged in those girls, becomes frenziedly 
operative in Saint-Fond, and the scapegrace is near to shedding his 
fuck, when, so as not to squander his forces, he prudently withdraws 
from the ass of the novice in order to perforate the other two. 
Exercising faultless self-control that day, he triumphed six times 
in a row, and for his stare Noirceuil had no buds, but full-blown 
roses only. Howbeit, the latter made the most of the little that was 
left to him, and the whole while he fucked, and he fucked at 
a leisurely pace, he kissed my ass and Saint-Fond’s too, he pumped 
them both, and drank u> the farts we amused ourselves producing 
for him. 

Then ’twas suppertime, I alone was invited to partake of the 
feast, but nude; the litt.e girls lay scattered about the table, light 
was provided by the candles we had stuck in their asses; and as 
these candles were none of them very long, and as the supper lasted 
on and on, all their thighs were severely scorched. Earlier we had 
bound them fast to the table to hold them still, and the gags of 
wadded cotton we had inserted in their mouths saved our conver- 
sation from being disturbed by their clamorings. The three cande- 
labras diverted our libertines throughout the meal; and I, reaching 
out from time to time tc verify their state, found them both in very 
merry form indeed. 

“Noirceuil,’’ said Saint-Fond, while our little novices were 
aroasting, ‘‘do, please, explain to us, manipulating your metaphysics 
prettily as you are wont to do, do explain to us, how ’tis possible 
we arrive at pleasure in the one case through the sight of others 
undergoing pain, and in the other, through suffering pain ourselves.” 

“Pay me close heed,” said Noirceuil, “I'll give you the thing 
detailed and demonstrated. 


Juliette 267 


‘Pain,’ logically defined, ‘is nothing other than a sentiment 
of hostility in the soul toward the body it animates, the which it 
signifies through certain movements that conflict with the body’s 
physical organization.’ So says Nicole, who perceived in man an 
ethereal substance, which he called soul, and which he differentiated 
from the material substance we call body. I, however, who will 
have none of this frivolous stuff and who consider man as some- 
thing on the order of an absolutely material plant, I shall simply 
say that pain is the consequence of a defective relationship between 
objects foreign to us and the organic molecules composing us; in 
such wise that instead of composing harmoniously with those that 
make up our neural fluids, as they do in the commotion of pleasure, 
the atoms emanating from these foreign objects strike them aslant, 
crookedly, sting them, repulse them, and never fuse with them. Still, 
though the effects are negative, they are effects nonetheless, and 
whether it be pleasure or pain brewing in us, you will always have 
a certain impact upon the neural fluids. Now, what prevents this 
painful commotion—infinitely sharper and more active than the 
other—from exciting in the said fluid the same conflagration 
propagated there by the impact of the atoms emanating from ob- 
jects of pleasure? and, stirred for the sake of being stirred, what 
prevents me from becoming accustomed, through habit, to being 
no less suitably agitated by the atoms that repel than by the others 
that blend? Weary of the effects that only produce a simple sensa- 
tion, why should I not become accustomed to receiving the same 
pleasure from those that produce a poignant sensation? Both cate- 
gories of shock are sustained in the same place; the only difference 
between them is that one is violent and the other mild; but from the 
standpoint of the blasé individual, is not the first greatly to be 
preferred to the second? Is there anything commoner than to see, 
on the one hand, people who have accustomed their palates to a 
pleasurable irritation, and next to them, others who couldn't put 
up with that irritation for an instant? Is it not now true—my hy- 
pothesis once accepted—that man’s practice, in his pleasures, is 
an attempt to move the objects which procure him his enjoyment 
in the same way he himself is moved, and that these proceedings 
are what are termed, in the metaphysics of pleasure-taking, effects 
of his delicacy? What then shou'd appear odd in the man who, 


268 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


endowed with organs of the kind we have just depicted, through 
the same procedures as his adversary, and through the same prin- 
ciples of delicacy, fancies he moves the pleasure-procuring object 
by means whereby he himself is affected? He is no more wrong 
than the other, he has only done what the other has done. The 
consequences are different, I grant you; but the initial motivations 
are identical; the first has been no crueler than the second, and 
neither of them is open to blame: upon the pleasure-procuring 
object both have employed the same means they themselves use to 
procure their own pleasure. 

‘But,’ replies he who is subjected to a brutal emotion, ‘but 
this doesn’t please me.’ ’Tis altogether possible; it now remains 
to be seen whether forc2 will succeed with you where persuasion 
has failed. If not, then begone, leave me alone; if, to the contrary, 
my wealth, my influence, or my station gives me either some 
authority over you or some certainty of being able to stifle your 
complaints, then submit without a murmur to everything it pleases 
me to impose upon you, for have my enjoyment I must and shall, 
and I can obtain it only by tormenting you and seeing your tears 
flow. But in no case have you the right to be surprised or to re- 
proach me, because I am acting in accordance with the way Nature 
designed me, am following the bent she imparted to me, and 
because, in a word, in fo-cing you to accede to my harsh and brutal 
lusts, they alone which are capable of leading me to the uppermost 
pitch of pleasure, I act oursuant to the same principle of delicacy 
as the tepid swain who knows nought but the roses of a sentiment 
whereof I recognize onl the thorns; for I, torturing you, rending 
you limb from limb, I am merely doing the one thing that is able 
to move me, just as he. sorrowfully encunting his mistress, does 
that which alone moves him agreeably; but he can have his effemi- 
nate delicacy, it’s not for me—why? because it cannot possibly 
move organs so solidly made, of such tough fiber as mine. 

“Yes, my friends,” Noirceuil went on, “it is, you may be sure, 
impossible for any person who finds authentic pleasure in lewd 
and voluptuous activities. ever really to combine their practice with 
that of delicacy, which unto these delights is nought but the very 
kiss of death and which is based upon the premise that joy is to be 
shared, a premise no one who intends seriously to enjoy himself 


Juliette -» 269 


can ever accept: shared, all enjoyment becomes dilute, the wine 
becomes watered. The truth is generally recognized: encourage or 
allow the object which serves for your pleasure to take enjoyment 
therein, and straightway you discover that it is at your expense; 
there is no more selfish passion than lust; none that is severer in 
its demands; smitten stiff by desire, ’tis with yourself you must 
be solely concerned, and as for the object that serves you, it must 
always be considered as some sort of victim, destined to that 
passion’s fury. Do not all passions require victims? Well then! 
in the lustful act the passive object is that of our lubricious passion; 
spare it not if you would attain your end; the intenser the sufferings 
of this object, the more entire its humiliation, its degradation, the 
more thorough will be your enjoyment. They are not pleasures you 
must cause this object to taste, but impressions you must produce 
upon it; and that of pain being far keener than that of pleasure, 
it is beyond all question preferable that the commotion produced 
in our nervous system by this external spectacle be created by pain 
rather than by pleasure. There you have it explained, the mania 
common to that crowd of libertines, who, like us, must, if they 
are to obtain successful erections and emit sperm, commit acts of 
the most atrocious cruelty, gorge themselves on the blood of 
victims. Some there are whose pricks are not even faintly to be 
stirred, save when they contemplate that doomed object of their 
lubricious fury—and save when they themselves are uniquely re- 
sponsible for the violent sufferings it is undergoing. You wish to 
subject your nerves to a powerful agitation; you very rightly sup- 
pose that the painful commotion will prove stronger than the 
pleasurable; so you employ it with favorable results. ‘But beauty,’ 
I hear some sentimental imbecile protest, ‘beauty melts, interests, 
it invites to sweetness, to forgiveness: how is one to resist the tears 
of the pretty girl who, clasping her hands together, implores mercy 
of her executioner?’ Indeed! This is precisely what one is after, 
it is from this agitation, this terror the libertine in question extracts 
his most delicious enjoyment; would he not be in a sorry plight if 
he were to have to act upon an inert, insensible body? and the 
objection cited is quite as ridiculous as that of the man who main- 
tained you should never eat mutton because sheep are mild animals. 
Lust’s passion will be served; it demands, it militates, it tyrannizes, 


270 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it must therefore be appeased, and to its satisfaction all other 
conditions are totally irrelevant. Beauty, virtue, innocence, candor, 
misfortune, the object we covet will not be sheltered by any of 
these. To the contrary. Beauty tends to excite us further; virtue, 
innocence, candor embellish the object; misfortune puts it into our 
power, renders it mallea le: hence, all those qualities tend only to 
inflame us the more, anc. we should look upon them all simply as 
vehicles to our passions. More, these qualities afford us the oppor- 
tunity of violating another prohibition: I allude to the variety of 
pleasure derived from szcrilege or the profanation of objects that 
expect our worship. That beautiful girl is an object of reverence 
for fools; making her the target of my liveliest and rudest passions, 
I experience the double pleasure of sacrificing to that passion 
both a beautiful object and one before which the crowd bows down. 
No need to expand upo. this idea, it has only to enter the mind 
and one’s brain whirls. But one does not always have such objects 
ready to hand; however, one has habituated oneself to achieving 
pleasure through tyranny; and one is anxious to enjoy oneself every 
day—what then? Why, one must learn to delight in other, lesser 
pleasures: hardheartedness toward the downtrodden, the refusal 
to succor them, the act cf plunging them oneself into misery if one 
possibly can—these in scme sort substitute for the sublime pleasure 
of causing a debauchery-bject to suffer. The sight of these wretches 
is a spectacle which very well lays the groundwork for the com- 
motion we are accustomed to experience upon receiving a dolorous 
impression; they reach out to us, implore our aid, we withhold it— 
there’s the spark; a futher step, and there’s the fire lit, thence 
are crimes born, and nothing is surer to touch off the explosion 
of pleasure; but I have fulfilled my task. How, you wanted to 
know, how can one accede to pleasure through suffering pain, or 
making others suffer it? I have answered you with a theoretical 
demonstration. Let’s now confirm it in practice, and hewing to 
the line of the argument, I would request that the tortures inflicted 
upon these young ladies be piercing, that is to say, as piquant as 
it is within our power tc make them.” 

We rose from the table, and rather more in the spirit of jest 
than of charity, the victims’ hurts were briefly looked to. I can’t 
say why, but that evening Noirceuil seemed more than usually 


Juliette & 271 


enamored of my ass; he could not leave off kissing it, toying with it, 
praising it, sucking and fucking it; twenty times over he embug- 
gered me; he would suddenly snap his prick out and give it to be 
sucked by the little girls; next, he would return to me and slap 
my flanks and buttocks with extraordinary force; he forgot him- 
self even to the point of frigging my clitoris. All this heated me 
prodigiously, and my behavior must have appeared frightfully 
whorish to my friends. But how was one to satisfy oneself with a 
trio of exhausted children and two worn-out, shrunk-pizzled liber- 
tines? I proposed the idea of having myself fucked before them 
by my valets; but Saint-Fond, reeling with wine and aboil with 
ferocity, objected, saying that he'd have nothing brought in from 
the outside unless it was a brace of tigers, and that since there was 
fresh meat available, it ought to be devoured before it spoiled. 
Thereupon, he set upon those three charming maids’ little asses: 
he pinched them, bit, scratched, tore them; blood was already 
flowing left and right when, whirling toward us, his prick glued 
up against his belly, he declared very bitterly that it was a bad day, 
he simply could not think up the means to make the victims suffer 
in the way he wished. 

“Everything that enters my mind today,” he said, “falls short 
of my desires; can’t we put our heads together and invent some- 
thing that will keep these whores three days in the most appalling 
death agonies ?” 

“Ah,” I said, “you'd discharge before they were halfway to 
- the grave, and the illusion dispelled, you’d come to their rescue.” 

“T am vexed, vexed indeed, Juliette,” Saint-Fond retorted, 
“to see that you do not know me better than that; how very gravely 
you are mistaken, my angel, if you believe my passions are the 
sole aliment to my cruelty. Ah, like Herod, I should like to prolong 
my ferocities beyond life itself; I am frenziedly barbaric when 
I'm stiff, yes, and cold-bloodedly cruel when I’ve shed my fuck. 
Very well, Juliette,” the villain continued, ‘look here: I’m going 
to discharge, we’ll begin the serious torturing of these sluts once 
every drop of fuck is out of my balls, and you'll see whether or 
not I relent.’ 

‘‘Saint-Fond, you seem greatly aroused,” said Noirceuil, “your 
speech makes that amply clear. Sperm is to be darted, there’s the 


272 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


crux of the thing; it can be accomplished right away if you take 
my advice. "Tis this and ’tis simple: we shall impale these young 
ladies on spits, and white they roast there over the fire, Juliette, 
frigging us, will baste three handsome joints of beef with our fuck.” 

“Oh, by Christ,” said Saint-Fond, rubbing his member on the 
bleeding buttocks of the youngest and prettiest of the trio, “I swear 
to you that this one here will suffer worse than that.” 

“Yes? What the devil are you scheming to do to her?” asked 
Noirceuil, who had jus: scabbarded his weapon anew in my ass. 

“You'll see,” was the rascal’s reply. 

And he sets to work upon her with his powerful hands, he 
breaks her fingers one by one, dislocates her arms and legs, and 
runs the point of a little stiletto about a thousand times into her, 
to the depth of about an inch. 

“I think,” said Noirceuil, still housed in my bowels, ‘“‘she’d 
have suffered quite as rmuch from a spitting.” 

“And spitted she is going to be,” Saint-Fond rejoins, “now 
she’s been gashed a bit. Punctured thus she'll be more sensitive to 
the heat than if she’d teen put to turn over the fire intact.” 

“I dare say you're right,” Noirceuil agrees; “let’s prepare 
the other two in the same manner.” 

I seize one, he takes the other, and still solidly implanted in 
my ass, the rascal puts her in the same state as she whom Saint- 
Fond has martyrized. [ imitate him and we soon have all of them 
roasting before a blazing fire, while Noirceuil, damning every god 
in the sky, discharges in my bum, and I, gripping Saint-Fond’s 
prick, spray his fuck won the three charred bodies of the unhappy 
victims of lust most dreadful. 

All three corpses were flung into a pit. 

We resumed our drinking. 

Invaded by new desires, the libertines called for mex; my 
lackeys were summoned, they were the whole night long laboring 
in Saint-Fond’s and Noirceuil’s insatiable asses; and for all that 
weren't able to lift the pricks of those gentlemen, whose verbal 
outbursts, however, were astonishing; and it was in the course of 
that séance that I recognized more clearly than ever before how 
certain it was these monsters were as cruel upon cold principle 
as in the greatest heat of passion. 


Juliette & 273 


A month after this adventure, Noirceuil introduced me to 
the woman he wished to have become my soul-mate. As his mar- 
riage to Alexandrine had been postponed yet again, this time 
owing to Saint-Fond’s bereavement, and because I think best not 
to describe that charming girl before I reach the appropriate 
point in my story—the point, that is, at which she came into my 
full possession—we’ll now turn our attentions to Madame de 
Clairwil and the arrangements I made with that unusual person to 
cement our liaison. 

Representing her to me, Noirceuil had been authorized in 
his use of superlatives. Madame de Clairwil was tall, splendidly 
proportioned; her glance, always keen, was often too fiery to 
withstand; but her eyes, large, dark, were more imposing than 
pleasing, and in general the aspect of this woman was more 
majestic than agreeable: her mouth, somewhat rounded, was fresh, 
her lips sensual, her hair, jet-black, fell to her knees; her nose 
was modeled to perfection, her brow was regal, rich were the 
lines of her bust, wonderfully smooth was her skin, though ’twas 
not untinged a little with sallowness, her flesh was ripe but firm; 
in short, this was the figure of Minerva adorned with Venus’ 
amenities. Nevertheless, whether because I was the younger, or 
because my physiognomy had in grace what hers had in nobility, 
men invariably found me the more pleasing. Madame de Clairwil 
astonished, I was content to beguile; she compelled men’s ad- 
miration, I seduced them. 

To these imperious looks Madame de Clairwil joined a very 
lofty intelligence; she was exceptionally knowledgeable, I have 
never known her peer for an enemy to prejudices . . . which she 
had rooted out of herself while yet a child; and I have never 
known a woman to carry philosophy so far. As well, she had 
numerous talents, her command of English and Italian was com- 
plete, she was a born actress, danced like Terpsichore, was an 
accomplished chemist, physicist, made verse prettily, drew nicely, 
was well read in history, had geography at her fingertips, was 
no mean musician, wrote like Sévigné, but went perhaps a trifle 
too far in her witty sallies, the regular consequence being an in- 
sufferable overbearing way with those who failed to come up to 
her level; and almost no one ever did; she used to say that I was 


274 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the one female in whom, until now, she had detected a trace of true 
intelligence. 

This splendid personage had been five years a widow. She 
had never borne any children, to them she had an aversion which, 
in a woman, always denotes lack of feeling; one might fairly say 
that for lack of sensibility Madame de Clairwil had not an equal. 
She indeed prided herself upon never having shed a tear, upon 
never having been touched in the least by the fate of the unlucky. 
“My soul is callous, it is impassive,” said she, “I put any sentiment 
whatever at defiance to attain it, with the exception of pleasure. 
I am mistress of that soul’s movements and affections, of its desires, 
of its impulsions; with me, everything is under the unchallenged 
control of mind; and there’s worse yet,” she continued, “for my 
mind is appalling. But I am not complaining, I cherish my vices, 
I abhor virtue; [ am the sworn enemy of all religions, of all gods 
and godlings, I fear neither the ills of life nor what follows death; 
and when you're like me, you’re happy.” 

With such a character, Madame de Clairwil, one was swift to 
guess, might have adulators in good number, but very few were 
her friends; she no more believed in friendship than in benevolence, 
and no more in virtue than in gods. Along with all this went 
enormous wealth, a splendid house in Paris, an enchanting one in 
the country, luxuries of every kind, the age when a woman is at 
her peak, an iron constitution, faultless health. If there be any 
happiness at all in this world, then it cannot but belong to the 
individual in command of all these advantages and attributes. 

At our very first mezting Madame de Clairwil confided in me, 
giving evidence of a frankness I found startling in a woman 
who, as I have just done telling’‘you, was so proudly persuaded of 
her superiority; but she was never aloof toward me, I must say it 
out of fairness to her. 

“Noirceuil described you accurately,” she said; ‘‘’tis evident 
we have similar minds, similar tastes; we seem made to live to- 
gether, so let us join forces, we shall go far. But above all, let’s 
banish all restraints—from the start they were invented for fools 
only. Elevated characters, proud spirits, quick intelligences like 
ours make short shrift of all those popular curbs; they are aware 
that happiness lies on the farther side, they march courageously 


oy 


Juliette & 275 


to its attainment, flouting the paltry laws, the sterile virtues, and 
the harebrained religions of those abject, worthless, swinish men 
who, so it does seem, exist only in order to dishonor Nature.” 

Several days later, Clairwil, with whom I was already grown 
infatuated, came to supper. We were two and alone. It was then, 
at this second encounter, we poured out our hearts to each other, 
acknowledged our peculiarities, detailed our sentiments. Oh, what 
a soul she had, that Clairwil! I believe that if vice itself could 
dwell in this world, it would have chosen the depths of that perverse 
being for the seat of its empire. 

In a moment of mutual confidence before we were to betake 
ourselves to table, Clairwil leaned close to me; we were indolently 
reclining in a nook paneled by mirrors, velvet-covered pillows 
supported our heaving flanks; the soft light seemed to beckon 
to love and to favor its pleasures. 

“Is it not true, my angel,” said she, kissing my breasts, licking 
my nipples, “that ‘tis through masturbating each other two such 
women as ourselves must become acquainted ?” 

And drawing up my skirts and petticoats as she uttered those 
words, the tribade darted her tongue deep into my mouth; and 
libertine fingers touched the mark. 

“It is,” she observed, ‘there pleasure lies, it slumbers there, 
on that bed of roses. My sweetest love, wouldst have me wake it? 
Oh, Juliette, I shall put you in ecstasies, will you permit me to 
catch fire from their heat? Little minx! your mouth gives me 
answer, your tongue hunts mine, invites it to voluptuousness. Ah! - 
do unto me that which I have done unto you, and let’s die in 
pleasure’s embrace.” 

“Let us undress,” I suggested to my friend, “lewd debauch 
calls for nakedness—and, do you know, I’ve not the faintest idea 
how you are made, I wish to see everything, I must, I must. Let’s 
be rid of these inopportune raiments—ah, I want to see your heart 
throb, your breast quiver from the excitement I cause in you.” 

“What an idea,” Clairwil murmured, “it hints at your char- 
acter, Juliette, I adore it; we'll do just whatever you like.” 

And in a trice my friend was as naked as I; several minutes 
went by during which we studied each other in silence. The sight 
of the beauties nature had lavished upon me began to inflame Clair- 


276 ed THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


wil; I feasted my eyes upon hers. Never has there been such a 
lovely figure, never such a bosom. . . . Those buttocks! O God! 
twas the ass of that Aphrodite the Greeks reverenced; and how 
deliciously it was cleft, unwearyingly I kissed those wonders; and 
my friend, at first lettinz me most obligingly have my way with her, 
proceeded next to pay back my caresses a hundredfold. 

‘“‘Now don’t fret, leave everything to me,” she said, having 
me lie down on the ottoman and spread my legs wide, “let me show 
you I am capable of giving a woman pleasure.” 

Whereupon two of her fingers began to work my clitoris and 
my asshole, the while her tongue, plunged a goodly depth in my 
cunt, avidly lapped up the fuck these titillations started. Never 
before had I been thus frigged; three times in a row I discharged 
into her mouth with such transports I thought I’d faint away. 
Clairwil, insatiable in ier thirst for my fuck, and making ready 
to procure herself a fourth round, deftly and knowingly altered 
her approach; so that it was now one finger she inserted into my 
cunt, another wherewith she played trills on my clitoris, and her 
agile, her voluptuous tongue probed into my anus... . 

“What skill! What consideration!’ I exclaimed. ‘‘Ah, Clair- 
wil, you are like to be my undoing.” 

And further spurts of whey were the product of that divine 
creature’s industry. 

“Eh then?” she cemanded, when I had returned somewhat 
to my senses, “what say you, do I not know how to frig a woman? 
I adore women; is it then any wonder that I am versed in the art 
of giving them pleasure? What else could you expect? I’m de- 
praved, dear heart. Is it my fault if Nature gave me tastes that 
differ from the ordinary? I find nothing more unjust than a law 
that prescribes a mingling of the sexes in order to procure oneself 
a pure pleasure; and w.at sex is more apt than ours in doing unto 
each other that which we do singly to delight ourselves? Must we 
not, of necessity, be more successful in pleasing each other than 
that being, our complete opposite, who can offer us none but the 
joys at the farthest remove from those our sort of existence 
requires?” 

‘What! Clairwil, do you mean to say that you dislike men?” 

“I use them because my temperament would have it so, but 


Juliette & 277 


I scorn and detest them nonetheless: I’d not be adverse to destroy- 
ing every last one of those by the mere sight of whom I have always 
felt myself debased.” 

“What pride!” 

“It’s a characteristic of mine, Juliette; that pride is coupled 
with frankness. I am plain-spoken; it is a means to facilitate our 
early acquaintance.” 

“Cruelty is implied in what you say; if your desires were to 
be translated into actions—”’ 

“If? But they very often are. My heart is hard, and I am far 
from believing sensitiveness preferable to the apathy I luckily 
enjoy. Oh, Juliette,” she continued, donning her clothes, ‘“‘you 
perhaps entertain illusions regarding this dangerous softhearted- 
ness, this compassion, this sensibility, the having whereof is thought 
creditable by so many churls. 

“Sensibility, my dear, is the source of all virtues and likewise 
of all vices. It was sensibility brought Cartouche to the scaffold, 
just as it caused the name of Titus to be writ gilt-lettered in the 
annals of benevolence. Owing to excessive sensibility, we behave 
virtuously; owing to excessive sensibility, we take joy in misbe- 
having; the individual lacking sensibility is an inert mass, equally 
incapable of good or evil, and human only insofar as he has the 
human shape. This purely physical sensibility depends upon the 
conformation of our organs, upon the delicacy of our senses, and, 
more than all the rest, upon the nature of our nervous humours 
within which I locate all the affections of man in general. Up- 
bringing and, afterward, habit mold in this or that direction the 
portion of sensibility everyone receives from Nature; and selfish- 
ness, or the instinct of self-preservation, aids upbringing and habit 
to settle permanently upon this or that choice. But as the sort of 
education we are apt to receive unfailingly prepares us ill and 
indeed misleads us, the moment that education is over with, the 
inflammation produced in the electrical fluid by the impact of 
foreign objects, an operation we term the effect of the passions, 
begins to determine our habitual bent for good or for evil. If this 
inflammation is slight, whether because of the organs’ denseness, 
which softens the impact and lessens the pressure of the foreign 
object upon the neural fluid, or becayse of the brain’s sluggishness 


278 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


in communicating the effect of this pressure to the fluid, or again 
because of this fluid’s reluctance to be set in motion, its turgidity, 
then the effects of our sensibility dispose us to virtue. If, in that 
other case, foreign objects act in a forceful manner upon our 
organs, if they penetrate them violently, if they stir into brisk 
motion the neural fluid particles which circulate in the hollow 
of the nerves, then our sensibility is such as to dispose us to vice. 
If the foreign objects’ action is stronger yet, it leads us to crime, 
and finally to atrocities :f the effect attains its ultimate intensity. 
But we notice that in every case the sensibility is simply a mechanism, 
that some degree or other of virtue or vice originates with it, that 
it is the sensibility which is responsible for whatever we do. When 
we detect an excess of sensibility in some young person, we may 
predict his future with confidence, and safely wager that some 
fine day this sensibility will see him a criminal; for it is not, as some 
may be prone to imagine, the species of sensibility, but the degree 
of sensibility that leads to crime; and the individual in whom its 
action is slow will be disposed to good, just as, very certainly, 
he in whom this action wreaks havoc will do evil, evil being more 
piquant, more attractive than good. Therefore ’tis toward evil that 
violent effects tend, following the general principle according to 
which all like effects, moral no less than physical, seek each other 
out and combine. 

“And so there appears to be no doubt that the necessary 
procedure with a young person one was endeavoring to train up 
for life would be to blint that sensibility; blunting it, you will 
perhaps lose a few weak virtues, but you will eliminate a great 
many vices, and under a form of government which severely 
castigates all vices and which never rewards virtues, it is infinitely 
better to learn not to do evil than to strive to do good. There is 
nothing dangerous whatever in not doing good, whereas the doing 
of evil may be fraught with perils when one is still too young to 
appreciate the importance of concealing those acts of wickedness 
invincible Nature constrains us to commit. I may go farther: 
doing good is the most useless thing in the world and the most 
essential thing in the world is not doing evil, and this, not from 
the standpoint of one’s self, for the greatest of all joys is often 
born in excessive evil only, nor from the standpoint of religion, 


Juliette eb 279 


for nothing is so irrelevant to worldly well-being as what relates 
to this mummery about God, but solely from the standpoint of 
the law of the land, whereof the infraction, delightful as it may be, 
always, when discovered, precipitates the beginner into serious 
difficulties. 

“Hence there would be no danger developing in our hypo- 
thetical young individual a heart oriented in such wise that he 
would never perform a good deed, but at the same time would 
never feel the impulse to perform an evil one either—until, at 
least, he had attained the age when experience would make him 
realize the indispensability of hypocrisy. Now, in such a case, the 
appropriate steps to take would be radically to deaden the sensi- 
bility immediately when you noticed that, too lively, it was threaten- 
ing to lead to vicious conduct. For here I suppose that from the 
very apathy to which you would reduce his spirit some dangers 
could issue; these dangers, however, will always be far smaller 
than those his excessive sensibility might breed. Granted a sufh- 
cient subduing of sensibility, a consequent lowering of sensitivity 
and temperature, what crimes are committed will always be com- 
mitted dispassionately, and hence the hypothetical pupil will have 
time enough to cover up his traces and divert suspicion, whereas 
those committed in a state of effervescence will, before he has the 
opportunity to collect his wits, tumble him into the gravest trouble. 
The cold-blooded crimes will be perhaps less splendid than somber, 
but they will be less ready of detection, because the phlegm and 
premeditation wherewith they will be perpetrated will guarantee 
leisure to so arrange them as not to have to fear their consequences; 
the other category, those perpetrated barefacedly, brashly, thought- 
lessly, impulsively, will speedily bring their author to the gibbet. 
And your chief concern shall not be whether your pupil, when a 
mature man, commits or doesn’t commit crimes, because in fact 
crime is a natural occurrence to which this or that human being is 
the accidental and often involuntary instrument, for whether he 
will or no, man is as a toy in Nature’s hands when his organs 
put him there; your chief concern, I say, must be to see to it that 
this pupil commits the least dangerous offense, having regard 
to the laws of the country wherein he resides, in such sort that if 
the pettiest is punished and the most frightful is not, then ’tis 


280 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


very assuredly the most frightful you must let him commit. For, 
once again, it is not from crime you must shelter him, but from 
the sword that smites the perpetrator of crime: crime entails no 
disadvantages, its punishment entails many. To a man’s welfare, 
it is all one whether he does or does not commit crimes; but it is 
most essential to this same welfare that he not be punished for 
those he commits, whatever their kind or degree of wickedness. 
A teacher’s foremost duty to the pupil in his care would then be 
to cultivate in him a disposition toward the less dangerous of the 
two evils, since, unfortunately, it is but too true that he must 
incline in the one direction or in the other; and experience will 
make it very clear to you, that the vices proceeding from hard- 
heartedness are much less dangerous than those caused by excess 
of sensibility, the excellent reason for this being that the lucidity 
and calm characteristic of the former ensure the means to avoid 
punishment, whereas there is nothing more obvious than that he 
will be punished who, lacking the time to make suitable provisions, 
to take the basic precautions, flies blindly into action in the heat 
of passion. Thus, in the first case, that is, where the young person 
is left to be impelled by his whole sensibility, he will perform 
a few good deeds which practice reveals utterly futile; in the second, 
he will perform no good deeds, which will mean not the slightest 
loss to him; and owing <o the way you have shaped him, he will 
commit none but those infractions which may be committed without 
risk. But your pupil will become cruel—and what shall the effects 
of this cruelty be? With one who has a little substance to him, 
they will consist in a stout refusal to act at the behest of a pity 
his mind and heart, molded by you, will not acknowledge or even 
register; I see no danger in that. "Tis but a matter of one or two 
virtuous performances tle fewer, and there is nothing more useless 
than virtue, since unto kim who exercises it, it is a cross to bear, 
and since, in our climes, it is never rewarded. With a bold and 
rigorous spirit, this cruelty in action will consist in furtive crimes, 
whose sharp impact will, by its friction, heat the electrical particles 
in the fluid in his nerves, and will perhaps mean death for a number 
of persons of little account. Where’s the danger here? for, in full 
possession of his faculty of judgment and right reason, he will 
proceed coolly, carefully, with such secrecy, with such art that 


Juliette 2 281 


the torch of Justice will never be able to bring the thing to light; 
thus will he be happy, and at no risk; what else does he want? 
It isn’t evil, but the news thereof leaked out, that is perilous; 
and the most odious crime of all, if well concealed, causes infinitely 
less embarrassment than the slightest foible become public. Now 
consider the other case. The entirety of his sensitive faculties at 
his command and operative, this pupil espies an object and takes 
a liking to it; he would have it, his parents stand in his path: 
accustomed to giving the freest possible rein to his sensibility, 
he’ll poison, he’ll butcher everyone who, keeping him from that 
object, frustrates his purposes, and he’ll perish broken on the wheel. 
You observe that in treating. of both cases I have supposed the 
worst coming to the worst; I have merely offered one example of 
the dangers inherent in either situation, and I leave you to imagine 
as many others as you like. If after you have done calculating you 
end by approving, as I am very sure you shall, the extinction of all 
sensibility in a pupil, then the first branch to lop off the tree is 
necessarily pity. And actually what is pity? A purely egotistical 
sentiment: seeing others beset by woe, we pity them because we 
fear lest that same woe befall us. Show me the man who, owing 
to his nature, is exempt from all the ills that afflict humankind, 
_and not only will that man have no pity whatever, he won’t even 

know the meaning of the word. A yet greater proof that pity is 
no more than a purely passive commotion excited in persons of 
the skittish hysterical sort, owing to, or in proportion to, the 
misfortune of our fellows, is that, if we are immediate witnesses 
to it, we are always more sensitive to this misfortune, even though 
the sufferer be a total stranger, than we are to the calamity sus- 
tained a hundred leagues away by our very best friend. And 
how explain the difference in our reactions save by the fact 
that this feeling is nothing but the physical result of the accidental 
commotion inspired in our nervous system? Well, I ask whether 
such a feeling can be deserving of any respect and whether it can 
be viewed otherwise than as feebleness? More, it is an exceedingly 
painful feeling, since it occurs only through a comparison which 
harks us back to misfortune, and causes us to brood thereon. 
Contrariwise, its extinction procures us joy, since, as we extinguish 
it, in our sang-froid we glimpse a situation we are exempted from, 


282 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


and this permits us a favorable comparison—destroyed the moment 
we soften to the point of pitying the unlucky, which we do when 
tormented by the cruel thought that perhaps we ourselves may 
be in a similar plight tomorrow. Defy this annoying fear, learn 
to confront this danger undreadingly, and there’s an end to your 
pity for others. 

“A further proof thit this feeling is nought but sheer weakness 
and pusillanimity is the particular frequency with which it is found 
in women and children, and its rarity in those individuals whose 
organs have acquired all suitable strength and vigor. For the same 
reason, the poor man is commonly he of the open heart; dwelling 
closer to misfortune than the rich man, more familiar with it, he 
is of readier sympathy. .All of which thus demonstrates that pity, 
far from being a virtue, is but a weakness born of fear and of woe, 
a weakness which must be combated with especial severity when 
one sets about the task of blunting excessive nervous sensitivity, 
this sensibility that is so completely incompatible with every tenet 
of philosophy. 

“There, Juliette, there they are, the principles that have led 
me to this tranquillity, this equanimity, to this stoicism which now 
enables me to do anythir.g and to endure anything without batting 
an eyelash. Make haste to initiate yourself into these mysteries,” 
continued that charming woman, as yet unaware of the point I had 
advanced to in these artizles. “‘Make haste to annihilate this stupid 
commiseration which will upset you every time you catch sight of 
woe howsoever trivial. Arriving at that stage, my angel, by dint of 
continued tests which wil soon have you convinced of the extreme 
difference between yourself and the alien object whose sad fate you 
lament, be persuaded the tears you shed over that individual cannot 
meliorate his circumstanzes one iota, and can only cause you afflic- 
tion; be equally sure thzt the succor you were to give him would 
mean no more than an insipid sensual pleasure for you, whereas 
the refusal of aid may )roduce a very keen one, Be furthermore 
persuaded that you will be tampering with the natural scheme by 
rescuing from the indigent class those persons Nature deliberately 
placed there; that, wise and entirely logical in all her operations, 
her designs regarding human beings are neither for us to fathom 
nor to thwart; that her designs are substantiated by the unequal 


Juliette & 283 


distribution of puissance among men, this necessarily implying 
unequal means, resources, conditions, and destinies. Avail yourself 
of examples out of history, Juliette, consult the authority of the 
ancients; you have been trained in the classics, recollect your read- 
ing. Remember the Emperor Licinius who, prescribing the harshest 
penalties, forbade all compassion toward the poor, and any sort of 
charity toward indigence. Remember that sect of Greek philos- 
ophers who maintained there was crime in seeking to meddle with 
the various shades in the Nature-ordained spectrum of social 
classes; and when you have developed your thought to the point I 
have, cease to deplore the loss of pity-prompted acts of virtue; 
for these virtuous acts, founded on egoism exclusively, are utterly 
unworthy of respect. Since it is by no means sure that there is good 
in extricating from misfortune the wretch Nature put there, it 
is far simpler to nip in the bud the sentiment whereby we are 
rendered sympathetic to his sufferings than to let it flower; and be 
all the while apprehensive lest our compassion, interfering with the 
order of things, be outrageous to Nature; the best course is to culti- 
vate in ourselves such a frame of mind as will enable us to look upon 
those sufferings with indifference and unconcern. Ah, dear friend! 
were you, like me, strong enough to advance one step further, had 
you the courage to take pleasure contemplating the sufferings of 
others, merely trom the agreeable thought of not experiencing them 
yourself, a thought which necessarily produces a very decided joy— 
were you able to go that far, no doubt but that it would represent 
a great achievement, since you’d have succeeded in turning some 
of life’s thorns into roses. Be equally certain, my heart, that men 
of the stamp of Denis, Nero, Louis XI, Tiberius, Wenceslas, 
Herod, Andronicus, Heliogabalus, Retz® based their happiness 
upon similar principles, and that if they were able without shudder- 
ing, without qualms to do all they did in the line of atrocity, it is 
obviously because they had mastered the technique of exploiting 
crime for lustful purposes. “Those men were monsters,’ a fool will 
tell me. So indeed they were, according to our ways of thinking and 
behaving; but from the point of view of Nature and in terms of 
her dictates, they were simply the instruments of her intentions: 
endowing them with their ferocious and bloodthirsty characters,

she appointed them to execute her laws. Thus, though they appear 
to have performed much evil, as that is defined by man-made law, 
they acted in admirable conformance to the law of Nature, whose 
aim is to destroy at least as much as she creates. No, no, those 
worthies wrought a substantial weal, since they put her desires 
into effect; whence it results that the individual who has a char- 
acter like these so-called tyrants’, or he who manages to raise his 
character to this level, will not only not steer clear of evil, but may 
even discover in the fulfillment of his designated or elected role 
a source of very potent joy which he will savor all the more fear- 
lessly, the more certain he is that, by means either of his cruelties 
or his disorders, he is -endering Nature a service no less useful 
than that a saint performs through the exercise of his capacities 
for good-doing and virtue. Fortify all this with examples, feed 
it upon practice; gaze often and long upon spectacles of woe; ac- 
custom yourself to refus ng aid to the downtrodden, to the unlucky, 
so that you become habituated to the idea and the sight of sufferers 
abandoned to their suffe ings; be the direct cause of some, of a few 
which are somewhat crueler, more atrocious than the everyday; 
and it won’t be long before you recognize that between the suffer- 
ings you provoke, and which do not affect you in the least, and the 
voluptuous vibration of your nerves, thrilled by the impact of these 
sufferings, even if this be merely the thrill that comes of contrasting 
weal and woe and finding the comparison heavily in your favor— 
you have no cause for z moment’s hesitation. Little by little your 
sensibility will deaden; you'll not have prevented great crimes, 
since, to the contrary, you'll have caused some to be committed and 
will yourself have perpetrated not a few, but at least you'll have 
done so phlegmatically, with this apathy which permits the veiling 
of the passions, and which, safeguarding lucidity, indispensable 
to the avoidance of disagreeable repercussions, is your guarantee 
against all dangers.” 

“Oh, Clairwil, I can’t imagine that with such attitudes you 
have impoverished yourself through good works.” 

“I am rich,” that extraordinary woman replied, “so rich that 
I am not even sure how much I have. Well, Juliette, I swear to you 
that I would prefer to throw all the money I own into the river 
than employ a penny of it in what fools call charities, prayers, or

alms; I believe such things are most harmful to humanity, fatal 
to the poor whose energies are sapped by the practice of bestowing 
largesses, and more dangerous yet for the wealthy man who be- 
lieves he has secured title to every virtue once he has given a crown 
or two to some priests or shiftless rascals, a certain means for 
masking his every vice the while encouraging the vices of others.” 

“Adorable woman,” I said to my friend, “knowing the position 
I hold in the Minister’s entourage, as I think you must, you cannot 
doubt that my moral outlook as regards the subjects you have been 
discussing is not a great deal purer than yours.” 

“Certainly,” said she, “I know all the services you render 
Saint-Fond; I have been his friend as well as Noirceuil’s for ages 
—how could I help but be familiar with those two scoundrels’ 
debauches? You collaborate in them, and that is laudable; were I 
needy I’d do the same, and I’d do it happily, for I positively wor- 
ship crime. But I also know, Juliette, that by laboring much in 
behalf of others you have, so far, labored little in your own; and 
with but two or three petty thefts to your credit you can still benefit 
from examples and lessons; so let me encourage you and steel you 
to more considerable undertakings, if indeed you really wish to be 
worthy of us.” 

“Ah,” said I, “I am already much in your debt; pray continue 
to instruct me, and rest assured you will nowhere find a more at- 
tentive nor an apter student. I am in your hands, there is nothing 
I'll not attempt at your side, guided by your advice; and from now 
on my whole ambition shall be someday to surpass my teacher. 
But, my best beloved, we are already forgetful of our pleasures: | 
received divine ones from you, you’ve not yet given me a chance 
to reciprocate, and I am keenly irnpatient to instill into your soul 
some spark of the heavenly fire you lately caused to blaze in mine.” 

“Juliette, you are delicious, truly. But I am too old for you. 
Are you aware that I am thirty? Ordinary things have long since 
palled. . .. To be moved ever so slightly, I must have recourse to 
refinements so coarse, episodes so potent—ere the sweet sap rise in 
me there must be such a quantity of preliminaries, of monstrous 
thoughts, of obscene gestures, actions; and if I am to discharge, I 
require... . But enough; my habits will aa a my transports

And then a brightness entered her eyes, a lewdness wetted her 
lips; she asked: 

‘Have you women in the house? Are they lascivious? Pretty 
or not, that doesn’t matter; you'll arouse me. But I could use a 
bevy of tolerably roguish, immodest, patient, vigorous, foul- 
mouthed creatures; and they needn’t bother to come into the 
room if they’re wearing a stitch of clothing. How many such 
women can you provide me?” 

“T have only four in my permanent hire,” I answered. “Four 
being enough for my emergency requirements.” 

“That’s exceedingly few. You can’t pretend to be poor. My 
dear, you ought to maintain a staff of at least twenty and change 
them all every week, futhermore. Ah, ’tis clear I'll have to teach 
you how to use the money you’re swimming in. Are you miserly? 
Not that there’s anything wrong with that. I idolize money, I’ve 
often frigged myself sitting amidst the heaps of louis d’or I’ve 
amassed, it’s the idea that I can do whatever I like with the money 
before my eyes, that’s what drives me wild. I find it quite natural 
that others have the same taste; but nevertheless I won’t have you 
deprive yourself: only fools are unable to understand that one can 
be simultaneously nigga-dly and lavish, that one can love wasteful 
squandering upon one’s pleasures and refuse a farthing to charity. 
Well, then. Send for your four women; and if you wish to see me 
discharge, find some switches.” 

“Switches ?” 

“Switches, rods, lashes, however you please to call them.” 

“Do you whip, my dear ?” 

“Until blood flows, my darling. And I endure like treatment. 
It’s the most delicious passion I know of; none surer to inflame 
my entire being. Nobody doubts nowadays but that passive flagel- 
lation is of prime efficacity; it is a matchless restorative, supplying 
new vitality to the frarae wearied by overindulgence. No wonder 
then that all those who have worn themselves to a frazzle in riot 
and sport have regular and avid recourse to the painful and invig- 
orating operation of flagellation, supreme remedy for exhaustion 
from feebleness about the loins or total loss of strength, or for a cold, 
vicious, and oddly organized constitution. This operation neces- 
sarily implies a violent commotion in the lax or deficient parts, it 


Juliette < 287 


procures a voluptuous irritation which heats them, and causes the 
sperm to leap with infinitely increased force: the keen sensation 
of pain in the parts upon which the blows are applied subtilizes the 
blood and accelerates its circulation, quickens the spirits by furnish- 
ing excessive heat to the genitals, in short, to the libidinous person 
in quest of pleasure provides, at such times as they are not naturally 
forthcoming, the means for consummating the libertine act, and 
for multiplying his impudicious joys beyond the limits imposed by 
that unkind Nature. As regards active flagellation, in all the world 
can there be a greater delight for hardhearted, tough-minded indi- 
viduals like us? Is there another that so clearly bears the stamp 
of ferocity, that, briefly, more fully satisfies our Nature-given pen- 
chant for cruelty? Oh, Juliette! to break in to this degradation 
some youthful object, appealing and mild and who when possible 
is somehow related to us, harshly to inflict upon her this form of 
torture, all the characteristics whereof are so emphatically volup- 
tuous, to be amused by her tears, excited by her distress, irritated 
by her capers, inflamed by her writhings, by that voluptuous danc- 
ing’ performed to the music of pain, to make her blood flow, her 
sweat, her tears, to feast upon them, upon her pretty face to mark 
and exult at contortions of sufferings and the twitching caused by 
despair, with one’s tongue to lap up those floods incarnadine so 
nicely contrasting with the lily fairness of a soft white skin, to feign 
to relent for an instant only to inspire terror the next by threats, to 
carry them out, and in doing so, to use yet more outrageous and 
more atrocious means, to spare nothing in your rage, to have at the 
most delicate parts, those very ones Nature seems to have created 
to be venerated by fools, such as the breasts or the interior of the 
vagina, such as the face itself—Oh, Juliette! that is joy. ’Tis it not, 
as it were, to encroach somewhat upon the public hangman’s do- 
main? is it not to play his role, and by itself does not this idea suffice 
to provoke an ejaculation with people who, unspeakably jaded as 
are we, indifferent to everything simple and commonplace, must 
study deeply and seek far if we are to find again that which our 
excesses have caused us to lose? Nor ought you be surprised to dis- 
cover this taste in a woman. That same Brantéme, from whom we

borrowed a term a moment ago, with charming candor and naiveteé 
offers us various examples in support of these theses.* There was, 
says he, a fashionable and distinguished lady, equally beautiful and 
rich; for several years sie had been a widow, and her moral cor- 
ruption was astonishing. She used to hold parties; to them she 
would invite girls of high social rank, and always of exceptional 
beauty, it was her pleasure to undress her guests and give them 
fierce spankings. To ob:ain the right to punish them she would 
accuse them of imaginary misbehavior; would then beat them with 
switches, and her whole joy consisted in seeing them quiver and 
squirm beneath the blows: the more they capered about, the louder 
their plaints, the more abundantly they bled and wept, the happier 
was the whore. Sometimes she was content to bare their behinds 
instead of stripping ther altogether naked, from the act of lifting 
their skirts and keeping them raised deriving yet more satisfaction 
than that afforded her when they were nude and hence easy prey. 

“A great nobleman, Brantéme tells us farther on, also in- 
dulged in this same pleasure of fustigating his wife, either nude or 
with her skirts pulled up. 

“A mother, the same writer assures us, had the habit of whip- 
ping her daughter twice every day, not for anything the girl had 
done, but uniquely for the pleasure of contemplating her suffer- 
ings. When the young thing reached the age of fourteen, she so 
inflamed her mother’s concupiscence that she wouldn’t let four hours 
go by without flogging her cruelly. Of contemporaries we have ex- 
amples enough, do we rot, and better ones at that; and could not 
your friend Saint-Fond, who never misses giving his daughter her 
daily lashing, serve as the subject for an entire corpus of modern 
research ?” 

“T’ve been the vict'm of that taste,” I observed, “but I rather 
fancy it nonetheless, and may well adopt it some day in my turn. 
Oh yes, Clairwil, I’ll acquire all your tastes, I wish if I possibly can

It would perhaps have been preferable had we extracted verbatim out of the author 
cited ; we have not done so for two reasons: of these, the first is that quotations always 


spoil the appearance of the printed page; the second, that Brantéme merely sketched 
what we have thought desirable to paint in all its colors, and in all its truth.

to become identical to you; henceforth Juliette shall know no happi- 
ness until she has taken on all your vices.” 

The four women made their entrance; they were naked in 
accordance with my friend’s desire, and as a group they surely 
presented a stirring sight to lewdness. The eldest was not quite 
eighteen, the youngest fifteen; there were lovely bodies and most 
agreeable faces. 

“They will do,” said Clairwil, glancing briefly at each. 

Each had a bundle of switches in her hand; these Clairwil 
examined rather more closely. 

“Very well, we shall proceed by order of age. Approach,” she 
said to the youngest, ‘‘come here and prostrate yourself at my feet. 
Now humbly beg pardon for your clumsy behavior yesterday.” 

“Clumsy behavior ? Madame, I don’t believe I—” 

And Clairwil gave her a resounding slap across the face. 

“T tell you you behaved clumsily. I order you to kneel and ask 
forgiveness.” 

“Oh indeed, Madame,” said the little girl, falling to her knees, 
“T ask it with all my heart.” 

“But I don’t intend to forgive you without first punishing 
you. Stand up and turn your ass obediently this way.” 

Thereupon, having softly stroked the pretty ass with the palm 
of her hand, Clairwil smote it so forcefully that she left there the 
impress of her five fingers; tears began to flow down the girl’s 
cheeks. The poor thing had had no forewarning of what was in 
store for her, she had never experienced anything like it, this recep- 
tion was affecting her dolorously. Clairwil peers at her and licks her 
eyes as soon as she sees the tears well forth; from her own eyes 
flames dart, her breathing quickens and becomes hoarse, her breasts 
heave in cadence with the beating of her heart. She stabs her tongue 
into the girl’s mouth, sucks her tongue, then, further animated by 
this caress, applies another blow to her ass, and this one is harder 
than the first. 

“You're a little slut,” says Clairwil. “I saw what you were 
doing yesterday, I did indeed: frigging pricks, and don’t deny it. 
I'll not have you committing such outrages. I favor morality, I do, 
I expect modesty in young girls.” 


”

““Madame, I swear co you—” 

“No swearing, whore, and no excuses either,” Clairwil inter- 
rupted, punching the girl’s flank; ‘guilty or not, you’re due to be 
vexed, for I aim to amuse myself. Wretched little creatures of your 
sort are no use whatever except for providing entertainment to 
women of mine.” 

So saying, Clairwil pinches the fleshier parts of the victim’s 
pretty body, this wrings shrieks from her, each of which gets no 
farther than her lips, for our libertine is there to collect them in her 
mouth. Her wrath grew apace, she gave utterance to the foulest 
words, they came forth spasmodically, like her gasps of joy; she 
bent her victim down over the couch, lubriciously investigated her 
bum, pried it open, thrust her tongue thereinto, then concentrated 
on her buttocks afresh, bit them in four places, the which the girl 
did not endure without much jerking to and fro and sudden starts 
that greatly diverted mv friend and made her laugh one of those 
wicked laughs wherein the mischief outweighs the gaiety. 

“Little bugger-fucker, you’re in for a thrashing,” says she, 
“yes, by the bum-stuffed Almighty, I’m going to flay you, and this 
cunning little shit-sump of yours is going to show every stripe for 
an age.” 

Catching up a bundle of switches, she pulls the girl to her feet, 
takes her around the. waist with her left arm, and thrusting a knee 
against her belly, bends 1er so that her ass is in the fairest position; 
Clairwil pauses for a minute, seems to reflect, to brood, then, with- 
out a word, begins to luy on and applies five and twenty stinging 
cuts so nicely distributed that every square inch of this formerly 
fresh pink ass is covered with welts. That done, she summons the 
other three women one after the other, has each stick her tongue in 
her mouth, ordering each to fondle her buttocks while embracing 
her, to tickle her asshole, to poke into it, to approve her punishment 
of the delinquent, and <.bove all to furnish additional information 
upon her misconduct. After she was finished with the three girls, 
my turn came, I kissed her in similar wise, socratized her, praised 
her firm handling of the victim, and by means of a string of arrant 
calumnies fanned her lubricious rage against the unfortunate crea- 
ture. When I kissed her, she wanted me to fill her mouth with my 
spittle, I did so, and she swallowed it; next, returning to work, she 


Juliette & 291 


laid on a second series of blows, twice as numerous as the first; 
then, immediately, a third series, bringing the total to one hundred 
and fifty strokes: the little girl’s ass was but one bleeding wound. 
She bade the three other women lick it and convey the blood into 
her mouth; and she kissed me, transferring that blood into mine. 

“Juliette,” said she, “the fever of delirium is taking fast hold 
of my senses; I must warn you that these other hussies are going 
to be more uncompromisingly dealt with.” 

She looses the little girl and from her receives a light tonguing 
about the cunt and anus. 

“Very well,” says she, pointing to the second, “I believe your 
age puts you next in line. Step up, whore.” 

The latter, terrified by what has just been done to her com- 
rade, instead of obeying, shrinks back. But Clairwil, who was in no 
merciful mood, seizes her by the arm and gives her several very 
violent slaps. She begins to weep. 

“Good,” says Clairwil. ““That’s what I like.” 

And since this charming creature, sixteen years of age, had 
prettily formed breasts already, Clairwil squeezed them until she 
screamed; then, kissing them the very next moment, she worried 
them with her teeth. 

“And now,” she said with a curse, “we'll have a look at your 
ass’; it proved very pleasing to Clairwil’s eye and she could not 
help but exclaim, before bringing them under the fire of her 
scourge, ‘‘what splendid cheeks!” 

Greatly impressed by their excellence, she rendered them new 
courtesies: she stooped forward, nuzzled that miracle of Nature, 
and sucked the hole; she rolled the girl onto her back, sucked her 
clitoris; then promptly returned again to her ass. But they are not 
slaps she now applies, they are jarring blows of her clenched fist 
she drives home, pounding this frail body until it is all black and 
blue from thigh to shoulder. 

“Bugger-fuck !”” cries she, “I’m going out of my mind! This 
little slattern has one of the loveliest asses I’ve seen in my life.” 

She seizes the switches and lays frantically on; but after a few 
score strokes she employs a tactic she has not used hitherto. Clairwil 
pries open the patient’s buttocks with her left hand, so that the 
blows she is delivering with her right hand fall upon the exposed 


292 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


asshole and the sensitive sector adjoining it; wherefore it is that the 
entire area is soon bloody. And while all this was going ahead 
Clairwil required kisses upon her mouth and fingers in her bum. 
The three other girls and I attended to these matters; however, 
she would allow no one |but me to swallow her saliva. The third 
girl was treated like the first, the fourth like the second; they were 
all flogged virtually to ribbons. When these ceremonies were over, 
Clairwil, in an ecstasy and as beautiful as Venus to behold, ranged 
the four girls in a line so as to compare their asses and verify 
whether they were all sufficiently lacerated. Finding that one had 
been somewhat neglected, she rained another fifty blows upon it, 
looked, and satisfied herself that it was presently in a state as 
deplorable as the others. 

“Juliette, do you wish me to thrash you too ?” 

“By all means, yes,” I answered at once. “How can you suspect 
me of not passionately desiring whatever adds to the sum of your 
delights ? Fie! Whip awav, here’s my ass, here’s my body, my whole 
being is yours to do with ¢s you like.” 

“In that case,” she said, ‘climb upon the shoulders of the 
youngest of these tarts and while I flog you the three others will 
heed my orders. Take uy) your switches,” she went on; ‘‘which of 
you has the stoutest arm? You'll be the last to operate, and you,” 
she said, nodding to the most slender of the three, ‘‘you shall be 
the first. So listen to me. This is what you are to do: You will 
kneel facing my ass, you will praise it loudly, unreservedly, you'll 
kiss it, you’ll divide my buttocks, will introduce your tongue far into 
the hole, while doing so rubbing my clitoris with one finger; then 
you will stand up, and to the tune of threats and invectives, you 
will bestow two hundred strokes upon my ass, they must come in 
swift succession and in steadily mounting force; and you over there, 
you've heard what I’ve just said: when this girl is done, you will 
promptly imitate the performance; we begin.” 

With nips, pinches, scratches, Clairwil was harrying the be- 
hind of the little girl upon whose shoulders I was perched, and in 
the meantime was flailin me in the most determined fashion; con- 
currently, the others were carrying out her instructions to the 
letter, and the whore, arxious to make use of everything available, 
was kissing the mouths of those who were not whipping her. As the 


Juliette %& 293 


stripes accumulated upon my ass the ferocious creature kissed and 
licked the marks avidly, and when she herself had received the 
number of strokes she had specified, she ordered positions to be 
shifted. 

The eighteen-year-old girl knelt in front of her; advancing 
her cunt, Clairwil pushed it into the girl’s face,. grinding the lips 
of her vagina and her clitoris against the girl’s nose, mouth, and 
eyes, and bidding her lick all her tongue could reach. Another girl 
stationed to the right, a third to the left, were vigorously scourg- 
ing my friend who, swinging a bundle of switches in either hand, 
was avenging herself upon the pair of asses ahead of her; squatting 
astride the head of the girl busy licking her cunt, I offered Clairwil 
mine to suck; and here the whore discharged. And that discharge, 
accompanied by shouts and shrieks, convulsions and blasphemies, 
was one of the most lubricious and most voluptuous frenzies I have 
ever observed in all my days; the tribade fired point-blank at the 
pretty visage fairly engulfed in her cunt, and drenched it with fuck. 

‘Come along, by Jesus, on to something else,” Clairwil cried, 
not so much as pausing for breath, “I never take time out when 
my sperm is started; so you whores, belabor me, rack me, suck me, 
whip me, frig me as hard as ever you can.” 

The girl of eighteen lies down upon the ottoman, I seat my- 
self upon her face, Clairwil camps herself on mine. I sucked, and 
was sucked; above me the youngest girl gave her buttocks to be 
kissed by Clairwil whom another girl was embuggering with a 
dildo; the slenderest of the quartet, bending over, was finger- 
frigging Clairwil’s clitoris, which was established hard by my 
mouth, and in the meantime was presenting her cunt to my friend 
whose hands were polluting it in similar style. So it was our liber- 
tine was simultaneously arousing an asshole by lecheries, having 
her anus tongued, being sodomized, and getting her clitoris teased. 

Several minutes of this had gone by when she said to me, 
‘Juliette, I told you that if I am to stiffen, I must be imaginatively 
moved; one of the things that best excites my imagination is to hear 
much foul language uttered all around me. Your whores, are they 
dumb ?” 

We were arrived at an awkward pass; for these girls, chosen 
out of the best ranks of the bourgeoisie, and never having been 


294 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


libertine except with me, had poor acquaintance with any idiom 
apt to be agreeable to Clairwil’s ears; they did the best they were 
able, however, but I was obliged to aid them, and virtually all 
alone had to supply the caustic insults she was pleased to hear 
addressed to the Supreme Being in whose existence the jade had no 
more belief than I. Consequently, she who had been clitoris-frigging 
replaced me at my cunt-sucking post; and I concentrated on vilify- 
ing each member of the scurvy Christian trinity as they had never 
been blasphemed in all their lives. The tribade squirmed and 
sighed incontinently, but nothing came of it, postures and episodes 
had to be changed once aguin. I have never seen anything so majestic, 
nor so beautiful, nor so animated as that superb woman at the 
conclusion of this scene; were you of a mind to paint the very 
goddess of lewd love, you could not have looked elsewhere for 
your model; she throws her arms about my neck, hugs me, tongues 
me for a quarter of an hour, exhibits her ass to me; it was scarlet 
all over and contrasted in the most agreeable manner with the 
alabaster whiteness of the rest of her body. 

“Thrice bum-stuffed, holy God of buggery,” said she, over- 
wrought, ‘how hot I am in the cunt, Juliette, and what things I 
could achieve in this state; there’s not a crime of whatever sort or 
extent you can imagine I’d not commit on the spot. Oh, my love— 
oh, my whore—oh, my dearest little companion . . . oh, thou whom 
I love infinitely and in whose embrace I want to shed a lifetime’s 
fuck, oh, Juliette, you must admit that nothing paves a surer or 
a smoother way to horror than the calm self-confidence, impunity, 
capital, and good health we enjoy; so suggest to me the idea for a 
few crimes... I'll accomplish them while you look on. .. . Let’s, 
oh, I beseech you, let’s perpetrate an infamy... .” 

Noticing that the youngest of the girls was arousing her and 
that she was going from her mouth to her ass to her cunt, sucking 
them one after the other, I inquired in a whisper, “Would you 
care to abuse her ?” 

“No,” was her reply, “it wouldn’t satisfy me; I’ve nothing 
against giving a woman 2n occasional pummeling, but as for total 
material dissolution, you understand . . . I’d have to have a man. 
Only men rouse me to serious cruelties; I adore revenging my sex 
for the horrors men subject us to when those brutes have the upper 


Jalictte & 295 


hand. You can’t imagine with what delight I’d now murder a male. 
Any male at all. My God, the tortures I’d inflict upon him; the 
slow, winding, obscure path I'd find to bring him to his final destina- 
tion. . . . Alack, ’tis plain to see, your mind has yet to reach full 
flower, you haven’t any men about for me to kill; and so let’s end 
the evening with a few exercises in libidinous nastiness since we 
cannot close it with crimes.” 

The libidinous acts, performed with great precision and all 
the desired conclusions, finally exhaust her; she refreshes herself 
in a bath of rose water, is dried, perfumed, draped in the most im- 
modest of gowns; and we sit down to supper. 

Clairwil, quite as eccentric in her comportment at table as in 
bed, quite as intemperate, no less curious in the article of eating 
than in the other of fucking, fed only on fowl and game, and they 
had to be boned and then served up disguised in all sorts of forms; 
her usual drink was sweetened water and it had to be iced regard- 
less of the season, and to every pint of this liquid she added twenvy 
drops of essence of lemon and two spoonfuls of orange flower ex- 
tract; she never touched wine, but consumed large amounts of 
coffee and liqueurs; she ate in excessive quantity; furthermore, of 
the better than fifty dishes put before her she attacked every one. 
Advised beforehand of her tastes, I saw to it that her desires 
were accommodated, and it defies belief, the tale of all she made 
away with. That charming person, whose custom was whenever 
and wherever possible to secure the adoption of her private 
tastes, recommended them to me so heartily that she induced me to 
observe her diet, but not her abstinence from wine; I still indulge 
very heavily in it and shall doubtless continue to do so for the rest 
of my life. 

While we were supping I confessed to Clairwil my amazement 
at her libertinage. 

“You haven’t seen much yet,” she replied, “little beyond a 
faint sketch of what I regularly accomplish in lewd debauchery. 
I am most eager that we essay truly extraordinary things together; 
I shall have you admitted into a society I belong to, and whose 
members specialize in obscenities of a much superior dimension. To 
its meetings each husband must bring his wife, each brother his 
sister, each father his daughter, each bachelor a friend, each lover

his mistress; and gathered in a spacious hall each takes his pleasure 
with what pleases him most, subject to no rule save that of his 
desires, to no limit save that of his imagination; the most praise- 
worthy is he who acquits himself of the greatest and most numerous 
extravagances, and cash prizes are awarded to those who dis- 
tinguish themselves in infamy or who invent new ways and means 
for procuring oneself pleasure.” 

“Oh, dearest friend,” I cried, taking Clairwil in my arms, 
“you simply have no idea how those few details excite me, nor 
how happy I would be to~ oin your circle.” 

“Yes, but will you be considered eligible ? Candidates are sub- 
mitted to the most arduouis tests.” 

“Do you doubt of, my capacity, of my determination? And 
whatever these initiations may be, do you suppose I will flinch, 
knowing as you do all that I have performed intrepidly in the com- 
pany of Noirceuil and Saint-Fond?” 

“True enough,” sh: conceded, “‘you’re not shy, it must be 
owned. Your chances of being admitted are better than fair.” Then 
a note of enthusiasm entered her voice. “Oh, Juliette, as it is always 
to the disgust, to the restlessness, to the despair at not ever having 
found either a mutual understanding or mutual pleasure with the 
object to which we are conventionally bound that are owing all of 
wedlock’s miseries, to remedy this hideous situation, to counteract 
the hideous social practices whereby mismatched individuals are 
imprisoned all their lives in nightmarish unions, it would be neces- 
sary that all men and all women federate into such clubs. A hun- 
dred husbands, a hundred fathers, corporatively with their wives 
or daughters, are availec. thereby of all they lack. When I cede my 
husband to Climéne, she obtains everything her own husband 
cannot give her and from the one she abandons to me, I derive all 
the delights mine is incapable of providing me. These exchanges 
multiply and thus, you see, in a single evening every woman enjoys 
a hundred men, each man as many women; in the course of these 
forgatherings characters develop; one has an opportunity to study 
oneself; the most entire freedom of taste or fancy holds sway 
there: the man who dislikes women amuses himself with his fellows, 
the woman who is fond of persons of her own sex simply follows 
the dictates of her penchants also; no constraint, no hindrances, no

modesty, the mere desire to increase one’s pleasures ensures that 
each will offer all his resources. Thereupon the general interest 
maintains the pact, and particular interest coincides straitly with 
the general, which renders indissoluble the ties forming the society : 
ours has been fifteen years in existence, and all that time I have 
never witnessed a single squabble, no, not one instance of ill-humor. 
Such arrangements annihilate jealousy, forever destroy the fear of 
cuckoldry, two of life’s most pernicious poisons, and for that reason 
alone merit preference over those monotonous partnerships in 
which husband and wife, pining their lives away one in the presence 
of the other, are doomed either to everlasting boredom and dis- 
pleasure, or to grief at being unable to dissolve their marriage 
save at the price of dishonor for them both. May our example 
persuade mankind to do as we. There are, I am aware, some preju- 
dices to overcorr >; but prejudice cannot long survive when one 
of these groups, as is the case with ours, is injected with a strong 
philosophical temper. It was during my first year of marriage I was 
granted membership, I was just sixteen then. Oh yes, making my 
debut, I confess I did indeed blush at having to appear naked before 
all those men and to participate in their carryings-on and in those 
of the women who, because of my age and figure, were drawn to 
me like flies to sugar; but in three days I was acquitting myself like 
a veteran. The example of the others seduced me; and I can honestly 
affirm that no sooner did I see my lascivious companions vying for 
honors in the choice and the invention of lubricities, no sooner did 
I see them wallowing in filth and infamy, than I plunged into the 
competition with ardent good will and shortly surpassed them all 
in theory and practice alike.” 

The description of this delicious association had such an effect 
upon me that I was unwilling to take leave of Clairwil until she had 
sworn to secure my entrance into her club. The oath was sealed with 
fresh outpourings of fuck we both released before the eyes of three 
strapping lackeys: they held candelabras while we frigged each 
other, and though they were moved by the spectacle, Clairwil for- 
bade them from participating in it save as bystanders. 

“There you have an instance,” said she, ‘‘of how one accustoms 
oneself to cynicism, a habit of mind whereof proof will be required 
of you before you are accepted into our society.” 


298 le THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


We separated, enchanted with each other and promising to 
meet together again at the very first opportunity. 

Noirceuil was impatient to find out how my liaison with 
Madame de Clairwil was progressing; the warmth wherewith I 
spoke of her translated my gratitude. He wanted graphic particu- 
lars, I supplied them; and, as Clairwil had done, he criticized me 
for not having a more numerous complement of women in my 
household. I increased them by eight the very next day, which gave 
me a seraglio of twelve of the prettiest creatures in Paris; I ex- 
changed them against a dozen fresh ones every month. 

I mentioned the society Clairwil belonged to; did Noirceuil 
attend its meetings ? 

“In the days when men were in the majority there,” he replied, 
“I never missed a single one; but I have given up going since every- 
thing has fallen into the hands of a sex whose authority I dislike. 
Saint-Fond felt the same way and dropped out shortly after I did. 
But that is not particularly relevant,” Noirceuil continued; “if those 
orgies amuse you, and since Clairwil enjoys them, there is no reason 
why you shouldn’t join in: everything vicious must be given a fair 
try, and only virtue is thoroughly boring. At those meetings you 
will be frigged to perfection, exquisitely fucked; you’ll be nourished 
upon the very best principles only; and so I would advise you to 
gain admission as soon as you possibly can.” Then he inquired if 
my new friend had recounted her adventures to me in detail. 

“No,” said I. 

“Philosophical in spirit though you are, and the fact cannot 
have escaped her notice,” Noirceuil remarked, ‘she probably 
feared lest you be scandzlized. For that Clairwil is a very paragon 
of lust, cruelty, debauchery, and atheism; there is no horror, no 
execration wherewith sie is not soiled profoundly; her social 
position and boundless wealth have always saved her from the 
rope, but she’s merited it twenty times over: reckon up the sum of 
her daily activities and there you have the total of her crimes, and 
had she been hanged every day of her life it would never have been 
without cause. Saint-Fond thinks very highly of her; nonetheless, 
and this I know, he prefers you for a number of reasons: therefore, 
Juliette, continue to be deserving of the confidence of a man in 
whose power it is to make your life a happy one, or an unhappy.” 


Juliette 2 299 


“Rest assured,” I rejoined, ‘‘all my efforts shall be bent in 
that direction.” Noirceuil had come to fetch me for supper at his 
little house, and we betook ourselves there and spent the night 
carousing with two other engaging persons, executing all the ex- 
travagances that occurred to that specialist in lubricious practices. 

It was shortly afterward that, mightily stirred by what I had 
been witness to, by the things I had been hearing, I reached the 
point where I simply could not restrain myself any longer, I had 
absolutely to commit a crime of my own; and I was eager to learn, 
moreover, whether I could truly rely upon the impunity that had 
been promised me. So I took counsel with myself, and decided to 
enact one such horror as I was being schooled in day in and day out. 
Wishing to put both my daring and my savagery to the test, I got 
into man’s attire and, a brace of pistols in my pocket, went out 
alone, stood in a back street, and waited for the first comer, with 
the aim of robbing and murdering him for my pleasure. I was 
leaning against the wall; I was in that state of inner turmoil great 
passions provoke, and whose impact upon the animal spirits is 
necessary to the elementary criminal delight. I listened, asweat. 
Every murmur, every footfall raised my hopes. The very faintest 
movement in the shadows made me think my prey was nigh; and 
then I heard sounds of lamentation. I sped in the direction whence 
they came, they were groans; I approach, ’tis a poor woman huddled 
upon a doorstep. 

“And who are you?” I inquired, drawing close to the creature. 

“The most unfortunate of women,” is her tearful reply; and 
I observe that she cannot be over thirty years of age; “‘and if you 
are death’s messenger, you bring me glad tidings.” 

‘‘But your difficulties are of precisely what kind ?” 

“They are frightful,” she said, and as she sat up, the lamp- 
light revealed her mild inviting features. “Yes, few have ever been 
so unlucky as I. We’ve had no work for a week, no money, we had 
a room in this building, we weren't able to pay the rent, nor able 
either to buy milk for the baby—they’ve taken it away from me and 
put my husband in jail. I too would have been arrested had I not 
run away from those monsters who treated us so brutally. You see 
me lying on the threshold of a house that belonged to me once, for 
I have not always been poor. In those days, when I could afford to, 


300 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


I helped the needy; will you do for me now what I used to do 
for them? I do not ask much.” 

A subtle glow stole through my veins as J heard those words, 
savored that accent. Oh, by God, I said to myself, what an occasion 
for a delectable crime, and how the idea stung my senses. 

‘Get up,” said I. “[’m a man as you can see. You have a body 
left to you, don’t you? I intend to amuse myself with it.” 

“Oh, Sir! Here am I beset by sorrow and distress—can such 
a state kindle lust ?”’ 

‘It kindles mine all right; so do as I tell you, else you'll regret 
it.” 

And taking strong hold of her arm, I forced her to stand still 
while I proceeded to an investigation. It brought agreeable things to 
light, those skirts harbored charms very fair, very firm, very ap- 
petizing. 

“Frig me,” I ordered, conveying her hand to my cunt, “I am 
a woman, but one who stiffens for her own sex. Put your fingers in 
there and rub.” 

“Oh, Lord! Leave me be, leave me be, I shudder at all these 
horrors, Though poor, I am honest; don’t humiliate me, for pity’s 
sake!” 

She endeavors to break away from me, I seize her by the hair, 
raise a pistol to her temple: ‘Be off, buggeress,” I say, “‘off to hell 
with you, and tell them there that Juliette sent you.” 

And she fell, blooc! gushing from her head. Yes, my friends, I 
shot her dead, I won’t cleny it, neither will I pretend that this deed 
did not cause a sudden rise in the temperature of my neural 
humours, for, as I enacted it, my fuck fairly spat forth. 

And so these are the fruits of crime, I mused, how right they 
were to describe it tc’ me in such glowing terms. God! what 
sovereign influence it can exert upon a brain like mine, and what 
gigantic pleasures it cai afford! 

Hearing the pisto]-shot, people had come to their windows; I 
saw a few heads and now began to think of my safety. Cries of 
“Police, police!” went up on all sides. It was just after midnight, I 
was hailed, ordered to halt; the discovery of my weapons elimi- 
nated all doubt; I was asked my name. 


Juliette & 301 


“You'll be informed at the Minister’s,” I said brazenly. “Take 
me to the Hotel de Saint-Fond.” 

Dumbfounded, the sergeant does not dare refuse; I am 
manacled, I am pinioned . . . and still the fuck seeps down my 
thighs: delicious are the fetters of the crime you adore, and wearing 
them causes one long spasm of joy. 

Saint-Fond had not yet retired; a servant notified him, I was 
led in, the Minister greeted me with a smile. 

‘That will do,” he said to the sergeant; “had you not brought 
this lady here to my house you were as good as hanged. You may 
go now, sir, and resume your functions, consider that you have 
done your duty. What has just transpired shall remain a mystery. 
You are not to intrude into it; I presume I need say no more.” 

Alone with my lover, I related all that had passed, my ac- 
count set his prick in the air; he wished to know when the woman 
had fallen to the ground, had I been able to appreciate the effects of 
her contortions ? 

I answered that I had not had enough time. 

“No, I suppose not. That’s the trouble with performances 
of that sort, you aren’t able to obtain any enjoyment from the 
victim.” 

“To be sure, my Lord—but a street crime—” 

“I know, I know, I’ve a few of them to my credit—disturbance 
of the peace, scandal, the street . . . the highway—the additional 
severity of the law toward such offenses; and they can be profitable 
as well. ..on top of it all, that particular woman’s circumstances, 
her indigence, her misery. . . . No, it’s not to be scoffed at. You 
could have taken her home with you, it would have been an even- 
ing’s entertainment for us both, . . . By the way, did not that 
sergeant mention having identified the corpse?” 

“Unless I am mistaken, my Lord, her name was Simon.” 

“Simon. Of course. I handled that affair four or five days ago. 
That’s it, Simon. I had the husband jailed and the infant removed 
to the poorhouse. My stars, Juliette, I remember the woman too: 
she was very pretty and very well-behaved. I was reserving her for 
your pimps; and she told you the truth, that family was once quite 
prosperous, bankruptcy altered all that. Well, you’ve simply added 


302 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the finishing touches to my crime, and this conclusion makes the 
story delicious from beginning to end.” 

I said Saint-Fond’s standard was raised, my masculine dress 
was completing his delirium. He led me into the boudoir where he 
had received me the first time I had come to his house. A man- 
servant appeared, and Saint-Fond, his fingers trembling from de- 
light, unbuttoned my breeches and had his valet fondle my 
buttocks; he took charge of the fellow’s prick and prodded my ass- 
hole with its tip, then introduced his own thereinto; and the lecher 
embuggered me, hotly enjoining me to suck his valet’s prick the 
while, and when I'd got t stiff as a poker he packed it away in his 
ass. The operation over with, Saint-Fond told me that the excellence 
of his discharge was in large measure due to the knowledge that the 
ass he was fucking merited the scaffold. 

“That lad who fucked me,”’ the Minister assured me, “‘is a 
rascal of the first order: six times over I’ve had to save him from 
the wheel. Did you notice his prick? ’Tis a magnificent article, he 
plies it masterfully. Here, Juliette, before I forget: the sum I 
promised you for crimes of your personal commission. A carriage 
is waiting for you, go home now, tomorrow you will leave for the 
estate outside Sceaux which I bought for you last month; take only 
a few companions alon;z, four of your female domestics should 
sufice—the prettiest of the lot, however—your cook too, your 
butler, and the three virgins listed for the next supper. Installed in 
the country, you'll await further instructions from me; that’s all 
I'll tell you for the time being.” 

I left very content with the success of my crime, full of pleas- 
ure at having committed it; and departed from Paris on the 
morrow. 

Scarcely was I established in that rural domain, completely 
isolated, as solitary as the Thebaid hermits, when there came one 
of my servants to inform me a stranger had arrived, a person of 
condition who said he had been sent by the Minister and wished 
to speak with me. 

‘“‘Ask him to wait,’ said I, and unsealed the message he had 
brought from Saint-Fon4d. It read as follows: ‘‘Have your domestics 
seize the bearer of this letter straightway, he is to be confined in 
one of the dungeons I have caused to be built in the cellars of your 


Juliette & 303 


house. This individual is not to be allowed to escape; I hold you 
responsible for him. His wife and daughter will also appear: you 
will deal with them in the same manner. These are my orders. 
Execute them promptly, scrupulously, and do not hesitate to employ 
such treachery, such cruelty, as I know you to be capable of. Adieu.” 
I had the stranger ushered in. 

“Sir,” said I, maintaining the appearance of perfect equanim- 
ity and graciousness, “‘you are doubtless a friend of his Lordship?” 

“Both my family and I have for a long time been the bene- 
ficiaries of his generosities and kindness, Madame.” 

“Tis plain from his letter, Monsieur. . . . But allow me to 
give my servants instructions so that you may be received in such 
wise as the Minister seems to desire.” 

Bidding him be seated, I went out of the room. 

My servants, and they were rather more slaves than domestics, 
provided themselves with rope and were at my side when I returned 
to the visitor. 

“Conduct this gentleman,” | told them, ‘‘to the quarters his 
Lordship would have him occupy,” and my retainers, powerful 
bucks they were, set upon our guest and dragged him off to a very 
abominable cell far under ground. 

‘Madame! I protest! There is some mistake!” cried the 
unlucky dupe of Saint-Fond’s deceit and mine. 

Inflexible, deaf to his pleadings, I carried out the Minister’s 
instructions with zeal: the captive’s anguished questions were left 
all unanswered, I myself turned the key in the lock. 

No sooner was I back in the drawing room than I heard 
carriage wheels on the drive. Out stepped the stranger’s wife and 
daughter, and the letters of introduction they presented were exact 
replicas of his. 

Ah, Saint-Fond, I said to myself, casting a glance upon those 
two women, admiring the beauty of the mother who was a superb 
thirty-six, the sweet modesty and grace of the daughter, only then 
entering her sixteenth year, ah, Saint-Fond! your fell, accursed lust 
has much to do with these ministerial proceedings, that is but too 
certain. And in this, as in everything else you do, are you not 
guided far more by your vices than by the interests of your country ? 

I would be hard pressed to give an adequate description of the 


304 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


moans and tears those two wretches let forth when they beheld 
themselves dragged infamously off to the dungeons readied for 
them ; but no more moved by the weeping and wailing of the mother 
and daughter than I had been by the entreaties of the father, I 
was concerned only to take the greatest precautions for their safe- 
keeping, and was not at ease until I had these important prisoners 
behind the stoutest bars ind all the keys in my pocket. 

Meditating upon what the fate of these individuals might be, 
I did not imagine that it would involve more than detention, in as 
much as executions were my affair and I had received no instruc- 
tions to slay; while I was in the middle of pondering these matters, 
the arrival of a fourth personage was announced to me. Heavens, 
what is my surprise upon recognizing the selfsame young man who, 
you will recall, the first time I held conversation with Saint-Fond, 
at the latter’s bidding struck me three blows of a cane upon the 
shoulders. He too came bearing a letter, I opened it at once. 

“Greet this man warmly and entertain him well,” I read; “you 
must surely remember hm, for you carried his marks awhile, and 
they were his hands that gripped you at our first voluptuous 
rencounter in your house. He is to take the leading role in the 
drama that will be staged tomorrow; in him welcome the execu- 
tioner of Nantes, who upon my orders has come to put to death the 
three persons now your prisoners : obliged under pain of losing my 
post to produce these three heads the day after tomorrow before 
the Queen, I would mysclf (needless to say) wield the ax, had not 
Her Majesty expressed the very keenest desire to receive the spoils 
out of none other than the hands of a public executioner. It is for 
that reason the latter, arriving in Paris, found his services not 
immediately required there, and has been dispatched posthaste to 
your residence, whither le comes in ignorance of the business he is 
to attend to. You may instruct him now; but refrain absolutely from 
permitting him a glimpse of his prey, this is essential; expect me 
tomorrow morning. Meanwhile treat the prisoners, and the women 
especially, very rigorously: bread only, a little water, and no day- 
light.” 

“Sir,” said I, turning to the most recent of my visitors, “the 
Minister mentions in his letter that we, you and I, are not unknown 
to each other. ’Tis true. Once upon a time you—” 


Juliette 2 305 


““Aye, Madame. Orders, alas, are orders.” 

“Indeed they are, and I harbor no grudge against you,” I 
went on, giving him my hand, which he kissed with ardor. “But it is 
dinner-time. First to table; we’ll discuss afterward.” 

Delcour was twenty-eight, a very pretty fellow, his air and 
calling pleased me mightily. I showered attentions upon him, and 
they were quite sincere; when we finished dinner, I mounted as 
skillful an attack as ever you've seen. Delcour soon exhibited 
evidence of the success of my advances. There was a wonderful 
bulge in his breeches, I was overpowered. 

“For God’s sake, my love,” said I, “have it out, I fain must 
see what you're hiding there. That magnificent prick has me all 
aflutter, your profession sets my brain awhirl; you've absolutely 
got to fuck me.” 

He promptly fetches that marvelous device into view, and 
pursuant to my custom when dealing with a man, I catch hold of it 
with the intention of mouthing it to the balls; but that was a 
grandly proportioned tool, I tell you, and it was all I could do to 
accommodate half its length. As soon as he was lodged, Delcour 
got his hands on my cunt, buried his face in it, and two seconds later 
we discharged in concert. Seeing me swallow his fuck, that hand- 
some young man leapt excitedly upon me. 

“Ah, by Jesus,” said he, “I was in too great a hurry; but I'll 
make amends for my mistake.” 

The rascal’s stave was still holding true, he stretches me out 
upon a broad couch, fastens his lips to mine which are yet sticky 
with his sperm, and encunts me as only rarely you will be encunted 
by a still leaking prick: in all my life I’d never been so stoutly 
fucked. Delcour cut and thrust for three-quarters of an hour and 
more, out of prudence he retreated on sensing another discharge 
impending; but when at last my cunt’s grip triumphed, he loosed a 
second dose of thick fuck, and this too I swallowed with as much 
delight as I had the first. 

“Delcour,” said I, once I had resumed possession of my wits 
and could essay a rational analysis of my late behavior, “you have 
been somewhat surprised, I fancy, by the informal reception I have 
given you; such frivolous conduct, such speedy advances—I venture 
to suppose you consider me a loose woman, nay, a thorough whore. 


306 -% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Despite: my supreme disdain for that which fools call reputation, I 
would have you understand that your good fortune is owing far 
less to my coquetry or to anything physical in me than to my 
mentality: I have an exceptionally odd one. You kill by trade... 
you are a murderer, a handsome one besides, one such prick as you 
boast isn’t come by every day. But your profession, it is that I wish 
to stress—thanks alone to it I flung myself into your arms; scorn 
me, detest me, I don’t give a damn. You fucked me; I’ve got all I 
wanted.” 

“Heavenly creature,” Delcour replied, “it isn’t scorn I feel 
for you, no, nor shall it be hatred, you inspire altogether different 
sentiments in me. You cleserve to be worshiped and worship you I 
shall, regretting that your ecstasy had its origin solely in that which 
earns me the loathing os others.” 

“Tis of no importance, that,” said I. ““A mere matter of 
opinion, and opinion varies, as you observe, since the source of my 
fondness for you is precisely this very thing which puts you at a 
remove from the rest of mankind; however, this is but debauchery 
on my part, you shouldn’t interpret it as anything else. My attach- 
ment to the Minister, ny manner of living with him bar me from 
intrigues and I'll certainly never contemplate any. We'll make the 
most of this evening, of the whole night if you like; and there’s an 
end to it.” 

“Ah, Madame,” the young man said with respectfulness, ‘‘of 
you I ask only your protection and your gracious kindness.” 

“You shall never want for either; but in return you must 
comply with all that results from my imagination. I must warn you, 
it is subject to all sorts of disorders, and they sometimes lead far.” 

Delcour had gone back to fondling my breasts with one hand 
and frigging my clitoris. with the other, now and again darting his 
tongue down my gullet; after a few minutes of this I bade him 
refrain from wearying himself unduly, and to give truthful answers 
to certain questions I wished to pose him. 

“Tell me, to begin with, just why Saint-Fond had you strike 
me upon the shoulder that first time I saw you. It puzzled me then 
and still does.” 

“Libertinage, Madame, sheer libertinage. You know the Min- 
ister. He has his quirks.” 


Juliette % 307 


“He has you take part in luxurious scenes then ?” 

“Whenever I am in Paris.” 

“He has fucked you?” 

“He has, Madame.” 

“And you’ve fucked him back ?” 

“Most certainly.” 

“You have beaten him? Flogged him?” 

“Frequently.” 

“Sweet Jesusfuck! how that excites me—frig, Delcour, frig 
away—and has he had you beat and flog other women?” 

“Upon several occasions.” 

“Have you ever gone farther ?” 

“Allow me to respect the Minister’s secrets, Madame. In this 
connection your guesses are very apt to be correct since they would 
be based on a good acquaintance of his Lordship.” 

“Can you say whether he has at any time formulated projects 
against me?” 

“Madame, toward you his attitude has always been, to my 
knowledge, one of affection and trust; he is greatly attached to 
you, you may take my word for it.” 

“And so am I to him: I adore him, I hope he is fully aware 
of it. However, since you would not have me tempt you to indiscre- 
tion, we'll talk of other things. Tell me, if you please, how are you 
able to take the life of some individual who has never wronged you 
in any way? How is it that from the depths of your soul pity does 
not speak out in behalf of the poor wretches the law enjoins you 
to assassinate in cold blood?” 

“Be very certain, Madame,” was Delcour’s answer, “that in 
my calling none of us attains this degree of rationalized and scien- 
tific ferocity save through principles that are largely unknown to 
folk in general.” 

“How so? Principles? I would have you tell me about them.” 

“They are rooted in a soil of total inhumanity; our training 
begins early, from childhood on we are taught a system of values 
wherein human life is nothing and the law everything; the result 
is that it gives us no more bother to cut the throats of our fellows 
than it does a butcher to cut the throat of a calf. Does the butcher 
have qualms? He doesn’t know what they are. Neither do we.” 


308 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘But carrying out the law is your work; do you proceed in the 
same way when it is a question of pleasure ?” 

“Certainly, Madame. Could it be otherwise? Should it be? 
The prejudice once overcome in us, we cease to behold any evil in 
murder.” 

‘‘Must one not necessarily esteem it an evil to destroy one’s 
fellow beings ?” 

‘Madame, I might rather ask you how one can possibly im- 
pute any such thing to an act of destruction. If destruction of all 
human beings were not one of the fundamental laws of Nature, 
then, yes, I should be able to believe that you outrage this unin- 
telligible Nature when you destroy; but in view of the fact there 
does not exist a single natural process which does not prove that de- 
struction is a necessary element to the natural order and that 
Nature creates only by int of destroying, ’tis most obvious that 
whoever destroys acts‘in tune with Nature. It is no less obvious 
that whoever refuses to destroy offends Nature very grievously: 
for, and of this there can be no doubt, it is only by destroying we 
furnish Nature the means for creating; and hence the more we 
destroy, the nicer the accord between ourselves and her workings; 
if murder is basic to Nature’s regenerative operations, certainly the 
murderer is the man who serves Nature best; and this truth grasped, 
we are moved to declare: that the more numerous his murders, the 
better he fulfills his obligations toward a Nature whose sole need 
is of murders.””® 

“Such doctrines contain their element of peril.” 

“They are nonetheless true, Madame. More learned thinkers 
would be able to develop them much further than can I, but you will 
find that the point of ceparture of their arguments is constantly 
the same.” 

“My friend,” I said to Delcour, “you have already given me 
much food for thought, a single idea cast into a brain like mine 
produces the effect there of a spark upon saltpeter—yes, I sense 
it, we have similar minds. We have three victims here. To sacrifice 
them is why you were sent to this chateau. It will, believe me, give

me great pleasure to behold you in action; but, my dear, you must 
possess a vast store of information and experience, be so kind as to 
dilate upon the mechanics of the thing. Am I correct in believing 
that it is only with the aid of libertinage you succeed in vanquish- 
ing unnatural prejudice? For you just gave me clear proof that 
Nature is much sooner served than outraged by murder. . . .” 

“What do you wish to ask, Madame?” 

“This : if it is not very certain, as I have heard say, that only 
by transforming the whole affair into one of libertinage are you 
able to perform, and enjoy, the murders your trade obliges you to 
commit; in fine, I ask you if ’tis not so, that the act of executing 
infallibly puts your prick erect?” 

“It is no longer contested, Madame, that libertinage leads 
logically to murder; and all the world knows that the pleasure-worn 
individual must regain his strength in this manner of committing 
what fools are disposed to denominate a crime: we subject some 
person or other to the maximum agitation, its repercussion upon 
our nerves is the most potent stimulant imaginable, and to us are 
restored all the energies we have previously spent in excess. Murder 
thus qualifies as the most delicious of libertinage’s vehicles, and as 
the surest; but it is not true that in order to commit murder, one 
has got to be mentally in a libertine furor. By way of proof I cite 
to you the extreme calm wherewith the majority of my colleagues 
dispatch their business; they experience emotion, yes, but it is 
quite as different from the passion animating the libertine as this 
latter is from the passion in him who murders out of ambition, or 
out of vengeance, or out of greed, or, again, out of sheer cruelty. 
Which is simply to indicate that there are several classes of murder, 
the libertine variety being but one; however, this does not prevent 
us from concluding that none of these sorts of murder outrages 
Nature, and that it is in far greater conformance to her laws than 
in violation thereof.” 

“All you say is just, Delcour, but J maintain nonetheless that, 
precisely in the interest of these very murders, it would be desirable 
were their perpetrator to be inspired by lust alone, for that passion 
is never followed by remorseful aftermaths, one’s recollections of 
it are of joy and joyous; whereas with the others, once their fire 
has gone out one is often devoured by regrets, above all if one 


310 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


happens to be something less than a veteran philosopher; and 
therefore it seems to me there is much to be said in favor of never 
murdering save through libertinage. One would be free to kill for 
whatever the motive, but the erection would always be there as a 
safeguard and the better to consolidate the action, so as to avoid 
being troubled by serious remorse later on.” 

“In that case,” said Delcour, “you consider that every passion 
can be increased or nourished by lust ?” 

“Lust is to the passions what the nervous fluid is to life: it 
sustains them all, it supplies strength to them all, and the proof 
thereof is that a man who, as they say, hasn’t any balls will never 
have any passions.” 

‘And so you suppose that ambition, cruelty, greed, vindictive- 
ness as motivations lead to the same thing as lust ?” 

“Yes, I am convinced that all these passions cause erections, 
and that a lively and properly organized mind will be as readily 
inflamed by any of them as by lust. Mark you, I am speaking now 
from personal experienc. The effect of concentrating upon mental 
images characterized by ambition, cruelty, avarice, revenge has 
been that of a thorough frigging, and each of these ideas has more 
than once made me discharge myself dry. I have not entertained the 
thought of a single crime, whatever the passion inspiring it, without 
feeling the subtle heat of lust circulate in my veins: falsehood, 
impiety, calumny, rasca.ity, hardheartedness, even gluttony have 
wrought those effects in me; and, in a word, there is not one form 
or mode of viciousness which has failed to ignite my lust; or, if you 
prefer, the torch of lust has at one time or another made all the 
vices in me blaze up with its sacred fire, to them all communicating 
that voluptuous sensation which, it appears, is never kindled other- 
wise in us curiously organized persons. There. That is my opinion.” 

‘And it is mine also, Madame,” Delcour rejoined, “I'll not . 
attempt to conceal it any longer.” 

“T rejoice at your f:-ankness, my dear, it helps me to know you. 
And from what I know of you already, I venture to say, and would 
be greatly surprised if I was in error here, that you require to enter 
into a libertine furor when you perform your official murders, which 
enables you to reap far more voluptuous satisfaction from your 


Juliette & 311 


functions than is granted your colleages who carry them out 
mechanically.” 

‘‘Madame, I must own that you have fairly found me out.” 

“Scoundrel,” I said, smiling and taking hold of this young 
man’s tool, which I began to exercise so as to restore some of its 
energy, ‘‘oh, deep-dyed libertine that you are, why not go on to say 
that your prick hardens for the sake of the enjoyment to be had 
from my existence today, and tomorrow depriving me of it would 
make you discharge ?” 

The young man was visibly embarrassed at this last question; 
I gazed at him for a moment, then came to his rescue. ‘‘There, 
there, my friend; I have absolutely no quarrel with your principles, 
I must forgive you their results: instead of disputing about those 
results, let’s profit from them.” At this point I grew very hot 
indeed. “Come now, look alive, we must try some extraordinary 
tricks.” 

‘What would you have me do?” 

“Beat me, outrage me, lash me; isn’t that what you do with 
women every day; aren't those the foul violences which, electrifying 
you, make you capable of the rest ? Well ? Answer.” 

“Tis true.” 

“Of course. Well, you’ve a job to perform tomorrow, start 
preparing for it today. There is my body. It is at your disposal.” 

And Delcour, following my instructions, having started in with 
a dozen slaps and kicks in the behind, took up a bundle of withes 
and slashed away at my ass for fifteen minutes or so, while one of 
my women cunt-sucked me. 

“Delcour,” I cried. “Oh, divine destroyer of the human race! 
you whom I adore and from whom I expect unheard-of joys, lay on, 
lay on, I say, whip your slut harder, faster, imprint the marks of 
your savagery upon her, for she yearns to wear them. I discharge at 
the idea of my blood wetting your fingers; shed it liberally, my 
love... .” 

It flowed. .. . Oh, my friends, I was in ecstasies; words cannot 
express the wild emotion that was cindering me; without a brain 
like mine there is no conceiving such a thing, unless one has brains 
like yours it is not to be comprehended. Unlimited were the quanti- 


312 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ties of fuck I loosed into the mouth of my fricatrice; never in my 
life had I been in the throes of such disorder, such torment, such 
rapture. 

“Delcour, Delcour,” I went on, “there is one last homage yeu 
must render me, husband your resources for the purpose. This ass 
you've just hacked to ribbons beckons you, invites you to soothe, to 
console it. At Cythera Venus had more than one temple, you know; 
come ope the most arcane, come bugger me, Delcour, make haste. . . 
for we must leave no del ght untasted, no horror uncommitted.” 

“Great God!” said Delcour, in transports, ‘I didn’t dare pro- 
pose it to you; but behold how your desires inflame mine.” 

And indeed my fucker exhibited a prick harder, longer than 
any I’d clapped eyes on hitherto. 

“Beloved libertine,” said I, ‘‘are you then fond of ass?” 

“Ah, Madame, is there anything that affords comparable 
pleasure?” 

“°Tis all too plain, my dear,” said I, “when you accustom 
yourself to defying one of the laws of Nature, you do not take 
authentic pleasure anymore except in transgressing them all, one 
after the other.” 

And Delcour, master of the altar I abandoned to him entirely, 
covered it, though ’twas drenched in blood, with the tenderest 
caresses. His tongue thrilled in the hole, my temperature soared. 
The slut operating upon me frontwardly set my cunt afire. Fuck 
gushed out of me afresh, I was dry, I could bear no more; but I 
was not by any means easy; I suddenly lost all interest in Delcour, 
then all patience with him. Great had been my desire for the man, 
great was my abhorrence for him now. And there’s the effect of 
irregular desires: the greater the height they arouse us to, the 
greater the emptiness we feel afterward. From this cretins derive 
proof of God's existence; whereas for my part I find here only the 
most certain proofs in support of a materialistic attitude: the more 
you cheapen your existence, the less I'll be inclined to believe it is the 
handiwork of a deity. Delcour sent off to his bedchamber, I retired 
for the night with my Lesbian hireling. 

Saint-Fond put in his appearance the next day around noon; 
he dismissed his servants and his coach, and came directly into the 
salon to greet me; we erabraced. Uncertain what his reaction would 


Juliette 2 313 


be to the little prank I had played with Delcour, but anxious lest 
he hear the story from someone else, I told him everything. 

“Juliette,” he said when I had concluded, “had I not assured 
you long ago that I would take the most indulgent view of your 
aberrations, I would scold you now. We can ignore the fuckery, ’tis 
natural to fuck; your one mistake was in your choice of a partner. 
Are you so sure you can rely upon Delcour’s discretion? I am glad, 
however, that you have made his acquaintance; for two years he 
was my bardash when he was fourteen and fifteen: he is from 
Nantes where his father was hangman, a fact which stimulated my 
interest in the boy: I took his maidenhead, and when I was weary 
toying with his ass, I turned him over to the Paris executioner, 
whose aide he remained up unti. the time his father died; he in- 
herited his post at Nantes. The lad is not without intelligence, he 
is excessively libertine; and as I just hinted, he isn’t the sort who 
merits overmuch trust. But let me tell you something about the 
captives we are going to put to death. 

“Of all the men in France, Monsieur de Cloris has probably 
contributed most to my advancement; the year I was preferred to 
the Ministry, he, though very young at the time, was sleeping with 
the Duchesse de G*** whose power at court was immense, and 
owing primarily to the maneuvering and intrigues of the two of 
them, I obtained from the King the position I still hold. As of that 
moment I contracted an insuperable loathing for Cloris; I would 
go to any lengths to avoid encountering him, I dreaded the sight 
of him, I hated him; so long as his protectress was alive I postponed 
taking action; but she has just passed away, or, perhaps, I have 
just put her out of the way; this brought Cloris to the top of my 
black list; he married my cousin-german.” 

“What, my Lord! This woman is your cousin?” 

“She is, Juliette, and the fact has contributed not a little to 
her doom. I had designs upon that woman; she always resisted my 
desires. Little by little they shifted to her daughter; here I met 
with yet more stubborn resistance; with the result that my rage, 
and my extreme desire to see the whole family gone to blazes, 
reached the decisive pitch. To promote its undoing I resorted to 
every known kind of cunning, baseness, lie, and calumny; and I 
have finally so aroused the Queen’s antipathies to the father and 


314 -% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


daughter, by giving her to understand that Cloris once sold his 
child to the King, that at our last interview Her Majesty, much 
wrought up, commanded me to arrange their deaths. She adamantly 
insists upon having their heads by tomorrow; my recompense has 
been fixed at three million apiece: I shall obey the Queen’s orders 
and very joyfully, you may be sure, and very pleasurable will be 
the episodes wherewith I plan to accompany my revenge.” 

“My Lord, ’tis this 1 dreadful complication of crimes, it puts 
my brain into an indescridable whirl.” 

“Tt affects mine likewise, my angel, and I arrive here with the 
most execrable intentions. I’ve.not discharged for a week; no one 
is more adept than I in the art of whetting the passions through 
abstinence; and having a good time the while. Over the past seven 
days I’ve probably been fucked two hundred shots, and had inti- 
mately to do with somewhere between a hundred and seven score 
individuals of both sexes, but during this interval not a drop of 
fuck have I yielded. From thus playing coy with Nature I have 
achieved a pent-up state that bodes very ill for the persons upon 
whom the storm is due to break. . . . Have you given orders that 
we be left alone and that nobody, saving only those who are neces- 
sary to the scene, be under any circumstances admitted to the 
house?” 

“Yes, my Lord. And I have added that anybody who ventures 
to intrude shall be hanged on the spot: a squadron of troopers is 
lying at Sceaux to lend me assistance in case of need; never has 
stage been more impeccably set for a crime. We shall, the two of 
us, be able to relish the pleasure of committing it under ideal con- 
ditions and in absolute security.” 

“Ah, you see into what state whatever you say puts me.” 

“In truth, I believe you are discharging.” 

“And you ?” 

Whereupon, in search of proof positive of a crisis which I 
was indeed undergoing, ‘he rake lifts my skirt above my navel and 
ferrets briefly about in ray cunt; then he examines his fingers, and 
finds them slimed with damning evidence of my lewd agitation. 

’ “You know,” the Minister confesses, “I adore discovering 
such symptoms in you, for they roundly attest the similarity of our 


Juliette & 315 


ways of thinking. But hold, I must bib at the tap I’ve set to 
flowing.” 

And gluing his mouth to my cunt, the villain drank thereat a 
good quarter of an hour; then rolled me over. “Ah,” said he, 
“there’s what I like to kiss most of all—the peerless hole. Eh, 
rascal, it’s been traveled recently, has it not? You've been bum- 
fucked of late, ’tis very plain to be seen.” All the while he went on 
cooing and kissing about my vent and the area environing; now he 
has his breeches off, shows me his own ass, and I fall to licking it. 

“You manage that wonderfully well, you little minx,” says he, 
“I do declare, I think you love my ass. Here’s my prick, it’s starting 
to stand, suck it a bit; and suggest a few extravagances if you can: 
the hour of Venus should be rung in by the bells of Folly.” 

“The weather is warm,” I said, “I recommend that you adopt 
savage attire, leaving your arms, thighs, and prick bare; your 
headdress ought to resemble a dragon or serpent in the Patagonian 
manner, you'll smear red grease paint all over your face, we'll fit 
you with moustaches, you'll wear a baldric, girding on all the instru- 
ments required for the tortures you plan to inflict upon your 
victims: this costume will terrify them for a certainty, and it is 
terror one should inspire when one wishes to wallow in crime.” 

“You are right, Juliette, you are quite right. I'll ask you to 
rig me out in that way.” 

“Apparel and gear are imperative; tell me if in the courts of 
law our precious buffoons, the judges, don’t resemble heroes out 
of comedy or charlatans.” 

““My sole objection to the magistracy nowadays is that it is 
composed of men sorely lacking in sanguinary temper, and if these 
are such unruly times, we may lay it up to that. Rest assured, 
Juliette: better not even to try your hand at governing men unless 
you are willing to immerse it in their blood.” 

Dinner was announced, we repaired to table and pursued our 
conversation in the same tone. 

“Yes by all means,” the Minister proceeded, “the laws must 
be made more severe; the only happily governed countries are those 
where the Inquisition reigns. They alone are really under their 
sovereigns’ control; the purpose of: sacerdotal chains, and the need 
for them, is to reinforce political ones: the might of the scepter 


316 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


depends on that of the censer, it is hugely in the interest of both 
authorities, lay and clerical, to stay each other mutually, and only 
by breaking that common front will the people ever achieve their 
liberation. Nothing so effectively cows a nation as religious fears; 
nothing better than that it dread hell’s eternal fires if it revolts 
against its overlord; and that’s why the crowned heads of Europe 
are always in such admirable intelligence with Rome. We other 
great ones of this world do indeed despise and defy the fabulous 
thunderbolts of a contemptible Vatican, but we are well advised to 
keep our slaves in terror of them; once again ’tis there the sole 
means to keep them under the yoke. Steeped in Machiavelli, I 
would want the disparity between the king and the mob to be no 
less considerable than that between a heavenly body and a cock- 
roach; a mere gesture on the part of the monarch, and his throne 
would become an island in a very sea of blood; beheld as a god on 
earth, his subjects woulc only dare crawl into his presence on their 
hands and knees. Who i fool enough even to compare the physical 
constitution, yes, the mere physical constitution of a king with that 
of a commoner? I’m willing to believe that Nature gave them the 
same needs—the lion and the earthworm have the same needs also; 
but does this create a resemblance between them? Oh, Juliette, do 
not forget that if kings are beginning to lose their credit in Europe, 
it’s the vulgarity they've become attainted with that has been their 
downfall; had they remained aloof and invisible like the sovereigns 
of Asia, the whole wor.d would yet tremble at the sound of their 
names. Contempt is bred of familiarity, and familiarity from what 
is daily within public vizw; the Romans must surely have stood in 
greater awe of Tiberius off on Capri than of a Titus wandering 
around the city consoling the poor.” 

“But this despotism,” I said to Saint-Fond, ‘“‘you favor it 
because you are so powerful; do you suppose however that it is 
equally pleasing to the weak ?” 

“It pleases everybody, Juliette,” Saint-Fond replied; ‘mankind 
tends universally in that direction. To be despotic is the primary 
desire inspired in us by a Nature whose law could not be more un- 
like the ludicrous one usually ascribed to her, the substance of 
which is not to do unto others that which unto ourselves we would 
not have done .. . from fear of reprisals, they should have added, 


Julictte «& 317 


for very certain it is that only weaklings, dreading tit for tat, could 
have contrived this homily; and they must have been desperate as 
well as insolent rogues to dare to fob it off as a natural law. I afirm 
that the fundamental, profoundest, and keenest penchant in man is 
incontestably to enchain his fellow creatures and to tyrannize them 
with all his might. The suckling babe that bites his nurse’s nipple, 
the infant constantly smashing his rattle, reveal to us that a bent 
for destruction, cruelty, and oppression is the first which Nature 
graves in our hearts, and that we surrender to it more or less 
violently according to the amount of sensibility we are endowed 
with from the outset. I therefore hold it self-evident, that all the 
pleasures which ornament the life of a man, all the delights he is 
able to savor, all that makes for the extreme delectation of his 
passions, are essentially located in his despotic usage of his 
brethren. The sequestration, in voluptuous Asia, of the objects 
accessory to pleasure-taking demonstrates to us, does it not, that 
lust gains with oppression and tyranny, and that the passions are 
more strongly fired by whatever is obtained through force than by 
anything granted voluntarily. When it is logically established that 
the degree of violence characterizing the action committed is the 
one factor for measuring the amount of happiness of the active 
person—and this because where the violence is greater the shock 
upon the nervous system will be sharper—as soon, I say, as that 
is proven, the greatest possible dose of happiness will necessarily 
consist in the greatest of the effects of despotism and tyranny; 
whence it will emerge that the harshest, the most ferocious, the 
most traitorous and the wickedest man will be the happiest man; 
and that stands to reason. For as Noirceuil has often told you, 
happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue; but in the manner we 
appreciate the one and the other, and the choice we make pursuant 
to our individual organization. It isn’t in the meal set before me 
my appetite lies, my need is nowhere but in me, and two people may 
be very differently affected by the same fare: it makes his mouth 
water who is hungry, excites repugnance in him who has just eaten 
his fill: however, as ’tis certain there must be some difference be- 
tween the vibrations received, and that vice must procure much more 
intense ones in the individual with the vicious bent than virtue can 
give to the person whose organs are structured for its reception; 


318 <& THE MARQUIS DE’ SADE 


that, although Vespasian had a good soul and Nero an evil, despite 
the fact both were sensitive, there was a great difference in the 
temper of those souls as regards the species of sensibility constitut- 
ing them: for Nero’s was without doubt endowed with a faculty of 
sensation far superior to Vespasian’s; ’tis certain, I say, that of the 
two, Nero was the happier man by far; why? because that which 
affects more intensely will always produce the happier effect in 
man; and because a vigorous person, owing to his very vigor so 
structured as to be a better recipient of vicious than of virtuous 
impressions, will sooner discover felicity than a mild and peaceable 
individual, whose feeble complexion will deny him all possibilities 
other than the abject, hangdog, woebegone practice of the formulas 
of humdrum good behavior; and what the devil would the merit 
be in virtue if vice weren’t preferable to it? Thus, I tell you, 
Vespasian and Nero were as happy as they were able to be, but 
Nero must have been rnuch more so, because his pleasures were 
incomparably livelier and keener; while Vespasian, in giving an 
alm to some beggar (simply because as he himself said, the poor 
have got to live), was stirred in an infinitely less intense manner 
than Nero, a lyre in his hand, watching Rome burn from atop the 
tower of Antonia. ‘Ah,’ somebody will say, ‘but deification was the 
reward of the one, disparagement and hate that of the other.’ As 
you wish; however, it is not the effect their souls had upon others 
I am interested in; I am simply evaluating the inward sensation 
which the different penchants native to each must have made each 
experience, and discriminating between the vibrations each was 
capable of feeling. Thus I am able to affirm that the happiest 
man on earth will inevitably be he who is addicted to the most 
infamous, the most revolting, the most criminal habits, and who 
exercises them the most: frequently—who, every day, doubles their 
force, triples their scope.” 

“The most outstanding service one could do to some young 
person,” I observed after hearing this speech, “would then be to 
pluck out of him all the weeds of virtue Nature or education might 
have sown in his soul ?”’ 

“That is exact, siatch them out and if possible stifle them 
while they are yet in seed,” Saint-Fond answered. “For even 
supposing the individual in whom you annihilate these virtuous 


Juliette 2 319 


possibilities were to maintain he finds happiness in virtue, you, 
perfectly certain you will cause him to find far greater happiness in 
vice, ought never to hesitate to blot out the one in order to permit 
the other to waken; ’tis a real and capital service he'll thank you 
for sooner or later: and that is why, very different from my 
predecessor, I authorize the publication and sale of all libertine 
books and immoral works; for I esteem them most essential to 
human felicity and welfare, instrumental to the progress of philoso- 
phy, indispensable to the eradication of prejudices, and in every 
sense conducive to the increase of human knowledge and under- 
standing. Any author courageous enough to tell the truth fear- 
lessly shall have my patronage and support; I shall subsidize his 
ideas, I shall see to their dissemination; such men are rare, the 
State has great need of them, and their labors cannot be too 
heartily encouraged.” 

“But,” I inquired, “how does this sit with the severity you 
favor in government? with the Inquisition you would establish?” 

“As nicely as you please,” Saint-Fond replied; “‘it is to keep 
the people in their place I urge severity, and if I so often imagine 
the autos-da-fé of Lisbon transferred to Paris, it is in the interests 
of subordination. My knife will never be drawn against the upper 
classes, the élite in substance or mind.” 

“But must not these writings, if generally read, pose a threat 
to those very persons you seem to wish to keep out of harm’s way?” 

“Impossible,” declared the Minister. “If these texts quicken 
in the weak the desire to break their bonds (and mind you, lest they 
have that desire I cannot forge bonds at all), the strong, for their 
part, will find instruction therein upon how to load further and 
heavier chains upon the captive masses. In short, the slave will per- 
haps accomplish in a decade what the master will have accomplished 
in a night.” 

“You are widely accused,” I now ventured to remark, ‘“‘of 
persistent condescension in everything that touches the growing 
depravity of manners nowadays; never, so it is said, were they so 
corrupt as since you entered into office.” 

“Perhaps, but we still have an enormous task to achieve before 
they are as I’d like to see them; and at the present time I am 
working upon some new police regulations which, I hope, will help 


320 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


matters along in the proper direction. I do not believe it is a secret, 
at any rate it is a fact whereof you cannot afford not to be fully 
aware, Juliette: a vital chapter in the policy followed by all those 
at the head of any government is to foment and promote the 
extremest degree of corruption in the citizenry; so long as the 
subject wastes away body and soul in the delights of gangrenous, 
enfeebling debauchery, he does not feel the weight of his irons, 
and you can heap fresh ones upon him without his even noticing. 
The true essence of stat:ecraft is thus to multiply a hundredfold 
every possible means to debilitate and pervert the people. Lots of 
shows, much pomp and clisplay, cabarets, brothels without number, 
a general amnesty for all crimes committed in debauchery: those 
are the expedients for bringing the plebeians to heel. O you who 
ambition to rule over them, beware of virtue within the frontiers 
of your empire, only let: virtue reign and your peoples will open 
their eyes, and your thrones, reposing as they do upon nothing but 
vice, will be very speedily overthrown; the free man’s awakening 
will be cruel for the despots, and the day he ceases to fritter his 
leisure away in vices he’ll start to strive for domination like 
yourselves.” 

‘And what are your proposed regulations?” I asked. 

“It’s by means of fashion I aim to mold public opinion at first; 
you know how the French are influenced by the latest in vogue. 

“1) Iam launching: a new style in masculine and feminine dress 
which leaves all the lust-inspiring parts, and the ass especially, 
exposed in their virtual entirety. 

2) There will be spectacles after the model of the Floral 
Games they used to holcl in glorious Rome, at them lads and lasses 
will dance naked. 

3) Instead of morality and religion, which will be stricken 
from the curriculum, the pure and unadulterated principles of 
Nature will be taught in the public schools; every child of either 
sex who has reached the age of fifteen without having been able to 
get a lover will be very sharply reprimanded, penalized, held up to 
public scorn and dishonor, and declared if a girl, forever ineligible 
for marriage, for holding any office, if a boy; in default of a lover, 
the boy or girl will be obliged to present a certificate proving 
prostitution and nonpossession of virginity in any shape or place. 


Juliette % 321 


“4) Christianity will be rigorously banished out of the land; 
none but libertine rites and feasts will ever be celebrated in France. 
I'll be rid of Christianity, I say: but not of religion, this I intend 
to retain, for its chains are useful to the preservation of order as I 
proved to you a moment ago. The object of worship doesn’t matter 
in the slightest, the thing that counts is clergy; but I’d rather see 
the dagger of superstition wielded by the priests of Venus than by 
the admirers of Mary. 

‘‘5) The common herd will be kept in a state of subservience, 
of prostrate bondage, which will render them powerless even to 
strike for, let alone to attain to, domination, or to encroach upon 
or debase the prerogatives of the rich. Tied to the glebe as in olden 
days, the people will be held like any other property, and, like it, 
will be subject to all the various mutations of value and ownership. 
Only the people will be liable to punishment at the hands of the 
law, and it will be inflicted for the most trifling offenses. The com- 
moner’s proprietor will have the right of life or death over him 
and his family, and neither his complaints nor his recriminations 
will ever receive hearing. Never will free schools be available to 
him: tilling the soil does not require knowledge, the blindfold of 
ignorance is made for the peasant’s eyes, showing him the light is 
always a risky business. The first individual, regardless of his 
class, who were to think to stir up the people or to invite them to 
break their chains will be thrown to wild beasts and eaten alive. 

‘‘6) In every town and city of the land there shall be opened 
public houses containing specimens of both sexes, the number of 
these houses to be proportional to the population of the district or 
agglomeration, there being at least one male and one female estab- 
lishment per every thousand inhabitants; the personnel of each 
shall be three hundred individuals, who will begin their internment 
at the age of twelve and not retire from service before twenty-five. 
These establishments will be subsidized by the government; only 
members of the free class will have the right of entrance and they 
will of course be empowered to do in these places whatever they 
please. 

-“7) Everything denominated crime of libertinage at present, 
to wit: murder in debauch, incest, rape, sodomy, adultery, etc., will 
be reprehensible only if committed by a member of the slave castes. 


322 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“8) Prizes shall be awarded to the most celebrated courtesans 
in the bawdy houses, likewise to the young boys there who have 
got themselves a name in the art of pleasing. Similarly, bonuses and 
stipends shall be granted to each inventor of a new lubricity, to 
every author of cynical 3ooks, to all libertines recognized as pro- 
fessed in their order. 

“Q) The slave class shall exist as did the Helots in ancient 
Lacedaemon. There being no difference whatsoever between the 
human slave and the brute beast, why should you punish the mur- 
derer of the one more than the murderer of the other?” 

““My Lord,” I put in, “this last, it seems to me, deserves some 
slight explaining. I would like to have you prove to me there is 
no real distinction to be drawn between the human slave and an 
animal.” 

“Glance at the works of Nature,” this philosopher answered 
me, ‘‘and judge for yourself whether she has not, in forming the 
two classes of men, made them vastly unalike; I ask you to put 
aside partiality, and to decide: have they the same voice, the same 
skin, the same limbs, the same gait, the same tastes, have they, I 
venture to inquire, have they the same needs? It will be to no pur- 
pose if someone attempts to persuade me that circumstances or 
education have made for these differences and that the slave and 
the master, in a state of Nature, as infants, will be indistinguish- 
able. I deny the fact; and it is after having pondered the matter 
and sifted much personal observation, after having examined the 
findings of clever anatomists, that I affirm there is no similarity 
between the conformations of these several infants. Abandon them 
both to themselves, and you'll observe that the child of the first 
class manifests tastes and aims most unlike those the child of the 
second class demonstrates; and you will perceive the most striking 
dissimilarity between the sentiments and dispositions proper to 
each. 

“Now perform the same study upon the animal resembling 
man the closest, upon, “or example, the chimpanzee; let me, I say, 
compare this animal to some representative of the slave caste; what 
a host of similarities I find! The man of the people is simply the 
species that stands nex: above the chimpanzee on the ladder; and 
the distance separating them is, if anything, less than that between 


Juliette 323 


him and the individual belonging to the superior caste. And why 
should Nature, who so assiduously observes these gradations in 
all her works, have neglected them here? Are all plants alike? No. 
Are all animals the same in aspect and strength? No. Dare you 
compare a shrub to the majestic poplar, a pug-dog to the proud 
Great Dane, the Corsican mountain pony to the spirited Andalus- 
ian stallion? So many essential differences within the same over-all 
categories; and why do you object to the same differences existing 
among men? You should certainly never lump Voltaire and Fréron 
in the same class, any more than you would the virile Prussian 
grenadier and the debilitated Hottentot. Therefore, Juliette, cease 
to doubt these inequalities; and, admitting their existence, let’s not 
hesitate to take full advantage of them, and to persuade ourselves 
that if it so suited Nature to have us born into the upper of these 
two human classes, we have but to extract profit and pleasure from 
our situation by worsening that of our inferiors, and despotically 
to press them into the service of all our passions and our every 
need.” 

“Kiss me, my beloved,” I cried, throwing myself into the arms 
of a man whose principles I simply could not resist; “to me you 
are as a god, ’tis at your feet I want to pass my life.” : 

“Apropos,” remarked the Minister, getting up from the table 
and leading me to the couch in the salon, “I forgot to tell you that 
the King is fonder of me than ever; I’ve just had new proof of his 
attachment. From somewhere he got the idea I am burdened by 
heavy debts, and has given me two million to straighten out my 
affairs. "Tis only just that you share in my good fortune, Juliette; I 
am turning half the gift over to you; continue to approve my tenets 
and to serve me well, I’ll raise you so high in the world you'll have 
no more trouble believing in your superiority over others: you can- 
not imagine the joy I derive in advancing you to atop the very 
pinnacle, and making your pre-eminence conditional upon profound 
humility and unbounded obedience toward me alone. I wish you to 
be the idol of others and, at the same time, my slave; the mere 
thought heats my prick. . . . Juliette, we'll perform horrors this 
day, shan’t we, my angel? horrors, atrocities?” 

And he pressed his lips to mine, the while toying with my cunt. 

“Oh, my love, how delicious are our crimes when impunity 


324 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


veils them, when duty itself prescribes them. How divine it is to 
swim in gold and, as one reckons up one’s wealth, to be able to say, 
here are the means to every black deed, to every pleasure; with this, 
all my wishes can be made to come true, all my fancies can be satis- 
fied; no woman will resist me, none of my desires will fail of 
realization, my wealth will procure amendments in the law itself, 
and Ill be despot without let or hindrance.” 

I kissed Saint-Fond a thousand times over and, profiting from 
the enthusiasm, the drunkenness he was carried away by, and above 
all from his predisposition to me, I had him sign a lettre de cachet 
written out for the arrest of Elvire’s father, who wished to deprive 
me of her, and wheedled two or three other favors out of him, each 
of which was worth about five hundred thousand francs to me. And 
the fumes of the excellent: dinner I had just provided him rising to 
his head, he announced he was sleepy and would retire for a little; 
he departed to his chamber, and I looked to the completion of the 
arrangements for the evening’s entertainments. 

Saint-Fond woke toward five that afternoon. By then every- 
thing stood ready in the salon, and this is the way the scene and the 
actors were disposed: nucle and simply decked in garlands of roses, 
there were, on the right, the three maids intended for the orgies; 
I'd grouped them like Botticelli’s Graces: all three were girls of 
condition spirited out of a convent at Melun, and their beauty was 
startling. 

Louise was the name of the first: she was sixteen, fair-haired, 
and never was a more interesting face beheld. 

The second was named Helene: fifteen years old, slender in the 
waist, slight of build and tall for her age, long brown tresses, 
Love’s own eyes and mouth; beautiful though she was, most would 
have admitted her to be surpassed by Fulvie, ravishing and also 
sixteen. 

In the center, to offer a contrast to this group, I had stationed 
the ill-starred family, likewise naked and festooned with black 
crépe: the father and the mother were watching each other in ex- 
pectation of the worst, at their feet lay the charming Julie; heavy 
irons rubbed their bare skin raw, the nipple on Julie’s left breast 
peeped through a link, which had bruised it, and it bled softly. 
Another length of chain was visible between the thighs of Madame 


Juliette % 325 


de Cloris, and was pinching the lips of her womb; Delcour, whom 
I had outfitted in the terrifying garb of a demon out of hell and 
armed with the sword he was to use upon his victims, held the end 
of the chain which ever and again he would tug, with dreadful effect 
wherever it touched flesh. 

_ Next, in the pose of Callipygian Venus, their backs to Saint-. 
Fond, draped in a simple brown-and-white gauze which left their 
asses very distinctly in sight, were my four women: 

The first was twenty-two, superb, a veritable Minerva, mag- 
nificently formed; her name was Deélie. 

The name of the second was Montalme: twenty, in full bloom, 
as nicely fleshed as woman can be. 

Palmire was nineteen. She was blonde and had the romantic 
countenance of those girls you always like to see in tears. 

Seventeen years old, Blaisine had a mischievous look, faultless 
teeth, the sauciest eyes that ever fired desire. 

And at the far left of this semicircle were placed two strapping 
lads, five feet and ten inches in height, awesomely membered; they 
were standing face to face and while frigging each other were ex- 
changing passionate kisses. They were naked. 

“Charming,” said Saint-Fond upon opening his eyes, .“heav- 
enly! No possible mistake, all this attests the mind and art of 
Juliette. Have the guilty ones brought hither,” he continued, direct- 
ing me to take a seat beside him, Montalme to come and suck his 
engine, Palmire to place her ass within his reach. 

Delcour marched the family forward. 

‘You are all three under accusation of enormous crimes,” the 
Minister began, “and from the Queen I have express orders to put 
you promptly to death.” 

“They are unjust orders,” Cloris replied, ‘my family and I 
are innocent—as you know full well, you wretch! (At this point 
Saint-Fond was prey to a pleasurable emotion so puissant he was 
scarce able to fight off a discharge.) Yes, you know perfectly weil 
that we are innocent. But if we are under suspicion, then let us be 
put on fair trial, but not exposed this way to the tigerish lust of 
one who sports with us only to quicken his ignoble passions.” 

“Tf you please, Delcour,” said the Minister, ‘‘a taste of the 
chain.” 


326 -& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And the executioner gave it a jerk, so sudden, so violent, 
that the cunt of Madame de Cloris, the breast of her, daughter, 
one of her husband’s thighs were cut into, blood spurted on the 
iron. 

Then Saint-Fond said, “You allude to the law. You have 
broken the law, you have violated it too grievously to invoke its 
protection; its full severity is all you have a right to expect now. 
Ready yourselves to die.” 

“You,” was Cloris’ proud answer, ‘‘you are the hireling of a 
tyrant and the creature cf a whore. Posterity will judge me.” 

Here Saint-Fond rises in fury; his prick is prettily grown; 
he beckons to me, ‘“‘Come.” Going close to the well-chained insolent, 
the Minister slaps him with all his might several times, insults him, 
spits in his face and, fr gging his weapon on Julie’s teats, defies 
her father: ‘‘You are ill used? Call not on the opinion of later 
times, but take matters into your own hands now. Are you a man? 
Then exert yourself a little.” 

“Coward, were I to get free you'd run off in a panic!” 

“You are quite right. But you are not going to get free, 1 
have you in my power, I enjoy the situation; would you deprive me 
of enjoyment? Try.” 

“Everything you have, you owe to me.” 

“You have only yourself to blame for that,” the Minister 
said; and took hold of his benefactor’s prick, massaged it; then 
bade me endeavor to bring it to life. But my efforts were fruitless 
also; seeing this, he saici to Delcour, “Separate this man from his 
family, attach him to that stake. The Queen having left to my dis- 
cretion the choice of tortures that are to prelude your deaths,” 
Saint-Fond continued, now addressing the two women, “I mean to 
subject you to a certain amount of lewd handling; Cloris will be 
witness to it.” 

Noticing that Delcour was not binding the husband to the 
stake quite as firmly as he wished, Saint-Fond lent the executioner 
his assistance, and showered a further series of blows upon the 
man’s face and behind. 

“T shall kill him myself,” he told Delcour. “Yes, I want to have 
the pleasure of shedding his blood in person.” 

As always methodically combining horror and lechery, he 


Juliette 2 327 


bent forward, sucked Cloris’ prick a moment, then kissed his ass. 
Delcour being hard by, he took that worthy’s prick in his mouth 
too, and tongued his vent; straightened up and glued his lips to 
Delcour’s; and after five minutes of this, confided to me, ‘‘That’s 
the only thing that really puts a little snap in my whip.” There 
followed an interval during which Saint-Fond was plunged in 
crapulousness and atrocity; emerging from these, he returned to 
objects of my sex. 

“Ah, my Lord!” said those poor creatures as he drew near 
them, ‘“‘what have we done to deserve such barbarous treatment ?”’ 

“Be courageous, wife,” cried the luckless husband, ‘death 
shall soon deliver us from these outrages, we'll suffer no more and 
remorse shall gnaw at this monster’s soul.” 

“Remorse,” said Saint-Fond, chuckling, “is not a sentiment 
wherewith I shall ever have acquaintance, lest it be for sparing 
you.” 

First to be unbound was Madame de Cloris. She was brought 
to the Minister. 

“Ah, whore,” said he, “do you remember all the obstacles you 
hurled in my path, all your stubbornness in the past? Dear cousin, 
cherished cousin, sweet cousin, I’ll have you cheap today.” 

His erection was something extraordinary to behold; he falls 
to pawing the woman’s charms; catching her around the waist, 
he brutally encunts her before the very eyes of her husband, whose 
prick, thanks to the position Saint-Fond has adopted, he is able 
to mouth the while. And I, finding his ass a fair target, strap a 
dildo about my loins and embugger him; men and women together, 
all the others save Julie and Cloris surround him. Into his hands, 
before his eyes, I place cunts, asses, pricks, bubs in profusion; 
excited by the demon of cruelty, his fingers. rake about, his nails 
claw and tear whatever they touch; but they rove with especial 
predilection over the breasts of the unhappy woman his rage feeds 
upon: these he scrapes, nips, bloodies incontinently. 

‘Take that stuff away, Juliette,” says he, decunting from the 
mother in order to have at the daughter, “I’m tired of discharg- 
ing. Little whore,” he declares to the innocent creature under his 
belly, “your father and your mother are both aware of all I did in 


328 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


my attempts to gain possession of you: I have you today, and today 
they’re going to regret having thwarted me previously.” 

He then had Cloris placed in such wise that while fucking the 
daughter he might have a clear view of papa’s handsome hind- 
quarters, the which Delcour was to thwack with one hand as, with 
the other, he molested mama’s buttocks, both their asses being at 
the same height, and adjacent. Tis I who help him depucelate 
Julie: he takes good aim, he presses, he thrusts, he encunts; and 
eight poised asses ring him round. He is sodomized: and the 
wicked wight, considering the torments Delcour is inflicting not 
severe enough, snatches up a small stiletto and indiscriminately 
pricks the mother’s dugs, the daughter’s shoulders, the father’s 
rear. Blood flows. 

‘Aye, but I'll not discharge into this vessel of abomination,” 
snaps the satyr, decunting:; ‘“‘no; it’s rather there,” says he, fondling 
the father’s bum, ‘“‘the shrine at which I’ll do my sacrifice.” 

He gives orders that Cloris, his hands still tied, be stretched 
out upon the fatal sofa. 

‘“Delcour, noose a cord around his neck; if we have any re- 
sistance from him, tighter: till it ceases.” 

Again superintending the operation, I artfully guide the fiery 
courser to the edge of the road it is to charge down; there’s 
not a murmur out of poor Cloris. Squarely ahead of him are posted 
the mother’s bosom on the right and on the left the daughter’s 
pretty little ass. The Minister is no sooner ensheathed in the bowels 
he has been coveting, than his hands, one of them wielding the 
dread stiletto, begin to stray hither and yon about the attractions 
displayed to him and so <lisplayed that, whenever he jabs, ’tis upon 
the father’s head flows the blood drawn from the wife or from the 
daughter. As all this goes forward I diddle about his asshole and 
my women prick his buttocks with hatpins. 

“Ah, well,” says he after a time, “‘it seems I’m yet again mis- 
taken. My sperm won’t loosen, and I fancy that’s because I want 
first to explore this tru'y very winning family’s asses. Delcour, 
chain the old bardash back to the stake, he’s been of no use save to 
cover my prick with shit. You, the tall one,” says he to Montalme, 
“come lick it clean.” 

Detecting in Monta\me a certain unreadiness to comply, Saint- 


Juliette t% 329 


Fond instantly commands Delcour to administer a hundred lashes 
to teach her obedience. 

“Ah, the whore, the whore,” he murmurs while her instructor 
toils over her, “you are loath to suck my prick because it’s beshitted ? 
Whatever shall you do when in a little while I give you mards to 
eat?” 

Montalme, well whipped, returns in a different humor; she 
sucks the lecher, tidies his member, cleans his asshole out next; and 
going tranquilly back to work, there he is sodomizing the mother, 
the while molesting the ass of the father on the one side, his 
daughter’s cunt on the other. These exercises occupy him only 
briefly; now he fastens upon Julie, saying, “I hope this will turn 
the trick.” 

Ever in the pilot’s role, I steer him into Julie’s hindward 
channel, and once he is safe berthed every conceivable thing is 
done to deliver him of his seed; but, whether from villainy or from 
contrariness or from impotence, he quits this ass too, declaring 
he’s spent and if he’s to recover his strength must thrash the whole 
family. The father, already secured to the post, is flogged first. 
Straightway he’s all bloodied, his wife is tied with her belly to his 
back; a thousand strokes lay her ass open, then little Julie, camped 
upon her mother’s shoulders, is given the same treatment. 

“Unassemble them,” says the centaur, “’twas an agreeable 
episode, now we'll essay another: I’ll whip the youngster afresh, 
but her parents will. hold her this time. Juliette, and you, Delcour, 
take you each a pistol, ‘clap it to their heads, and if while I’m at 
work on their child they so much as flinch, blow their brains out.” 

In charge of the mother, I wanted nothing so much as to have 
her show some recalcitrance; but, taking comfort in the thought she 
was soon to die under circumstances far less mild than mere shoot- 
ing, I grew cheerful again after having been downcast‘and alarmed 
initially by her submissiveness. Poor Julie, abused with unexampled 
fury, first lashed with withes, was next flogged with a martinet the 
thongs whereof had her blood splashing all about the room; when 
done with her, Saint-Fond falls upon her father and using no other 
weapon but this martinet, its lashes iron-tipped, has him swimming 
in blood inside three minutes. The mother is seized without delay, 
she is installed on the edge of the sofa, her legs at the greatest 


330 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


possible spread and he bends the martinet to her, aiming his blows 
so they will strike into her open womb. I followed him wherever 
he went, now frigging him, now beating him, now sucking his 
tongue, or his prick. Raging, he wheels on the daughter, bestows 
upon her a pair of blows so terribly violent she and her manacles 
fly all aheap; the mother would come to her aid, he awaits her; 
kicked in the belly, she lands five yards off. Cloris was rolling his 
eyes, foaming at the mouth, but he dared not utter a word; bound 
hand and foot, what could he do? The girl is hauled to her feet; 
Saint-Fond directs the executioner to cunt-fuck her, and he himself, 
he sodomizes the executioner, while I, employing sweet words and 
having unbound hin, I promise the father his life will be spared and 
his family’s also if he can succeed in buggering the Minister. Hope 
ever rises up in the soul of the doomed: cunningly frigged by my 
hand, his quivering lance penetrates the chink. Saint-Fond, positively 
thrilled to feel so stout a prick in his fundament, dances and skips 
like the gleeful fish thrown back into water after having been a 
while in the air. 

“Tis divine, and he’s assured of release and safety,” says the 
Minister, “if, profiting speedily from the admirable state my ass 
tells me his prick is in, he consents to bugger-fuck his daughter.” 

“Monsieur,” I said to this gentleman, ‘“‘ought you hesitate? 
For is it not better a hundred times that you fuck your child than 
murder her?” 

“Murder her!”’ 

“Why yes, Monsieur; do you refuse and she’s undone. Dead, 
I say, if you balk.” 

And the while one of the women holds the little girl’s buttocks 
at full divide and moistens the hole within, I quickly snatch the 
engine out of Saint-Fond’s bum and clap it to the threshold of 
Julie’s; but Cloris, in revolt, drives not past the gate. 

“So be it, so be it, since he won’t fuck her,” says Saint-Fond, 
“she’ll have to die.”’ 

At this cruel prorouncement resistance melts away. I fit the 
girl’s loins up near the member, I push it into the anus; for as much 
as the requisite preparations have all been made, my efforts cul- 
minate in triumph, and Cloris who would not become the child- 
murderer becomes incestuous to the tune of a liberal outgushing of 


Juliette 2 331 


fuck. Délie was fustigating Saint-Fond, in the meantime he was 
vexing the mother’s ass and kissing the buttocks of one of the 
lackeys; but this lackey is soon fucking him, and now a close-on view 
of Délie’s behind seems to inspire him. The inconstant Saint-Fond 
ordered this group dissolved too; still stubbornly holding his seed 
in check, he appears before us in a greater fury than any wild beast: 
he shrieks, he bellows, there’s foam on his lips, curses in his mouth; 
as soon as Delcour spews into Julie’s cunt, he has him embugger her 
mother. At length the storm abates a little; Saint-Fond resumes 
his chair and orders me to bring up for his examination the three 
young girls of whom heretofore he has not taken anything but 
casual notice. He fingers and caresses their asses a quarter of an 
hour; he separates their buttocks, he compresses them, he compares 
them; and I frig him all this while; and he admits that, in a word, 
I have never found him better stuff. He is especially taken by Fulvie. 

“I'd bugger her, be sure of it,” the lecher remarked, “if I 
didn’t fear I'd discharge.” 

After reviewing the three girls he wishes to review the four 
women; Palmire enchants him, never, says he, has he seen the like 
of her, and the lovely girl’s matchless ass has him dumbfounded 
and doting for ten minutes. 

Then he turns to me. “Instruct all these whores to get down 
on their knees in a semicircle around me; then to creep forward and 
pay their respects to my prick, and to suck it, one by one.” 

I give the order, it is carried out, and while each suckles his 
engine she receives a couple of smart slaps. 

‘““Well now,” says he, when that ceremony is over, “it’s my 
ass’s turn, have them approach one after the other and do it fitting 
worship and lick it.” 

Off they go to their new chore and while it is being done he 
sucks pricks, including, as you may well imagine, those of Cloris 
and Delcour. 

“The time has come, Juliette,” says he, “to end this first 
scene.” 

Whereupon the villain embuggers little Julie, the valets hold 
the mother and father while he bores and scrapes the child’s ass. 
Armed with a razor, Delcour steps up and prepares to sever 
her head. 


332 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Be in no hurry about it, Delcour,” he cries, “I want my be- 
loved niece to know what's happening to her, she’s not to die before 
I’ve done fucking her.” 

Delcour laid the cutting edge to skin and at once the child set 
up a ghastly wailing and screeching. 

“Proceed, proceed,” said Saint-Fond, well lodged in her ass, 
“but go softly, you’ve no idea the repercussions all this is having on 
my nervous system. Bend this way a little, Delcour, so that I can 
warm your member while you work. Juliette, pay your respects to 
Delcour’s ass, worship it; he’s become a god in my consideration. 
And bring the mother’s iss inside my reach, I want to kiss it while 
I have her daughter murdered.” 

But what were those kisses! Great God, they were bites so 
cruel the blood leapt forth at each. A valet embuggered him, the 
scoundrel’s ecstasy was urspeakable. 

“Ah, I savor crime, I do indeed,” he exclaimed, uttering many 
incoherent oaths, ‘“‘I adore crime, it bewitches me.” 

Delcour cuts with exquisite slowness. . . . Cloris is deathly 
pale, half in a swoon, he averts his horror-filled gaze. Julie’s beau- 
tiful head falls at last, like a rose that fmally yields to the unflagging 
north wind. 

“Than what I have just experienced there is probably nothing 
more voluptuous,” announces Saint-Fond, withdrawing from the 
cadaver, “’tis unimaginable, the constriction resulting in the anus 
from a gradual incision performed upon the nape vertebrae, it is 
delicious. All. right now, Madame, prepare to give me the same 
pleasure.” 

And the scene begins anew. Estimating that the operation is 
going ahead too rapidly, Saint-Fond suspends it. 

“I dare say they are few who realize,” he observes, “how 
heavenly it is to slice through the neck of a woman whom in your 
gigantic weakness you loved in days bygone. I am being very 
splendidly revenged upon ‘my cousin; it’s the sort of thing you 
are fain to have last for ever.” 

He continued frigging the headsman’s prick, but he would now 
kiss my buttocks; a valet tups him bumwise, another inserts in 
Delcour who resumes carving; the father has been adjusted so that 
I, armed with switches, «:an slash away at his privities. My ferocious 


Juliette = 333 


lover is in raptures, he feasts upon the slow sufferings of his 
relative, whose head is at last sundered fifteen minutes later. And 
now ’tis Cloris’ turn. He is placed in the position the operation 
demands, and bound. Saint-Fond sodomizes, the killer sets to work, 
valets yet embugger them both. This time it is Montalme’s magnif- 
cent behind Saint-Fond elects to kiss. The other women encircle 
him, displaying their asses; the bomb does finally burst. Heavens! 
if mighty Lucifer were to take it upon himself to discharge, me- 
thinks he’d unloose his seed less thunderously, would not foam 
so much at the mouth nor so gnash his teeth, at the gods would not 
hurl blasphemies and imprecations so fearful. While Saint-Fond 
remains behind, resting, I escort the seven women and the two 
valets into the next room. The Minister has soon rejoined us, but, 
like Wenceslas, his headsman is ever at his side; a few revels of a 
milder kind are, however, to precede the anthropophagical orgies 
of our latter-day Nero, and now for a space fuck is perhaps to flow 
before the bloodshedding resumes. 

Nonetheless, considering the man I was dealing with, it was 
necessary that I hew to the line laid down by his favorite pleasures : 
the voluptuous groups awaiting him had been disposed about in 
three alcoves decorated with all that is emblematic of Death. The 
entire room was hung in black, bones, skulls, a great store of rods, 
switches, withes, martinets, and knives were the furnitures; in each 
niche. a virgin was being cunt- -lapped by a Lesbian, both naked, re- 
posing upon black cushions, ‘and upon their brows wearing the skull 
and crossbones device. Within each niche one of the lately severed 
heads was plainly visible, and in front of these niches there were on 
the right a coffin, and to the left a little round table upon which lay 
a pistol, a goblet of poison, and a dagger; from somewhere (doubt- 
less from my desire to’please my lover) I had got the idea of 
sawing up the bodies of the three victims sacrificed a little before, 
gone was everything below mid-thigh and from the waist up, and 
cords depending from hooks sunk in the intercolumniations between 
the niches held these chunks of meat mouth-high. These were the 
objects Saint-Fond first caught sight of when he entered. 

‘‘My goodness,” sighed he after he’d kissed them all, ‘here 
they are again, and I’m most content to see them, these asses which 
recently gave me such delight.” 


334 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


A dim, a lugubrious lamp hung in the middle of the room 
whose vaults were likewise covered with dismal appurtenances; 
various instruments of torture were scattered here and there, 
among other objects one saw a most unusual wheel. It revolved 
inside a drum, the inner surface of which was studded with steel 
spikes; the victim, bent in an arc upon the circumference of the 
wheel, would, as it turned, be rent everywhere by the fixed spikes; 
by means of a spring device the drum could be tightened, so 
that, as the spikes grated flesh away, they could be brought closer 
and contact with the diminished mass maintained. This torture was 
the more horrible in as rauch as it was exceedingly gradual, and the 
victim might well endure ten hours of slow and appalling agony 
before giving up the ghost. To accelerate or slow the procedure one 
had but to decrease or widen the distance between the wheel and the 
compassing drum; this machine, of Delcour’s contriving, had not 
yet been essayed by Sain:-Fond; upon seeing it, he waxed very enthu- 
siastic and then and there gave its inventor a fifty-thousand-francs 
gratuity. From that moment on his single preoccupation was to 
choose her from.among the three victims who would be immolated 
in this manner; his perfidious gaze flitted from one girl to the next. 
Gods! the conclusion was foregone: the unlucky Fulvie, being the 
most beautiful, stood condemned in the tyrant’s heart, of this I 
was sure. A kiss he applied to that lovely creature’s asshole the 
moment he was done contemplating the terrible machine erased all 
doubt; but of all that in due time. 

Between Delcour and me, Saint-Fond first starts by settling 
himself in one after the other of the three armchairs which were 
placed one in front of each alcove. Palmire, of my women alone 
not employed in a nich», is posted behind his chair and is reaching 
around and polluting him; he is dandling Delcour’s prick and toying 
with my ass; and he scrutinizes the scene before him. Each tribade 
is mindful to ensure hin a good view of the body of the little girl 
she is frigging in every sector and in every possible manner and 
attitude; often, indeed, the child is brought to him so that he may 
kiss her in divers parts. He rises, goes to the next niche, then to the 
third; then comes back to the first; in the meantime Delcour flogs 
him; and now again he has somebody fuck him, and I suck him; I 
remark his device begirining to assume size and vibrancy; he embug-

gers me after a while (this occurred opposite the niche where 
Blaisine was toiling over Fulvie), it was then, as he was embracing 
that charming girl’s ass, he glanced aside at me and whispered in 
my ear, ‘‘That’s the one who’s to baptize the wheel. What a pretty 
tickling it’ll give those delectable little buttocks.” 

This preliminary examination completed, he lays himself down 
on a kind of narrow upholstered bench, and then begins a veritable 
parade; all those present, male and female, file up and one by one 
straddle the bench, squat over his face, and shit into his mouth. 
Palmire steps first to the fore, and when she has eased herself she 
kneels down beside his Lordship, takes his prick in her mouth, and 
sucks on it throughout the rite. Next, Montalme and I present 
ourselves simultaneously in order that he be able, as he so desires, 
to handle one ass while the other is yielding. From nastiness the 
libertine moves straight to horrors; he gives Delcour instructions 
to flog the seven women, and I rub his prick upon the heads he has 
had me detach for this purpose. 

After that three tableaux take form before his eyes: my two 
fuckers embugger two of my tribades; in the center, Delcour flogs 
the third; at the foot of each group reclines one of the little girls 
Saint-Fond is to depucelate, and for this task he is now getting 
himself in readiness: Palmire and I are arraying him for fight, she 
by socratizing him, I by means of prick-friggery. Rampant, the 
libertine shivers the three forward pucelages, turns Fulvie over 
and sinks his lance in her bum and discharges. I suck his weapon to 
restore it to true and temper; he would have the headsman hold 
for him all the women, not excepting me; to each of us he applies 
two hundred strokes; then it is he who holds the women and bids 
Delcour embugger them all. While Delcour is performing, the 
Minister kisses them upon the mouth during all the scene, in which 
I figure too. 

Then Saint-Fond led each maiden away into a remote chamber 
and passed a brief interval with her alone. We do not know what he 
told them, nor what he did; nor dared we even question them when 
they were brought back. In all likelihood he apprised them of 
their impending deaths, for each returned weeping from the inter- 
view. While Saint-Fond’s consultations were in progress Delcour 
indicated to me that a certain subtle lubricious byplay ordinarily 


336 @ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


followed this announcement; and that since the outset of his 
acquaintance with the Minister, he, Delcour, had always observed 
that pronouncing sentence left his Lordship overwhelmed by a 
sweet and mysterious anguish. Such was now the case, for he came 
back profoundly agitated, flushed, and marvelously erected.’ 

“Very well,” said he, rubbing his hands together, lust’s froth 
on his lips, “‘let’s take counsel. How shall we do them to death? 
Their agonies must be frightful, you understand, indescribable. 
Delcour, my lad, cudgel your wits, I expect you to outdo yourself 
in inventiveness: these poor swine are to endure one after the other 
all of hell’s tortures, it will desolate me if they get away with less.” 

And so saying he zave Fulvie a warm kiss; it was very ob- 
viously she who most aroused him. 

“Delcour,” he went on, “let me recommend this pretty little 
thing to you; she’ll look stunning on your wheel, those plump white 
buttocks were made for its spikes.” 

Wherewith he sank. his teeth into her, bit her in half a dozen 
places, drawing blood from each; one of those bites cost her the 
nipple off her left teat, and the roguish Minister swallowed it. He 
popped his prick into her asshole for a moment, then plucked it 
out again, got hold of Delcour’s engine, and rammed it into the 
vent he’d vacated. 

“The executioner must fuck his victim,” said he, “protocol 
demands it.” 

While Delcour was complying, Saint-Fond’s fingernails raked 
and tore the child’s buttocks, thighs, breasts, and he lapped up the 
blood as he made it flow; he had Palmire come forward, Palmire 
for whom, it appeared, he also had a prodigious weakness, and he 
said to her, “Behold, ‘tis thus I treat little girls who stiffen my 
tool.” 

Those words were scarce out of his mouth when he drove the 
selfsame tool into her ass: after some bucking and heaving he had 
her clamber upon a chair so he could proceed with her buttocks in 
better view; and beside her he had Délie take the same stance; then 
the three girls ranged themselves in a semicircle around him; they 
knelt; and he molested their bosoms while Blaisine frigged his. 


10 Further light will be shed upon these strange matters.

prick. He ran pins into those three unfortunates’ still but half- 
formed breasts, with a penknife he gashed them, then immediately 
brought a hot iron into play and cauterized the wounds. And I? I 
was busy keeping his excitement at a pitch, having, pursuant to 
his orders, Delcour’s prick in my bowels and the prick of a valet in 
either hand. With cords the Minister bound the kneeling three into 
a compact group, their backs together, and with a martinet whose 
steel tips were arrowheads, edged as well as pointed, made a very 
hash of their mammaries; throughout these pageantries Palmire’s 
ass was constantly there wherever he looked; taking respite from 
his labors, he many times flung himself upon it and sucked it 
to recover strength. 

“No dallying,” said he. rising up again, ‘‘set the stage. We'll 
have some more of the whip.” 

The seven women—I was left out—were tied to specially 
constructed columns; in their upraised hands they each held a 
crucifix; also upon crucifixes the four tribades were standing, and 
seemingly treading them contemptuously under foot; while the 
three victims fourid support upon cannonballs studded with nails all 
over, in such wise that their feet were lacerated owing to the weight 
of their bodies. The victims were cinctured around the breast by a 
leather strap, first wet, and as it dried, shrinking ever tighter; a 
device impended above the head of each and Saint-Fond, controlling 
a small crank, could bring its needle-sharp point down so that it 
penetrated to whatever depth desired into the cranium of the girl; 
other instruments, these .resembling two-tined forks and likewise 
needle-pointed, and also controlled by Saint-Fond, were aimed at 
their eyes; yet another point was there to receive their navels in the 
event that, jostled by the blows of the whip, they might perchance 
slip forward; and each of the victims, arranged as I have said, was 
flanked by tribades, who were free of all such intricate harnesses. 

Saint-Fond at first uses the switches Delcour and I hand over 
to him; he metes out a hundred strokes to each victim and deals 
each tribade fifty; the second round sees the steel-tipped martinet in 
service, each victim is favored with two hundred blows thereof, 
each tribade with a mere dozen. Then Saint-Fond starts his 
machineries working; the poor children, pricked in this place and 
that, set up a clamor such as would have melted the heart of any 


’ 


338 <2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


villain made of less stern stuff than we. Sensing a mounting irrita- 
tion in his prick, whence fuck is already oozing, Saint-Fond quickly 
has Louise brought to him, that Louise, sixteen years old, whom he 
has singled out to be executed first. Much does he kiss her, lick and 
fondle her bleeding ass, give her his prick to suck and his asshole; 
then turns her over to Delcour who, once he has slipped his goad 
into both her orifices, fastens her down upon a long table and sub- 
jects her to that Chinese torture which consists in being chopped up 
alive, by less than inches, into twenty-four thousand pieces. Saint- 
Fond, seated on the lap of the lackey fucking him, assists at the 
spectacle, and between his thighs grips Helene, next on the list and 
whose ass he molests while I frig him and he tongues Palmire’s 
mouth. The torture used upon the second consists in having her eyes 
gouged out and after that of being spread on a Saint Andrew’s 
cross and broken alive. Saint-Fond attends to the matter while I 
thrash him. All the victim’s limbs are broken, all her joints pulled 
loose; in that state she is offered to him again, he embuggers her 
and while he instruments her anus, Delcour finishes her off with a 
mace, dashing out her b-ains so that they fairly splatter into Saint- 
Fond’s mouth and eyes. 

The charming Fulvie alone remains, surrounded by the gory 
vestiges of her two companions; can she be in doubt of her fate? 
Saint-Fond points to the wheel. 

‘Look there,” says the Minister, “I’ve saved the best for you.” 

And the traitor does not fail to caress her and to kiss her 
tenderly upon the lips; yet again he embuggers her before delivering 
her to the killer. Delcour has her now; hideous are her screams; 
she is fitted into positicn, fastened there, and the wheel begins to 
turn. Fucked now by one valet, now by the other, Saint-Fond sounds 
Delcour’s ass while alternately kissing Palmire’s behind and mine, 
and in a detached and fugitive manner fingering the three un- 
occupied assholes. Very soon the ascending volume and tone of the 
victim’s screams give us report of her pain. Violent you may be 
certain it was; judge thereof by this detail: the blood was coming 
from her like one of those fine rains blown almost to mist by a 
strong wind. Saint-Fond, eager to prolong the game to the utmost, 
varies his tableaux and his festive doings too. He embuggers my 
four tribades in swift succession, while we all, Delcour included, 


Juliette <% 339 


compose new groups for him. The spike-surfaced drum, ever con- 
tracting, begins to attack the nerves, and the cries of the victim 
are stilled as overwhelmed by suffering she faints away; and that’s 
the very moment when Saint-Fond, weary of horrors and cruelty, 
finally unleashes his fuck into Palmire’s superb ass while he 
gamahuches Delcour’s, palpates mine with one hand and Mont- 
alme’s with the other, watches one of the valets embugger Blaisine 
on the floor beside the fatal wheel, and is whipped by Delie who also 
sucks his tongue to hasten his discharge. 

Saint-Fond’s shrieks, his disport, his foul, ungodly language 
were all appalling; he was only half-conscious when we bore him 
to the bed where, he nevertheless gave me to understand, he wished 
to have me pass the night at his side. 

This peerless libertine, quite as though he had just performed 
wonders of charity, enjoyed ten hours of blissful undisturbed 
sleep. I watched his rest; and if I had doubted it before, I was 
convinced now that it is easy to build oneself a conscience to sort 
evenly with one’s opinions, and that after the initial effort has been 
made, nothing afterward stands in one’s way. Oh, my friends, be- 
lieve me when I say that he who has succeeded in ridding his heart 
of every idea and trace of God or religion, he whose gold or influ- 
ence removes him beyond the reach of the law, he who has tough- 
ened his conscience and brought it firmly into line with his attitudes 
and cleared it utterly and forever of guilty remorse; he, I say, and 
be certain thereof, he may do whatever he pleases and whenever, , 
and never know an instant’s fear. 

When he woke up, the Minister asked me if it were not true 
that he was the wickedest man in the world. Knowing the pleasure 
I would give by answering in the affirmative, I did not by any means 
contradict him; and he smiled. 

“You flatter me.” 

“Do I? It is sincere.” 

“I rather suppose so. Ah, my angel,” said he, yawning, 
“could it be otherwise with me? Is it my fault if this is how I am, 
and if Nature put the most irresistible taste for vice in me, and not 
so much as a hint of a bent for virtue? Don’t you agree that I 
serve her quite as well as some other in whom she ingrained a fond- 
ness for doing good deeds? That seems self-evident to me; and

this likewise, that there would be no greater folly than willfully 
to cross her purpose as it regards us individually; I am the poison- 
ous plant she makes grow by the balsam tree, and find my manner 
of being no more to be regretted than I would esteem enviable 
that of the virtuous man; and once we realize that upon earth 
there must be the bitter together with the better, can it make one 
jot of difference to us whether we are numbered in this category or 
that? Imitate me, Juliette,"’ your native leanings are in this direc- 
tion: let no criminal act daunt you, the more atrocious it is, the 
more pleasing to Nature; guilt ? The only guiltiness is in reluctance, 
in backhanging; lift up your head, beloved girl, and go ever for- 
ward. To the dreary mediocre portion of mankind leave all notions 
and prattle such as that righteousness and modesty must accompany 
fleshly pleasure, they'll fail utterly of it every time. For it cannot 
possibly delect save whe. one outsteps every limit in one’s quest; the 
proof thereof is that there must be a breaking of restraining rules 
before pleasure begins to be pleasure; go farther yet, break still 
another and the irritation becomes more violent, and necessarily so 
with each ascending step; and you do not really attain to the true 
goal whither these pleasure-takings point until the ferment of the 
senses has reached the extremest pitch, until you have got to the 
final limit of what our human faculties can endure, in such wise that 
your nerves are so prodigiously wrought upon that they are frayed 
as if to paralysis, smitren into a convulsion that resembles stand- 
still and shocked insensibility. He who also would know the whole 
wild power and all the magic of lubricity’s pleasures must thor- 
oughly well grasp that only by undergoing the greatest possible 
upheaval in the nervous system may he procure himself the drunken 
transport he must have if he is properly to enjoy himself. For what 
is pleasure ? Simply this: that which occurs when voluptuous atoms, 
or atoms emanated from voluptuous objects, clash hard with and 
fire the electrical particles circulating in the hollows of our nerve 

11 Hot-blooded and lewdly disposed ladies, these are words to the wise, hark at- 
tentively to them: they are addressed not only to Juliette but to yourselves also; if 
your intelligence is in any sense comparable to hers, you'll not fail to extract great 
benefit from them. In writing we are moved by an ardent desire for your happiness; 


a happiness you'll never attain, no, never shall you attain it, unless you base your

fibers. Therefore, that the pleasure be complete, the clash must be 
as violent as possible; but so delicate is the nature of this sensa- 
tion that a mere nothing can spoil or nullify it; hence, the soul 
must be prepared, tranquil, its serenity ensured by certain mental 
attitudes or certain physical postures, so that it lies as though in a 
calm and smiling vale; and then the imagination’s fire must set the 
furnace of the senses alight. From this point onward give that 
imagination free rein, act at its every behest, its every whim; and 
labor not only to grant it what it desires but, by making practical 
use of your philosophy and above all of the chill hardness of your 
heart and your lack of conscience, enable it to forge, to weave, to 
create new fantasies which, injecting energies into the voluptuous 
atoms, cause them to collide at greater speed and more potently 
with the molecules they are to make vibrate; these vibrations are 
your delight. From what I| have just said, you will appreciate, 
Juliette, how obstacles, exerting their restrictive influence upon the 
form of your delirium, will always tend to confine it within the 
boundaries of decency and virtue, thus altering its essence; upon 
your delirium obstacles of any sort have a dampening effect, water 
poured on fire; a hindering effect. so many chains, so many clogs 
encumbering the spirited young destrier that asks only to take the 
bit in its mouth and break into a gallop. 

“In such cases, the impediment represented by religion is with- 
out doubt the first that ought to be liquidated, being as it is a per- 
petual source of discomfort and remorse to anyone languishing in 
its grip; but combating superstition is only half the job, it will 
remain unfinished so long as the altars of a fantastical God are left 
standing. No, there’s not much to the former operation, neither a 
great deal of intelligence nor a great deal of brawn is needed to 
dispose of religion’s disgusting chimeras, since not one of them can 
hold up under examination. But that’s not the end to it, Juliette, 
not by any means, there are countless other duties, other social 
conventions, other barriers which will soon become as much a 
nuisance to you as religion was, if, bold and independent of mind, 
you do not make it a rule to thrust aside anything that lies in your 
path. Just as hampered by these contemptible restraints, you'll 
soon discover them interfering with your pleasures equally as much 
as his belief interferes with the believer’s; if, on the contrary, you 


342 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


have ridden roughshod cver everything in order to attain pleasure, 
and if you have protected your rear by taming your conscience and 
lulling it nicely off to sleep, then, in this other case, there is no 
doubt but that your enjoyment will be as intense and complete as 
anything Nature allows of; and such will be your frenzy that its 
excessive consequences will be all if not more than your physical 
faculties can endure. Nevertheless, do not expect to be as happy in 
the beginning as, by dint of persistence, you shall be later on; no 
matter what you do to counter them, prejudices will continue a 
long while to harass you, and the more severely the more formi- 
dable the obstacles you surmount: baneful, fatal effects of education, 
for which the only remedy is deep thought, indefatigable persever- 
ence, and entrenched habits especially. 

“But little by little-—my intention is not to discourage you— 
little by little your mind will become fortified; habit, that second 
nature which sometimes becomes more powerful than first, which 
is at length able to annihilate those very natural principles that 
seem the most invulnerable, the most sacred, this habit that is 
essential to vice, that I cannot too strongly urge you to acquire, and 
upon which success in the career you have chosen depends; this 
habit, I say, will dull your remorse, quell it, silence your conscience, 

put a stop to the silly bleating that comes from the heart; and then 
you'll see things in a very different light indeed. Amazed at the 
fragility of the bonds that held you captive once, you'll look with 
a certain regret, yes, with a certain nostalgia back upon the days 
when, stupidly ensnared. innocently, you were able to resist pleas- 
ures; and though a few paltry obstacles may have got in the way of 
your felicity, the charm of having known it, and the divine memories 
you will have of it, will cause the thorns they wished to strow in 
- your path to appear as very flowers. Well now, in the circumstances 
where I have placed you, with the security I guarantee you, what 
have you to fear? Reflect a moment upon your marvelous situation; 
and if the certainty of getting off scot-free’ furnishes crime its 
divinest allurements, who in all the world is better placed than you 
to enjoy yourself to death? Consider now your other advantages: 
eighteen years, perfect health, the prettiest face, the noblest figure, 
all the wit one could ask for, intelligence, the temperament of a 
Messalina, the riches virtually of a Croesus, a splendid reputation,

no handicaps, no chains, no relations, friends who adore you... 
and you're afraid of the law? Put by your fears forever; if some 
day the sword of justice is bared against you, Juliette, protect 
yourself with the shield of your wiles and winningness; instead of 
this languor where you lie becalmed in a sea of voluptuous delights, 
adopt another mood, put on seductive raiments, show yourself 
about, and crowds will fall at your feet; bestir yourself and a 
kneeling world will provide you with ten thousand champions, 
they will shed their blood to the last drop defending the name of 
their most cherished idol and to keep it pure; ten thousand hearts 
will beat for you, and where others would have judges to dread 
you'll find none but devoted lovers. Let the isolated, the friendless, 
the penniless individual, he who counts for nought, who scarce has 
an identity, let him groan under vulgar yokes; they were designed 
for him only. But you, Juliette, ah! hurl all Nature into confusion, 
wreak havoc, destroy, rend the whole universe asunder; men will 
consider your anger godlike and do you divine worship if per- 
chance you deign to smile upon the world, whensoever you cast a 
crumb of kindness to it; and will dread you when in wrath you 
trample upon it; but it is all one, whatever you do, you'll always be 
God to the common sort and mass of humankind. 

“Indulge yourself, oh, my Juliette, without fear, proudly 
surrender to the impetuosity of your tastes, to the irregularity of 
your caprices, to the blazing ardor of your desires; your wanton- 
ness is my cheer, your pleasures my joy; be ever guided by them, 
ruled by them and by nothing else; may your voluptuous imagina- 
tion ensure variety to our disorders; only by multiplying them will 
we attain happiness. Happiness being an intrinsically fickle and 
fugitive thing, it confers its blessing only upon him who is clever 
to mark it, quick to seize it, strong to hold it; and never lose sight 
of the fact that all human felicity lies in man’s imagination, and 
that he cannot think to attain it unless he heeds all his caprices. 
The most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to 
satisfy his vagaries: get ye girls, men, children; upon all those in 
your entourage direct the lasciviousness of your impassioned soul ; 
whatever delights is good, whatever arouses is natural. 

“Do you not see the star that lights us sometimes give life 
and sometimes take it away, now vivifying, now withering to dust?

Match the sun in thy conduct as thou dost figure it in thy fair 
eyes. Take Messalina and Theodora for thy models; like those 
famous whores of antiquity, supply thyself with harems of either 
sex wherein thou canst plunge conveniently and when thou wilt into 
a very ocean of filthiness. Wallow in ordure and infamy; let all 
that is of the dirtiest and the most execrable, of the most shame- 
ful and the most criminzl, of the most cynical and the most repul- 
sive, of the most unnatural, illegal, irreligious, be for those very 
reasons that which dost please thee most. Soil without stint and at 
leisure the loveliest parts of thy body, remember that there is not 
a one where lubricity may not find a shrine, and that the divinest 
pleasures are unfailing'y those whereat thou perhaps suppose 
Nature vexed. When the most odious of debauchery’s excesses, 
when the most depraved turpitudes, when the most disgusting 
activities begin to pall upon thee and leave thee listless, have resort 
to cruelties, they reanimate; the most ghastly and fell deeds, the 
most revolting atrocitics, the most unimaginable and nameless 
crimes, the most gratuitous horrors, the most monstrous perversi- 
ties, let these be the means to convey thy soul from the lethargy 
where libertinage may hive left it. Nor forget that Nature is thine 
ally and sanction; that whatever she lets us do is permissible; and 
that when she created us she was cunning enough to withhold 
from us the power and possibility of doing her injury. Thou shalt 
then notice Love sometimes maketh his arrows into daggers, and 
that for bringing our fuck to flow the invectives of the doomed one 
we torment often outvalue the polite gallantries of Cythera.” 

Deeply moved by Saint-Fond’s speech, I ventured to indicate 
that my sole fear was of the possibility his kindness to me might 
come to an end. 

“Juliette,” he gave ne answer, “you'd have fallen out of grace 
a good while before this had I merely been your lover; for, how- 
ever beautiful she may be, the favors of a woman cannot exert 
prise upon me for long. He unto whom it is a principle that the 
instant one has finished fucking a woman is the instant when it is 
essential to be finished with her, must of a certainty, if he is only a 
lover, inspire such an eventuality as causes you to worry; but 
Juliette, and hereof I need hardly remind you, there is precious 
little of the vulgar amorist in me; both of us bound by similarities 


Juliette eb 345 


of taste, intellect, outlook, and self-interest, I apprehend our 
attachment as one forged out of egoism alone, and that kind endures 
forever. Would I advise you to fuck . Sroad if I were your lover? 
No, Juliette, no, that I am not, such I shall never be. Hence dread 
no change of heart in me; if ever I quit you it will be you the cause 
of our separation, only you. Maintain your good behavior, I tell 
you, be active in the service of my pleasures; let not a moment go 
by when I do not develop some new vice in you or further refine 
an old one; while we are at home, show me submissiveness carried 
to the last degree of baseness, the lower you crawl cringingly at 
my feet, the higher I, from pride, shall set you above others, 
above all, whatsoever may be the thing I require you to do, do it 
without ever displaying any weakness, any hint of contrition, and 
I shall render you the happiest of women as you shall render me 
the luckiest of men.” 

“Oh, my master,” said I, “be ever sure that if I would reign 
over the world, it is to bring it on its bended. knees in homage to 
you.” 

Next we left off generalities to discuss certain particulars. 
Saint-Fond expressed regret at not having been able to subject his 
niece to the wheel; which, said he, he would definitely have done 
were he not under obligation to produce her head in Paris. Then 
he spoke in very great praise of Delcour. 

“He is full of imagination,” said the Minister. ‘He is young 
and vigorous besides, and I must compliment you upon having de- 
sired his prick. For my own part, it is always a delight to fuck him. 
In passing let me remark that, as I have often had occasion to ob- 
serve, the same man you fucked in your youth can yet be fucked 
pleasurably when you are forty. We are alike, aren’t we Juliette?” 
he went on. “As did I, you took a fancy to him on account of his 
trade; were it not for that, neither of us would have paid him the 
slightest attention.” . 

“Have you had many such fellows?” I asked Saint-Fond. 

“For five or six years they were my specialty,” he replied, 
‘I combed the provinces to get hold of them; and I had an incred- 
ible leaning toward their valets. You simply cannot imagine what 
it’s like to have the prick of a headsman’s valet in your ass; after 
a time though, I found something equivalent in butchers’ boys. 


346 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Often I’d pass two hours being embuggered by one of those lads 
come fresh from his slaughtering and bloody all over.” 

“Adorable,” said I. 

“Beyond words so,”’ said he. ‘Ah yes, my dear, believe me, 
those stunts call for infamy and depravation; and what the devil is 
lust, if crapulousness is not therein as its very soul? By the way,” 
the Minister continued, “one of those tribades has an appalling 
effect upon my nerves—I refer to the pretty blonde, the whom, I 
think, obtained the last of my fuck.” 

‘“‘Palmire ?”’ 

“Yes, twas doubtless so I heard you call her. Her ass was the 
fairest, its hole the narrowest, the warmest of the lot. . .. How did 
yOu gain possession of the wench?” 

“She was working a: a dressmaker’s, was just turned eighteen 
when I found her and as :nint as a babe emerging from its mother’s 
womb; Palmire is an orphan. She comes of a good line, and has no 
parents save an elderly aunt who gave me an excellent character of 
the girl.” 

“Do you love her, Juliette?” 

“Saint-Fond, I don’t love anything. I am moved by caprice 
only.” 

: “I feel this pretty creature lacks absolutely nothing of what is 
needed to make a delicious victim; undeniably she is beautiful, it 
is quite certain she would be yet more so in distress, she has magnif- 
cent hair, a sublime ass whose qualities are indeed outstanding. 
..» Here, Juliette, dost see how my prick soars at the thought of 
martyrizing her?” 

Truly, never had [ seen his prick,in such high wrath, I 
clutched it and set to frigging it softly. 

“But if I take her,” he added, “I'll pay you well, I’ll pay you 
a better price for her than for another, since I desire her.” 

“To my understanding, does not that word have the meaning 
and force of a command” Wouldst have her come in this instant?” 

“I would, for my prick is gone up for her.” 

Saint-Fond, flinging a dressing robe about himself, sprang 
toward Palmire as she came into the room and, taking her firmly 
by the arm, disappeared with her into ahother chamber: long, 
arduous was the séance; I could hear Palmire’s screams. An hour 


Juliette <& 347 


elapsed before they returned. As he had made her undress before 
leading her off to that secret lair, the first thing that caught my eye 
when she reappeared was the extent to which she had been mis- 
treated; and even if her body had not been naked, the tears still 
coursing down her cheeks would have been sufficient evidence. It was 
but too superfluously confirmed by the marks on her breasts and 
buttocks. 

“Juliette,” declared her tormentor, visibly overwrought by 
what he had just accomplished, “it breaks my heart but I simply 
do not have enough time for this: those blasted heads must be 
delivered to the Queen by five this afternoon, which means I'll not 
be able to amuse myself with this girl in the manner I'd like. Not 
today at least. So this is my suggestion. Have her present the day 
after tomorrow at our next three-girl supper. Until then, prison her 
safely in the darkest and best-barred of your dungeon cells; I 
forbid you to allow her any nourishment or drink, and order you 
to fetter her so closely to the wall she will be able neither to sit 
down nor even to stir. Do not question her about what has just now 
passed; I have my own reasons for preferring to keep you in 
ignorance thereabout. For this Palmire you will receive double the 
customary fee. Farewell.” 

So saying, he and Delcour, the latter carrying the box con- 
taining the three heads, mount Saint-Fond’s coach; it drives away; 
and I, keenly agitated, remain rooted to the spot. 

I had a great fondness for Palmire. Very loath I was to 
surrender her to that cannibal; but could I disobey? Daring not 
even to speak to her, I had her taken off to the dungeon; and 
scarcely was she there when two sentiments assailed me. The first 
was a desire to save this girl, of whom I was still far from being 
weary; the second revolved around an extreme curiosity to discover 
just how Saint-Fond proceeded with women upon whom he pro- 
nounced capital senterice. Ceding to this latter desire, I was about to 
start down to interrogate the captive when a servant ushered in 
Madame de Clairwil. 

Several days earlier she had seen the Minister and learned 
from him the time of his return from the country; and now she 
had come to ask whether I would not care to drive back with her 
to Paris and to see a charming ballet at the Opéra. I embraced my 


348 <e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


friend most warmly; I related to her all we had lately achieved, 
Saint-Fond and I; the follies I'd committed before the Minister’s 
arrival, I spoke also of hem, and of all the others that had ensued. 
The dear creature found my stories delicious and congratulated me 
upon the progress I was beginning to make in crime. When I 
alluded to what was afoot regarding Palmire, Clairwil raised a 
cautioning hand. 

“Juliette,” said she, “beware. Banish all thoughts of cheating 
the Minister of his victim, and above all of prying into his obscure 
ways; be rather mindful that your fate depends upon this man, and 
that the pleasure you might derive from discovering his secret, or 
from preserving your slut’s life, will never console you for the woes 
that will unfailingly beset you do you act the fool. You'll find ten 
score girls worth more than this one; and as for Saint-Fond’s 
secret, knowledge of cne piece of infamy more or less is not 
going to make you happier. Let’s dine, my beloved, and then hasten 
back to the city; it will distract you.” 

By six o’clock we were en route, Clairwil, Elvire, Montalme, 
and I; the team of six English horses had us flying swift as the wind 
and we would surely have arrived in time for the opening of 
the ballet, when but a little out of the village of Arcueil we met 
with four men, who were mounted and had pistols in their hands. 
Night had fallen. Our lackeys, effeminate, craven fellows, fops 
almost, ran off as fast as their legs could carry them, and, save 
only for the two coachmen, we were left to confront the four 
masked riders alone. 

Clairwil, who knew not the meaning of fear, singled out him 
who looked to be the ringleader and, addressing him in an imperi- 
ous tone, demanded what he fancied he was about; not a word did 
he reply. Our drivers were ordered to turn the coach about, we 
proceeded back away ir the direction of Arcueil, then climbed to 
Cachan, and swung off into a narrow road which at length brought 
us to a lonely fortified castle. The coach entered, the gates closed, 
we even heard them being barricaded from within; thereupon one 
of our escorts opened the door of the coach and silently offered 
his hand, inviting us to step out. 

My knees buckled as I got down from the coach, I was close to 
fainting away, for indeed I was dreadfully afraid; my women were 


Juliette a 349 


in no better case; only Clairwil was undaunted. Head high, lips 
compressed, she bade us take courage. Three of our ravishers dis- 
appeared; their captain led us into a well-lit drawing room. There, 
our eyes were greeted by the sight of an old man: he was weeping, 
and two very pretty young ladies were endeavoring to console him. 
“‘Mesdames, these persons gathered here,’ pronounced our 
guide, who had now been rejoined by his three fellows, “are all 
that remain of the Cloris family. The old gentleman is the father 
of the husband, these two ladies are the sisters of his wife, and we 
are his brothers. The head of this house, his wife and daughter 
too, are missing; false charges were brought against them, through 
no fault of their own they incurred Her Majesty’s displeasure and, 
worse yet, the wrath of that Minister who owes his place and 
fortune to none other than my brother’s generosity and aid. En- 
quiries we rapidly made led us to the conviction that these three 
persons, of whom there has been nothing heard since the day before 
yesterday, are being held prisoner, or are dead, in the country 
house you left this same evening. You belong to the Minister; one 
of you is his mistress, this we know. You shall either guide us to 
the recovery of the three we seek, or persuade us that they are no 
longer alive; until then, you shall remain our hostages. Restore 
our relatives to us and you go free; but if they have been murdered, 
then you shall be with them in the grave very shortly, and your 
shades shall implore theirs for forgiveness. Beyond this we have 
nothing to say to you; now ’tis your turn to speak. Be quick.” 
“‘Messieurs,” answered the brazen Clairwil, “it would appear 
to me that your doings are in every sense profoundly illegal. I would 
also qualify them as exceedingly clumsy. For consider: to begin 
with, is it likely that two women, madame and myself—these others 
are our servants—is it at all likely, I say, that two women be so 
well acquainted with the Minister’s private affairs as to have any 
knowledge of such happenings as you refer to? Do you really 
suppose that if the persons in question have fallen into disgrace at 
Court, and that Justice or the Minister has been called upon to 
take action; do you honestly believe that we would have been made 
privy to any such execution? You know when we departed from the 
Minister’s house, you doubtless know when we arrived; does not 
our presence under his roof during the last few days most con- 


350 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


clusively prove that the event could not have transpired there? 
For the rest, gentlemen, we have nought but our word of honor to 
give you, but we offer it as guaranty of our total ignorance of what 
may have befallen those after whose fate you ask. No, gentlemen, 
no, we do declare to you that we have never even heard tell of these 
people until now, and if you are just men, and have no more to say 
to us, put us at our liberty this instant, for it is against our will 
you detain us here, and vou have not the right to do so.’ 

‘We shall not amuse ourselves refuting you, Madame,” our 
guide replied. ‘One of you has been four days upon the Minister’s 
estate, the other arrived there late this afternoon. It was also four 
days ago the Cloris faraily entered that same house; of you two, 
one is most assuredly in a position to answer the questions I have 
posed, and you have neither of you any chance of being released 
until we are fully enlighvened.” 

Whereupon the th-ee other horsemen declared that since: we 
were not eager to speak of our own free will, there were ways of 
extracting information from us by force. 

“Ah, my sons, that I would not have,” said the old man, ‘“‘no 
violence shall be done here. We must eschew our enemies’ means lest 
we be likewise guilty of an evil. We shall merely request these 
ladies to compose a letter to the Minister, asking him to come to 
this house forthwith; ard the message may be so styled as to give 
him the impression that they, and they alone, are soliciting his 
presence for business of the greatest urgency. He will come; we 
shall question him; he will finally have no choice but to tell us where 
my son and daughter ae: for if he refuses, this hand, trembling 
though it is, shall find tie strength to thrust a knife-point into his 
heart. . . . Wicked abuses of tyranny! Dire results of despotism! 
O people of France, when shall you rise up against these horrors? 
When, tired of slavery and conscious of your tremendous might, 
when shall you look boldly up and snap the chains with which 
crowned criminals keep you in bondage, when shall you reclaim the 
freedom whereunto Nature destined you? .. . Put pen and ink and 
paper before these ladies and let them write.” 

“Keep them amused,” I whispered to Clairwil, ‘occupy their 
attentions and leave the letter to me.” 

This was the text: ‘‘An affair of the very extremest importance 


” 


Juliette %& 351 


necessitates your presence here; the bearer of this note will guide 
you, come with the utmost dispatch.” 

I submit the letter to our captors, they approve it. While 
addressing the envelope I find a moment to scribble this postscript: 
“Rush hither in force, else we're lost; it is perforce the foregoing 
is indited.”’ The missive is sealed, one of the brothers leaves with 
it, and we are introduced into a room in an upper story; the door is 
bolted, and another brother stands guard without. 

No sooner were we alone than I told Clairwil what I had 
appended to the letter. 

She shook her head. ‘“That does not suffice to set my mind at 
rest,” said she. “For if he comes here in force, these people have 
but to see that force and our throats are cut. What if we try to 
seduce our jailer?” - 

“We'll fail,” I replied. ‘“These aren’t hired thugs. They are 
bound by honor, not to mention ties of blood, nothing will dissuade 
them from seeking their revenge. Ah, Clairwil, it does indeed seem 
to me that I have not yet got firm grasp of our principles, for in 
truth I do greatly fear lest some fatality or other, call it what you 
will, shall see virtue triumph in the end.” 

“Never. Never. Victory goes always to the stronger, and for 
strength crime has not its match. Such ideas betray an unpardonable 
weakness in you.” 

“This is my first reverse—” 

“Your second, Juliette. Let me refresh your memory: only 
after you emerged from a prison where you ought rather to have 
gone to the gallows did fortune begin to heap her favors upon you.” 

“True. I’d forgot that adventure.” 

“And its moral. Take courage, Juliette; be patient.” 

Nothing under the sun could have extinguished the fires of 
libertinage that burned at all times in this remarkable woman. 
There was but one bed in the room, and would you believe it? she 
suggested we all four of us get into it and while away the time 
frigging one another until Saint-Fond’s arrival. But as it turned out, 
neither I nor either of my women was in a sufficiently composed 
state to cooperate in her extravagances; and so we chatted instead 
as we awaited further developments. 

Like Clairwil, Monsieur de Saint-Fond considered that, we 


352 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


being prisoners there, it were wiser not to storm the chateau; under 
such circumstances, the employ of ruse, he felt, ought to precede 
that of violence, and this was the stratagem he used. 

The rider who had gone out with our letter returned with two 
youths. unknown to us; they brought Cloris’ father a message, it 
ran as follows: 

“To hold women in an affair concerning men only is not be- 
fitting to gallantry. Free these ladies; in their stead, accept as 
hostages these young men, one my first cousin, the other my nephew; 
you may believe that their safety is more precious to me than that 
of the women now in your power. As well, put aside all fear regard- 
ing your own loved ones; they are indeed under detention, but here 
at my house in Paris; consider me responsible for them; and I vow 
to you they shall be in vour midst within the space of three days. 
Again I say to you, keep my kinsmen and let the women go their 
way; I myself shall be at your house four hours after this reaches 
you.” 

Here we had to usz our wits very cleverly. The note was not 
read out to us, it was not until later we learned its exact contents; 
for the moment we could only guess its drift. 

“Are you acquairted with these young gentlemen?” old 
Cloris asked me. 

‘Most certainly,” said I, “they are related to the Minister; if 
they have come to subsritute themselves for us, you couldn’t have 
better hostages.” 

They were discussing whether to set us at large or no when one 
of our captors spoke up: ‘‘This may be a trap; whatever, I am 
against letting the women out of our hands. Why not keep them all ? 
That means two hostages the more.” 

To this the others agreed, and the fools (for pursuant to the 
design of things, virtue can lead nowhere but to folly), the stupid 
clods, the animals, shut 11s all inside the same room. 

“Be assured, Mesdames,” said one of the Minister’s alleged 
relatives, ‘‘we are here to help you. Those are our instructions; two 
hours from now, the entire body of the Paris police—to which we 
belong—shall have the chateau surrounded: we shall protect you 
during the siege. We are well armed, never fear; and were these 


Juliette % 353 


people, finding they have been tricked, to decide to attempt any- 
thing against you, you shall be defended.” 

“My one fear,” Clairwil remarked, “is that these idiots wake 
up to the fact they have made a mistake in putting us all together. 
We shall be helpless if they separate us.” 

“Very well,” said I, much more at ease than I had been 
hitherto, ‘‘we have simply to unite ourselves inseparably.” 

“What,” Clairwil declared, “you who but a moment ago 
shuddered at the mention of a roughly similar distraction, do you 
now dare broach the idea ?” 

“Why, I’ve grown much calmer,” I replied, “and, Clairwil, 
these two lads are both very pretty to look upon.” 

One of them, Pauli by name, was in truth but twenty-three, 
and he had the gentlest face, the most delicate features in the 
world; the other was probably two years older, his appearance was 
effeminate but he was quite as handsome, and his prick was a verit- 
able splendor. 

“T am confident that these gentlemen are at our disposition,” 
said Clairwil; whereupon we fell to kissing our champions and 
caressing them with such ardor that we were soon able to read 
consent in their expressions. 

“Yes,” Clairwil resumed, “since they are so emphatically of 
our mind, this is how the thing should be gone about. Pauli is 
going to fuck you, Juliette; I'll be served by Laroche; when we’re 
both encunted, Elvire will frig my clitoris with one hand, my ass- 
hole with the other; Montalme will do the same to you. Both of 
them being within our fuckers’ reach, our fuckers will toy with 
them according to their fancy: you must not suppose that we'll lose 
by thus dividing our fuckers’ attentions, not at all, those attentions 
will be intensified, there’s nothing like this arrangement to keep 
a prick in size; all voluptuous women would be well advised to 
employ it. But let me proceed. Taking careful note of the sensations 
being experienced by our young studs, as soon as they observe them 
nearing discharge, Elvire and Montalme will deftly snatch these 
pricks out of our cunts and transfer them into our asses in order 
that no fuck be spent other than there; once both are discharged 
empty, we'll exchange man and wornan. But you and I, proximately 
placed, will be concerned with ourselves only: we shall kiss each 


354 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


other, we shall tongue each other, my love, and the while,” she 
added in a whisper, ‘‘we'll*watch these vile beings, these base 
drudges toiling to give us pleasure like so many slaves Nature has 
created to be our tools and whom we suffer to exist solely in the 
interest of our passions.”’ 

“Precisely,” I rejoined. ‘I do not understand how one can 
even hope to be aroused unless one holds that attitude.” 

And the very next instant there the two of us are, sprawled on 
the bed, our skirts pulled up above the navel, legs flung wide. First 
of all, the tribades seize each an engine, these we ready, steer into 
position, then engulf with our panting cunts. If Clairwil was briskly 
fucked by Laroche, certainly I had no cause to complain of Pauli; 
his member was not qui:e so thick as his colleague’s, but it was of 
goodly length, and I feit it stab to the final depths of my womb; 
frigged meanwhile in heavenly style by Montalme, voluptuously 
kissed by my friend, we had each passed through nerve-rending 
crises when the piece of legerdemain so skillfully executed by 
Montalme advised me of my young lover’s impending ejacula- 
tion; and then my thirsty ass was flooded by streams of nectar-sweet 
sperm. While it was pouring into me, the adroit Montalme probed 
three fingers into my lately vacated cunt and continued to rub my 
clitoris throughout. A loud shrill oath from my friend told me 
where matters stood with her; we were simultaneously whelmed by 
a third discharge as once again fuck washed abundantly into our 
entrails. 

‘Now we'll exchange,” said Clairwil, “try some Laroche 
while I take Pauli.” 

Both of them young, both vigorous, our athletes recommence 
their efforts without even asking to catch their breath, and I found 
myself being fucked by one of the most beautiful pricks imaginable. 

At that point Clairwil, who had gone on kissing me, tonguing 
me uninterruptedly, ignoring everybody else, paused to murmur in 
my ear: “I have something perfectly abominable in mind.” 

‘Ah, by fuck,” said I, “‘let’s to work. What would you do?” 

‘No. I want to surprise you,” she said. “Content yourself 
with knowing that this idea alone is flushine the whey out of my 
loins.” 

And therewith joy smote the rascal; her convulsions, her 


Juliette ed» 355 


thrashings would rather have chilled than gladdened her fucker 
had he been acquainted with their cause. Restored somewhat to her 
senses, still being fucked by Pauli, she spoke to me again, again in 
an undertone: “I think I’d better explain it-to you, else you won’t 
be able to play your part in the thing. There is going to be fighting; 
we Shall be attacked; we'll resist. I propose that we ask these young 
‘men for weapons, and, as thanks for all the services they’ve done 
for us, that we shoot them dead during the battle. Blame for these 
murders will be laid upon our enemies; and Saint-Fond, further 
impressed by the dangers you've run, will probably reward you 
that much more liberally.” 

“Oh, thrice-damned slut,” was my reply, discharging like a 
whore as Clairwil divulged this exciting scheme, “it’s good, good, 
what you advise.” 

As I spoke I oiled Laroche’s prick; and he, finding himself on 
the verge of another explosion, hastily decunted, burrowing into 
my bum at the same instant I discharged, which coincidence hurled 
me into transports such as I doubt my powers to describe, there 
being nothing, I affirm, absolutely nothing so delicious for a woman 
as to feel a prick penetrate her ass at the same instant she is over- 
taken by an orgasm. A brief moment later we heard gunfire outside; 
we all sprang up from the bed. 

“They've come,” says Clairwil; “give us pistols so that we can 
defend ourselves, my lads.” 

“Here you are,” says Laroche. ‘Each is loaded with three 
balls.” 

“Good,” Clairwil replies, “and be sure they'll be soon lodged 
in somebody’s heart.” 

The noise mounts, shouts ring out in the chateau: “To arms!” 

“See to the priming,” cries Laroche; “you ladies had best 
group yourselves behind us, we can act as a shield for you.” 

Things now began to happen very fast. Already driven back in 
the lower part of the chateau by the detachment sent from Paris, 
our captors raced up toward where we were, meaning to kill us 
before surrendering; but their assailants were hot on their heels. 
Our door was forced; the pistol-shots were deafening. Stationed 
behind our defenders, we chose this moment for ridding ourselves 
of the weight of gratitude. Two bodies lay in a welter of blood at 


356 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


our feet, and our cunts were yet slimed with the fuck of the young 
men our iniquity slew. Their deaths were of course ascribed to our 
captors; the officers in charge of our detachment lost little time 
revenging their murdered comrades. Olu Cloris and the young 
ladies alone remained al've: they were packed into a coach and, 
escorted by six of the policemen, were taken off to the Bastille. The 
rest of the police, having hitched the horses to our carriage, con- 
ducted us to my house, where I besought Clairwil to stay for supper. 

She agreed to do so; we scarce had seated ourselves in the 
drawing room when my butler announced Saint-Fond. 

I turned quickly to my friend. ‘Shall we tell him about our 
little horror?” 

“No.” She pursed her lips. ‘You must always do whatever 
you want. You must never tell all you’ve done.” 

The Minister entered, we declared ourselves thankful for the 
measures he had taken in our behalf. He in his turn declared that 
he was very sorry indeed a personal affair of his had caused us 
such inconvenience. 

“Eight men were kIled in the course of the thing, perhaps 
ten,” he informed us, ‘“‘::mong them the two lads I sent to you. 
It’s rather a pity about them.” 

“A pity?” Clairwil repeated. ‘“How so?” 

“Oh, I'd been fucking them both for quite a while, you know.” 

“Tush,” she chided “is this Saint-Fond we hear expressing 
pity for objects he’s fucked ?” 

“Merely regret at their loss. They were nimble boys, and 
wonderfully serviceable in my covert operations.” 

‘‘Never mind, there are many pebbles on the beach,” said I, 
showing Saint-Fond to his chair at table; “let’s forget about the 
slight harm that’s been done and talk instead about your successes.” 

During the meal the conversation as usual revolved around 
philosophical questions; afterward, the Minister having business to 
attend to, and we being exceedingly tired after a trying day, the 
company separated. At tke supper held on the morrow, my unlucky 
Palmire, fetched for the ‘ourpose to Paris from her dungeon in the 
country, was mercilessly sacrificed after enduring a thousand tor- 
tures, one more barbarous than the other. Saint-Fond obliged me 
to strangle her while he gave her an ass-fucking. For Palmire I got 


Juliette 357 


twenty-five thousand francs; a lively description of my perilous 
captivity in the chateau earned me twenty-five thousand more. 

The following two months were unattended by any event 
worth signaling. I had just celebrated my eighteenth birthday when 
Saint-Fond, visiting me at home one morning, told me he had been 
to see Madame de Cloris’ sisters at the Bastille; they were both, he 
considered, far prettier than she whom we had butchered; and 
indeed the younger of the two, who was my age, struck him as 
positively lovely. 

“So, my Lord,” I asked, “shall it be a trip into the country ?” 

“Yes, exactly,” was his reply. 

‘And the old man?” 

“Oh, some spice in his soup perhaps... . 

‘‘As you like, but that will mean the loss of three prisoners at 
one stroke, and you realize that the warden depends entirely upon 
them for his livelihood.” 

‘‘He won’t go hungry. Replacements are easy to come by.” 

“T should like you to put one of Clairwil’s relations first on the 
list. The creature in question has been playing the prude with our 
friend, to whose libertinage she has some strange objection. That 
leaves two vacancies to fill; I have candidates for them now, I’ll 
give you their names in a week.” 

“T'll have the documents in order,” said the Minister, ‘‘but 
one thing at a time.”’ He drew out a memorandum book and pen- 
ciled a note: “Gentleman: lunch. Ladies: outing.” Whereupon he 
looked up at me and smiled. ‘Off you go tomorrow, Juliette. Take 
Clairwil along; she’s charming and for imaginativeness has no 
peer. We'll contrive something delicious.” 

“Shall you require men and tribades?” 

“No, I think not. Private scenes are sometimes preferable to 
orgies: the narrower stage is more favorable to meditation, more 
conducive to horrors. And in cosier surroundings one is less apt 
to be shy.” 

“Two women to assist at least?” 

“Two women well on in years; find me a pair in their sixties, 
it’s a caprice. I’ve been many times assured that nothing is quite so 
stimulating as natural decrepitude; this might be the occasion to 
try some of that.” 


” 


358 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


An hour later I was in conference with Clairwil. ‘I have only 
one suggestion to make,”’ said she after ] had sketched the Min- 
ister’s project. “Those young ladies doubtless have lovers, favorites 
at any rate; we must locate’ them, make off with them, and include 
them in the festivities: these situations ordinarily afford any number 
of possibilities.” 

I hasten to the Minister’s residence, report Clairwil’s idea 
to him; it meets with his approval; the date of the party is post- 
poned a week; and a hunt for the lovers is got under way. 

The wicked treachery necessary for their discovery was sheer 
joy for Saint-Fond. He takes himself to the Bastille, has each of 
those girls cast into a cell, interrogates first one, then the other, 
causing them to tremble now with hope, now with fear, and some- 
times with both at once, all most cunningly; he finally learns that 
the younger, Mademoiselle Faustine, is in love with a young man 
by the name of Dormon. of the same age as she; and her sister, 
Mademoiselle Felicity, who is twenty-eight, has given her heart to 
one Delnos, a year or two her senior and renowned throughout 
Paris for his good looks. Four days sufficed to have these young 
men behind bars; the charges leveled against them were somewhat 
vague and altogether false but, because never seriously examined, 
more than sufficient in an age when the abuses of privilege and 
influence were such that even the valets of high-placed personages 
were in the habit of jailing just about whomever they liked. These 
latest victims lay but a right in the Bastille; they were conveyed 
the next to my country domain whence the young ladies had been 
brought the previous day. Clairwil and I received our guests as they 
arrived and locked them away, but in separate chambers; so that, 
though they were all lodged under the same roof, they could not 
suspect that they had their beloved for neighbor. 

After an enormous dinner we removed to a drawing room 
where all stood in readiness for the projected execrations. Garbed 
as Roman matrons and making up switches, the two sexagenarians 
were awaiting orders. Saint-Fond, impressed by Clairwil’s magnif- 
cent ass, wished to render it homage before doing anything else. 
Resting upon a sofa, the hussy presented it to him in the most 
artistic manner; and while I sucked her clitoris, Saint-Fond darted 
six inches or more of tongue into her entrails. 


Juliette %- 359 


By now,he is erected; he embuggers Clairwil, kissing my ass 
meanwhile; the next instant he sodomizes me, as he does so caress- 
ing Clairwil’s voluptuous behind. 

“And now to work,” says the Minister, ‘‘any further delay 
will cost me a discharge: there’s no resisting such asses as yours.” 

“Saint-Fond,” Clairwil says, “I have two boons to ask you. 
You have a notable capacity for cruelty. Pray exercise it to the 
full, my dear, that is my first request. The second is that you enable 
me to exercise mine: entrust to me the murder of these young men. 
Torturing males is still my favorite pastime; you enjoy tormenting 
persons of my sex, I am equally fond of making representatives of 
yours suffer, and from martyrizing these two pretty fellows I expect 
to derive no less satisfaction, and possibly even more, than you will 
reap from massacring their two mistresses.” 

“Clairwil, you are a monster.” 

“I know I am, my dear; and the one thing that mortifies me 
is to have to own myself outdone by you every day.” 

Saint-Fond declaring his desire to see.each of the four lovers 
in turn, one of the old attendants brought in Dormon, he whose 
mistress was Faustine. 

“Young man,” Clairwil began, “you are standing before your 
master, therefore see to it that the most complete submissiveness 
characterizes your behavior and a most scrupulous truthfulness 
your replies; it is in his Lordship’s hands that lies your life.” 

“Alas,” the unhappy one replied, “there is truly nothing that I 
have to say, Madame. As to what I could have done to merit 
arrest I have not the faintest notion, nor can I understand why 
I am become -the victim of fate.” 

Clairwil was devouring him with her eyes. ‘““Were you not to 
wed Faustine ?”’ 

“My whole heart and soul were set on making mine the 
happiness of having her to be my wife.” 

“You know nothing of the dreadful affair her family was 
implicated in?” 

“In truth, Madame, of her family I know nothing but what 
was seemly and decent and virtuous; could vice exist whence 
Faustine came ?”’ 

“Bah,” said I, ‘he prates like a hero out of a novel.” 


360 @ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“T shall always be a loyal friend to virtue.” 

“Youthful enthusiasm therefor,” Clairwil advanced, ‘‘has 
proved the undoing of a good many persons like yourself. But we 
are here concerned with other matters; the object of this interview 
is to inform you that Faustine is in this house. The Minister is 
disposed to enjoy her; he trusts you are disposed to cede her 
favors; in exchange for which concession she will be pardoned and 
so will you.” 

“I seek no pardon since I have done no wrong,” was the young 
man’s proud reply. “But be it so a thousand lives hang: in the 
balance, I do declare to you that I’ll not purchase one of them at 
the price of an atrocity whose mere mention is an insult.” 

“So be it. dss, Madame, give me ass,” cried Saint-Fond in 
a veritable lather, “it’s plain indeed we'll reach no understanding 
with this stubborn little scapegrace unless we use violence.” 

At which Clairwil and the two hags leaped upon the young 
man, and had him piniored and naked in the twinkling of an eye. 
He was marched up to Saint-Fond, who spent a few minutes poring 
Over a man-ass than which there were few fairer in the world; and, 
gentlemen, as connoisseurs you know that in this article of the 
anatomy you may often reveal yourselves our superiors. 

“Ah,” said Dormor, gazing about him in distress as he real- 
ized what infamies lay in store for him, “ah, I’ve been tricked. I 
am amongst monsters.” 

“Your surmise, Sir,” said Clairwil, “is quite correct, and 
experience will soon confirm it.” 

And after some preliminary abominations I was requested to 
bring in Faustine. Beauty, shapeliness, sweet candor, all that invites, 
these she had in rare degree; and when she beheld the scene in the 
room, oh, how the modesty in her made her other qualities shine! 
Espying her lover, whom Clairwil and Saint-Fond were caressing 
industriously, the girl came near to fainting away. 

“Be easy, sweet angel,” I said, taking her hand, “be of good 
cheer, we’re fucking, we’ie swimming in dirt and nastiness and joy, 
my dove; like us, shamelessly, you’re going to bare your wondrous 
ass; and you'll see ’tis not unpleasant.” 

“But—but what is all this? Oh, merciful heavens, where am 
1? Who are you?” 


Juliette & 361 


“Your host is his Lordship, the Minister, your uncle and 
friend: your case is in his hands. It is a difficult case, yea, a very 
grave case; however, be patient, be considerate, and everything 
will come out well.” 

“And you,” she said in a faltering voice, addressing Dormon, 
“you have been capable—” 

“Oh,” he murmured, casting down his eyes, “like you I have 
had to submit to force. But,’ he went on, lifting his head, “while 
this is the day of our dishonor, there may soon come another that 
shall see us revenged.” 

“Enough of this frightful comic-opera rubbish, young man,” 
reprimanded Saint-Fond, applying a vigorous thwack to the glib 
boy’s bare hindquarters, “better employ your fiery eloquence to 
persuade mademoiselle here to lend herself to my caprices, and 
they shan’t be mild. She’s going to be sore tried.” 

Whereat tears began to flow from Faustine’s glorious eyes, 
she uttered groans; cruel Saint-Fond, prick in hand, approached 
and stared at her from close on. 

“By fuck! he exclaimed, “does she weep? It pleases me 
mightily to see women weep, with me they always do, all of them. 
Cry away, my pretty little one, cry your eyes out—here, let your 
tears splash on my member. But save some for later on, you'll 
shortly have the most legitimate grounds for shedding them.” 

Nay, I shrink from telling how far his outrages went, one 
would have thought nothing so contented him as wounding inno- 
cence and insulting beauty in distress. The faint glow of pleasure we 
managed to kindle in the girl turned swiftly into chagrin; ’twas 
with his prick Saint-Fond dried a new spate of tears. 

Clairwil’s main passion, as I have said, did net consist in 
vexing women; it was men upon whom she preferred to expend 
her greatest cruelty, whereof Nature had given her no small fund. 
However, though she might now and then refrain from inflicting 
pain, even upon a person of the opposite sex, she always relished 
watching others in action; and, standing near Dormon, whom as a 
matter of fact she was frigging, with wicked curiosity she observed 
all the outrages poor Faustine was being made to endure; more, 
she suggested further ones. 

‘Well now,”’ said Saint-Fond, ‘“‘we must unite those who were 


362 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


so soon to have been bound together in marital bliss. Far be it from 
me,” he added, “to deny this young gentleman one of his pretty 
mistress’ two maidenheads. Clairwil, dispose the male, I'll prepare 
the female.” 

I confess that I did not believe the enterprise could possibly 
succeed. Terror, grief, alarm, tears—in fine, the two lovers were 
in a shocking state; did it not exclude them from performing the 
act of love? One would have thought so. But now we were witness 
to a very prodigy, one of those miracles only Nature can work: her 
energy triumphed over all obstacles: and we beheld a rampant 
Dormon fucking his mistress. Of the two, only she needed to be 
held; only in her was pain predominant, forbidding her access to 
pleasure; and this despite all our efforts: we tried this, we tried 
that, we excited her, scolded her, caressed her, it availed not, her 
soul lay beyond rescue, drowned in sorrow; from her we got moans 
of despair and sobs only. 

“Still, you know, I like her that way,” said Saint-Fond; “I’ve 
never cared much about seeing pleasure’s lineaments writ over a 
woman’s countenance. They’re too equivocal, too unsure; I prefer 
the signs of pain, which are more dependable by far.” 

By now blood has begun to flow, the deflowering is completed. 
Thus posed by Clairwil, Dormon was lying on his back, Faustine 
was astride him, her knees drawn up, her head bent low, her fore- 
head resting on his shoulder; so that the pretty little girl’s pretty 
ass was perfectly exposed. 

‘She is in an admirable position, see to it she doesn’t move out 
of it,” Saint-Fond told one of the crones; ‘‘she might as well lose 
both pucelages at the same time, I might as well sodomize her while 
she is being encunted.” 

Not only was the operation a stunning success, but, instead of 
sighs of ecstasy, it drew )iercing screams from the girl whom never 
before had such a dart penetrated, and who seemed as though 
firmly set against enjoying the experience, generally longed for, 
that makes a woman of the maid. While fucking, the libertine 
fondled the hags; I busied myself sucking Clairwil’s cunt. The 
prudent Saint-Fond, as ever sparing of his fuck, kept the sluices 
tight closed, and we moved on to other voluptuous activities. 

‘Hear me, young man,” said Saint-Fond. “I am about to 


Juliette + 363 


require something most extraordinary of you, and which I venture 
to suppose you will consider most barbarous. Be that as it may, your 
mistress is doomed unless you obey instructions. I am going to have 
your beloved secured to this column here, you will take this bundle 
of switches, and with them you will flay her ass.” 

‘Monster! Can you propose—”’ 

‘Then you prefer to see her killed?” 

‘‘Why must it be that I have no choice between this infamy 
and the loss of her whom I cherish above all others in the world?” 

“A hard alternative surely, and such as the weak have every 
day to face,” said I. “You are helpless, hence you must yield: do 
as you are bid, do it at once, or a dagger goes into your mistress’ 
heart.” 

The great art of Saint-Fond consisted in always placing his 
victims in such a situation that of two evils they had inevitably to 
elect the one which more nicely suited his perfidious libertinage. 
Trembling, Dormon neither agrees nor refuses; his silence speaks. 
Tis I who bind Faustine to the column, great is my pleasure in 
pulling the rough cords painfully over her fair skin; I love thus to 
bare the throat of innocence to the edge of crime’s blade; the 
malicious Clairwil kisses her as I get her into readiness. What 
charms were here to expose, what perfections to spoil! Ah, when 
heaven comes not to the defense of the righteous and the good, 
it is in order to make us mortals comprehend that unto virtue only 
contempt is due. 

“This is the proper way to take with you,” said the Minister, 
striking sweeping blows upon the plump white buttocks that fairly 
beckoned to him. ‘“‘Yes, it is thus we must proceed,” he continued, 
rattling off another ten; and the purple marks they left were 
already standing out in marvelous contrast to that silky smooth 
skin. “Try your hand.” 

“Oh, Sir, for the love of God, I could never... .” 

“Nonsense, my boy, of course you can.” Threats follow sar- 
donic cajolery; Clairwil loses her temper, swears that if he doesn’t 
do as he’s been told, which, says she, amounts to very little, he will 
get a thrashing himself and see the girl murdered into the bargain; 
whereupon Dormon sets to work. But how reluctantly! And how 
timidly. Saint-Fond is obliged to guide his arm. At length my 


364 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lover’s patience runs out, he picks up a knife and raises it to 
Faustine’s heaving breast; Dormon lays on somewhat more ener- 
getically . . . then collapses in a swoon. 

“Ah, fuck my soul,” grumbles Saint-Fond, his prick as stiff 
as a monk’s, “we'll get nowhere so long as we rely upon a lover: 
this undertaking calls for villainy.”’ 

And having furiously at the beauteous behind presented to 
him, in less than ten min ates he has it in a bloody shambles. In the 
meantime another horrors being enacted near by: instead of 
succoring him, Clairwil is venting her savagery upon the uncon- 
scious Dormon. 

“The lout, the cad,’ says she, as he comes back to his senses 
to find himself bound hand and foot and receiving a drubbing 
quite as merciless as the one Faustine is getting from the Minister. 

It was not long before the ill-starred lovers were both in the 
most deplorable state imaginable. Not yet in a position to judge 
Clairwil, her cruelty, I must confess, startled me; but when I saw 
her turn to execrations 2f a very different kind, when I saw her 
daubing her cheeks with the victim’s blood, tasting it, drinking it, 
when I saw her bite into his flesh and tear it away with her teeth; 
when I saw her rub her clitoris on the bleeding wounds she opened 
in the wretch, when I heard her cry, ‘Juliette, come do as I am 
doing”; then, urged to it by this wild beast, carried away by her 
hideous example—ah, m:, friends, must I own that I imitated her? 
Nay, the truth may well be that I surpassed her; I may even have 
led the way, stimulated her imagination by means of atrocities 
which would not have occurred to her otherwise; perhaps, who 
knows? For I waxed furious too, my every nerve was afire, my 
very perverse soul revealed itself in its entirety; and I discovered 
that devouring the flesh 2f a man could have as powerful an effect 
upon my senses as lashing a woman to ribbons. 

Saint-Fond deemed best to defer major operations until after 
the other couple had been dealt with. The first two were tied up 
and stowed in a corner; in came the second. Delnos and Felicity 
were subjected to the same treatment, except that the procedure 
was reversed: that is, instead of appealing to the lover to share 
his mistress, we appealed to the mistress for the use of her lover; 
arguments were again backed by threats of the worst sort and as 


Juliette 3 365 


before we met with considerable resistance. Felicity was an exceed- 
ingly pretty thing of twenty, not quite so fair as her sister but just 
as agreeably made, and her eyes were remarkably expressive; she 
gave evidence of more character, more energy than her sister, but 
Delnos of far less than Dormon. Howbeit, directly after embug- 
gering this second girl, our cannibal, despite himself, lost his seed in 
Delnos’ handsome ass while he was clawing Felicity’s charming 
breasts. Now quietly seated between Clairwil, busily socratizing 
him, and me who was frigging him, and gazing ahead at the two 
couples, bound hand and foot, he consulted us over what the final 
fate of the victims ought to be. 

“I was appointed tobe the scourge of this family,” he said to 
us, fingering himself while he spoke; ‘three of its members lost 
their heads in this house, two others I had slain in theirs, I am 
responsible for another’s poisoning in the Bastille, and the chances 
that these four people will escape me look very slim indeed. You 
have no idea how I enjoy these little exercises in arithmetic. 
Tiberius, it is said, used.to do his sums every evening; what would 
crime be without its sweet memories? Oh, Clairwil, whither are our 
passions leading us? Say, my angel, is thy mind clear enough, hast 
thou perchance discharged enough to give me thy sagely framed 
opinion in this matter ?” 

“No, by fuck,” replied she, “‘no, it’s not talking I’m eager to 
do, what I want is to act. Vitriol, blazing acid, some hellish thing is 
flowing in my veins, my brain is sick—oh, give me horrors! I must 
have horrors—” 

“Then let us commit.them in abundance, for that sorts nicely 
with my mood also,”’ said Saint-Fond; “these two couples arouse 
me: it passeth all belief, the evil | would do unto them. But as to 
the form it should take, there I am in some uncertainty.” 

The doomed four were able to hear our conversation; were 
able to see we were plotting against them... and yet they clung 
to life. 

The awful wheel of Delcour’s contriving stood within view. 
Saint-Fond’s brooding gaze lit upon it, and the thought of putting 
it to a little use soon lofted his prick skyward. Thereupon, after 
loudly and unequivocally explaining the properties of the infernal 
machine, the scoundrel declared that the two women should draw 


366 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lots, would that not be the fairest way to determine which of the 
two was to die in this manner ? Clairwil opposed the suggestion; she 
took the line that, since Saint-Fond had already employed the 
wheel upon a girl, he ought now to procure himself the pleasure of 
seeing a boy subjected tc it; nor did she notice any advantage in 
allowing chance to decide between Delnos and Dormon, for as much 
as the latter struck her as by far the more eligible, he stimulated 
her imagination prodigizusly. But Saint-Fond would brook no 
partiality; he pointed out that the honor of being the first to die, 
and by such a torture, was preference enough. Lots are prepared; 
the young men draw; Dormon is the winner. 

“It’s quite as thougt. I had heaven by the throat, for it’s been 
a long time now since a single one of my wishes went unfulfilled,” 
said Clairwil. “The sole function of that execrable chimera you 
call the Supreme Being seems to be to facilitate my every crime.” 

‘Embrace your intended,” said my lover as he untied some of 
Dormon’s bonds, leaving intact those which secured his hands; 
‘‘kiss her, my lad, and then show your mettle: she’ll have her eyes 
upon you throughout your ordeal. And if you care to glance at me 
during it, you'll see me fucking her ass, that I promise you.” 

Then, as was his custom, he led the powerless young man off, 
they were encloseted for an hour together; we could only suppose 
that the libertine took this opportunity to impart some deep 
secret to his victim, to whom, as it were, he entrusted the mission 
of carrying it with him into the next world. 

‘“‘What can be going on in there?” Clairwil demanded, an- 
noyed at having to wait and glancing impatiently at the door to the 
chamber. 

“I have no idea,” said I, “‘but such is my eagerness to find 
out, I would be almost willing to sacrifice our relationship. . . .” 

_ Dormon emerged: his flesh showed signs of some cruel maul- 
ing, especially about his buttocks and thighs, which were cut and 
bruised; upon his uplifted brow rage and fear and pain were at 
war; blood dripped from his penis and his scrotum, and his cheeks, 
scarlet, revealed traces of several slaps. After him came Saint- 
Fond, conspicuously erected; the most atrocious savagery glinted 
in his every feature, in his twisted lips, his dilating nostrils, his 


Juliette 367 


wickedly narrowed eyes; clutching one of his victim’s buttocks, he 
steered him toward us. 

“Come along, come along,” said Clairwil, visibly pleased at 
seeing Dormon in such beggarly condition, “come along, my little 
clown, let’s waste no more time.’’ Turning to Saint-Fond, ‘‘We are 
short on men,” the diabolical creature observed; “I am going to 
need no end of fucking while I watch this rogue perish.” 

‘His mistress could pollute you,” the Minister suggested, 
‘and I shall of course be embuggering you the whole time. . . .” 

“And his blood ?” 

“Oh, we're sure to be splashed a bit.”’ 

Clairwil- seized Dormon by both ears. “Kiss me, little fool, 
while there’s still something left of your pretty face.” 

And Dormon showing no great alacrity to comply, the hussy 
wiped her asshole upon his nose; then he was granted permission 
to kiss his mistress goodbye. She burst into tears. Clairwil frigged 
the wight, the lass’ clitoris was tickled by Saint-Fond; the matrons 
finally catch hold of him and fasten him on the dread wheel. 
Faustine, sprawled atop Clairwil, is obliged to frig her; and at 
the same time Clairwil excites me. Saint-Fond sheathes his weapon 
in Faustine’s bowels, and we are all four shortly bathing in blood. 
The spectacle is hideous, and it has not yet reached its term when 
the girl proves unable to endure any more; smitten senseless by 
anguish, she wilts. 

“What's this, what’s this!’’ cries Saint-Fond, ‘would the 
bitch expire? I have no objection to her death provided I am its 
cause.” 

So saying, the villain looses his sperm into a mass whence life 
has fled already. Clairwil, whose wicked hands are kneading 
Delnos’ balls while I am stabbing that young man’s buttocks with a 
long hatpin, is at last overwhelmed by the sight of Dormon on the 
wheel, and, uttering maniac, hardly human screams, discharges 
thrice. 

Now only Felicity and her young beau are left. 

‘Ah, by fuck,” mutters Saint-Fond, “that other bitch was a 
great disappointment, but this one is going to be tortured properly; 
and since it was the mistress watching the lover die a moment ago, 
we'll have the lover watch the mistress now.”’ 


368 2° THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


He leads her away for private conference, half an hour 
later he brings her back; and she is in a shocking state. She is 
condemned to impalement; Saint-Fond himself inserts the sharp- 
ened end of the stake into her ass and after much thrusting and 
twisting the point emerges from the mouth; the other end of the 
stake is planted in a socket set in the floor, and Felicity remains on 
exhibit for the rest of the day. 

“My friends,” says. Clairwil, “you will be good enough to 
allow me to choose the torture for our last victim. I haven’t 
changed my mind since first clapping eyes on him: the bugger 
resembles Jesus Christ, and I would treat him in the same way.” 

At this we all laughed merrily; arrangements were completed 
during the interview, no detail was neglected. One of the hags gets 
down on all fours, we prop the text on her rump, the story of the 
passion of Mary’s bastard is located; I read out the chapter and 
verse aloud. The young man is already in bedraggled condition 
when he returns; Clairwil, Saint-Fond, and the unoccupied hag 
take charge of him; he is afhxed to the cross, and upon it he 
suffers precisely what that impudent little bore out of Galilee 
endured at the hands of those wise Romans of old: his side is 
gashed, he is crowned with thorns, he is given a vinegar-soaked 
sponge to suck. At length, remarking that Delnos is in no hurry 
to die, we institute improvements upon the classical ordeal: the 
patient is lifted off the cross, turned over, nailed on again, and 
every kind of horror is serpetrated upon his behind; we prick his 
buttocks, we sear them, nd tear them into shreds; by the time he 
finally expires, Delnos ‘as gone mad. Clairwil and Saint-Fond, 
whom I have been frigging one on either hand, discharge copiously ; 
and therewith ended infamies at which we had been twelve hours 
occupied. They were succeeded by the pleasures of the table. 

Clairwil was deeply curious to learn Saint-Fond’s secret; she 
plied him with wine, she caressed and praised him till he was 
quite giddy; then she put the question: “What is it you do with 
your victims just prior to killing them?” 

“T announce their death to them.” 

“That's not all you do. There’s more, we’re convinced of it.” 

“No, that’s all.” 

‘““There’s more. We know there is.” 


Juliette be 369 


“Perhaps. But it’s merely one of my failings. Why force me 
to reveal it?” 

“Ought you to keep secrets from us?” I asked my lover. 

“In truth, it’s no secret,” said he. 

“You hide it from us, however. Pray tell us what it is.” 

‘What purpose would that serve?” 

“It would satisfy our curiosity, and we are the two best 
friends you have in the world.” 

“You are cruel women,” said he, and he sighed. ‘‘Don’t you 
realize that I cannot make this confession without acknowledging 
a dreadful weakness in me, a veritably unavowable paltriness ?” 

“You can afford to divulge it to us.” 

We redoubled our pleas and flatteries, our caresses and 
seductions conquered, the Minister waved us to our chairs and 
addressed us in this wise: 

“Fierce and long has been my struggle against the shameful 
yoke of religion, my friends; and I must confess to you today that 
I am yet its captive insofar as I still have hopes of a life after this. 
If it is true, I say to myself, that there are punishments and 
rewards in the next world, the victims of my wickedness will 
triumph, they will know bliss. This idea hurls me into deepest 
despond, owing to my extreme barbarity this idea is a very torture 
to me. Whenever I immolate an object, whether to my ambition or 
to my lubricity, my desire is to make its sufferings last beyond the 
unending immensity of ages; such has been my desire, and had been 
for a long time when I broached it to a famous libertine whom I 
was greatly attached to in days bygone, and whose tastes were the 
same as mine. He was a man of vast knowledge, his attainments in 
alchemy and astrology were especially noteworthy; he assured me 
that I was very correct indeed in my suspicion that there are punish- 
ments and rewards to come; and that, in order to bar the victim 
from celestial joys, it is necessary to have him sign a pact, writ in 
his heart’s blood, whereby he contracts his soul to the devil; next 
to insert this paper in his asshole and to tamp it home with one’s 
prick; and while doing so to cause him to suffer the greatest pain 
in one’s power to inflict. Observe these measures, my friend 
assured me, and no individual you destroy will enter into heaven. 
His agonies, in kind identical to those you make him endure while 


370 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


burying the pact, shall be everlasting; and yours will be the un- 
speakable delight of prolonging them beyond the limits of eternity, 
if eternity there be.” 

‘And so that is what you do to your victims?” 

“Softly, Clairwil, berate me not. You wanted nothing so much 
as to learn the truth. It is a weakness you wheedled me into dis- 
closing. I am not proud of it.” 

“No, nor should you be. Why, Saint-Fond, I am amazed! I 
thought you were a phi osopher. You have a mind, do you not? 
Then how can you for a single instant accept the absurd claptrap 
about the immortality of the soul? For, is it not so, this disgusting 
religious fantasy must first be accepted before you begin to believe 
in the rewards and punishments of an afterlife? 

‘As for your intention, I applaud it, it is delicious,” Clairwil 
continued, “‘it accords with my own attitudes: to want to prolong 
for ever the sufferings of the person you send to his doom—tHat is 
a desire which does you credit. But to base it all upon nonsense, 
upon extravagances—no. Saint-Fond, that will not do, that is quite 
unpardonable.” 

“Clairwil, do you not understand that my divine hope must 
fade away unless founded upon such an opinion as I entertain?” 

“I do very well understand, my good man, that if you have.to 
edify your divine hopes upon fables, it would be better to give them 
up; for the day may come when the harm belief in fables has done 
you will prove to outwe gh the pleasures you have received there- 
from. Come, come, Sairit-Fond: be content with the evil you can 
work in this world and abandon your foolish schemes for perpetu- 
ating it for ever.” 

‘‘Saint-Fond, there is no afterlife,” said I at this point, recol- 
lecting the philosophical tenets which had been very early inculcated 
in me; “‘the sole authority vouching for that illusion is the imagina- 
tion of those men who, dreaming it up and clinging to it, merely 
expressed their desire to find later on a more durable and purer 
happiness than what is our portion on earth. Ah, is it not a pitiful 
absurdity, first of all to invent for oneself a God, then to believe 
that this God holds torments without end in store for the majority 
of humankind! Thus it is, after rendering mortals miserable in this 
world, religion shows them a weird deity, the fruit of their 


Juliette & 371 


credulousness or their knavish cunning, a deity, I say, who’s very 
apt to render them more miserable still in the world to come. I 
know how they quibble: this God’s justice is horrible, but this God 
is merciful also; but a mercifulness which leaves room for appalling 
cruelty is far from infinite; neither is it reliable; after having been 
infinitely good, he becomes infinitely wicked; and is this what you 
call an immutable God? A God overflowing vindictiveness and 
fury, is this the sort of entity.to whom you ascribe one jot of 
clemency or kindliness? To judge from the notions expounded by 
theologians, one must conclude that God created most men simply 
with a view to crowding hell. Would it not have been more con- 
forming to honesty, to goodness, to common sense and decency, to 
have created stones and plants and gone no farther, instead of 
creating men whose behavior would bring unending calamity down 
on their heads? A God so perfidious, so evil as to create a single 
man and then to leave him exposed to the peril of damning himself, 
such a God can be regarded as no specimen of excellence; if per- 
fection be his, then it is a monster of unreason, injustice, malice, 
and foul atrocity. Nay, very far from composing a perfect God, 
theology’s adepts formed the most loathsome chimera; and when 
to this abominable God they ascribed the invention of eternal 
penalties, they but added the final touch to an artifact that was 
hateful from the start. The cruelty that makes for our pleasure 
has at least its purposes and hence its justification; this latter is 
accessible to the reason, we understand it; but what motive has God 
for torturing the victims of his wrath? Has he rivals? Is he threat- 
ened? No, those he packs off to hellfire were able neither to contest 
his power nor trouble his felicity. Let me add that the tortures of 
the life after this would be of no use to the living who cannot 
witness them; they would be of no use to the damned, since there 
are no new leaves turned over in hell; whence it follows that in 
the exercise of his eternal vengeance, God’s sole aim is to enjoy 
himself, and having exploited his creatures’ frailties, to make the 
most of their helplessness; and your infamous God, acting more 
cruelly than any mortal, and without any motive a man might have, 
in so doing shows himself infinitely a traitor, infinitely a cheat, and 
infinitely a villain.” 

“I think we may go farther,” said Clairwil. “If that is agree- 


372 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


able to you, I shall attempt a more detailed analysis of this per- 
nicious and gloomy hell dogma; I am confident that by the time 
I am done, our friend shall have abandoned every bit of his faith 
in this pathetic, onerous superstition. Will you lend me your ears?” 

“Certainly,” said we. 

And then it was as follows that the subtle and erudite Clairwil 
addressed herself to this solemn question. 

“There are certain dogmas which one is sometimes obliged 
not to accept but to posit hypothetically for the purpose of com- 
bating others. My aim you know, and you will allow that it is 
worthy: to obliterate the idiotic dogma of hell out of your 
apprehension; I trust you will not take it amiss if, with this 
end in view, and for the time being, I reinstate the deistic chimera. 
Bound to employ it as point of departure in this important disserta- 
tion, I am forced temporarily to ascribe substance to the myth; this 
is regrettable-but I am sure you will excuse it, and excuse it all the 
more readily knowing, as you do, that as regards belief in this 
abominable phantom, I am above suspicion. 

“In itself, the dogma of hell is, I own, so devoid of prob- 
ability, all the arguments customarily advanced in its support 
are so weak, so transparent, in such manifest contradiction with 
reason, that one almost blushes at having to counter them. Never 
mind; let us ruthlessly deprive the Christians even of the hope of 
fettering us anew at the feet of their atrocious confession, and let 
us very plainly show them that the dogma they count upon most 
heavily to affright us vanishes, like all their other ghosts and gob- 
lins, at the mere approach of philosophy’s rational light. 

“The primary arguments in the case they make out for their 
baneful fairy tale are these: 

“1) That sin being infinite by virtue of the fact sin is offensive 
to God, the sinner merits infinite punishment; that the Almighty 
having decreed the laws, it behooves his mightiness to punish those 
who transgress them. 

2) The universality of this doctrine, and the manner in which 
we find it enunciated in Scriptures. 

“3) The high need for such a dogma, lacking which there 
would be no restraining sinners and the incredulous. 


Juliette & 373 


“The whole edifice sits on those foundations; now let us de- 
molish them. 

“Taking them in the above order, we begin with the first: it, 
I have no doubt but that you will concur, is exploded by the glaring 
disproportion between the human provocation and the divine re- 
prisal. We observe that according to this doctrine the pettiest fault 
is to be punished as severely as the gravest; now, presuming our 
God just, for so he is accounted, how can we admit such iniquity ? 
Who created man, anyhow? Who gave him the passions and the 
penchants which the torments of hell are to punish him for having? 
Who else but your God? And thus, half-witted Christians, you are 
disposed to imagine this preposterous God endowing man with 
impulses one minute and being compelled the next to chasten man 
for having acted upon them? But was it that God did not know 
what he was doing? Is it a blind incompetent fool you worship? 
Did he not know that man, endowed by him with the power to mis- 
behave, would outrage him inevitably? If God knew, then why did 
he not otherwise endow man? And if he did not know, then why 
does he punish defective man when he, the Maker, is alone to 
blame? 

“T think it is only too obvious that under the conditions alleged 
to be necessary to salvation, we are far more likely to be damned 
than saved. So tell me then, is this your God’s so loudly vaunted 
justice, to have placed his puny, miserable masterpiece in such an 
abominable position? and this being the system, how dare your 
doctors assert that eternal happiness and eternal unhappiness are 
presented to man to choose between, and that his destiny depends 
on his option alone? If it comes out that the fate of the greater 
share of mankind is to be eternally unhappy, an all-knowing God 
must have known this from the outset; why then did the monster 
create us? Was he forced to? Then he is not free. Did he knowingly, 
deliberately, cause things so to be? Then he is a fiend. No, God was 
under no obligation to create man, certainly not, and if he did so 
simply to expose man to such a fate, the propagation of our 
species therewith becomes the foulest of all crimes, and nothing 
would be more desirable than the total extinction of humankind. 

“If however you esteem this dogma necessary to the greatness 
of God, I must ask you why this God, so great and so good, failed 


374 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to give man the capacities he would need in order to avoid the 
torture awaiting perhaps nine out of ten human beings. Is it not, 
to say the least, cruel on God’s part to allow man opportunities and 
an appetite for dooming aimself eternally ? And however are you to 
exonerate your God from. a charge either of ignorance or of wicked- 
ness, the one as criminal as the other ? 

“If all men are equal in the eyes of the Divinity who made 
them, why are they not all in agreement as to the particular crimes 
which are to cost man this everlasting suffering? Why does the 
Hottentot damn you for something which if you are a Chinaman 
sees you into paradise, and how is it, pray tell, that the latter will 
promise you a place in heaven for what lands the Christian in hell ? 
Endless would be the task of listing the various opinions of pagans, 
Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, concerning the means to employ 
to escape eternal woe and to attain felicity; endless the task, and 
yet more cheerless, of describing the puerile and ridiculous formulas 
and devices invented to these ends. 

“But we shall proceed to examine the second of the founda- 
tions they have endeavored to construct for this grotesque doctrine: 
its peculiar enunciation as shown in the Writ, and its universal 
character. 

“We ought to preface our remarks with a reminder to our- 
selves: let us beware of taking the universality of any belief for a 
title in its favor. There is not one idiocy, not one form of madness, 
that has not enjoyed a general currency and mode; not one that has 
wanted for adherents any more than for exponents; so long as 
there are men on earth there will be fools, and so long as there 
are fools there will be gods, cults, a heaven, a hell, etc. But Scrip- 
ture contains it all in black and white, you tell me. We shall for a 
moment suppose that the texts so called have some authenticity, 
and that they truly merit some respect. (I think I have already 
pointed out that to attain a position from which one can blast cer- 
tain absurdities one may have to play lip service to certain others.) 

‘Very well. My reply, to begin with, is that there are strong 
grounds for doubting whether Scripture mentions this doctrine at 
all. Supposing nevertheless that it does, what Scripture says can be 
addressed to none but those who are familiar with these writings 
and acknowledge them as infallible; those who have no acquaintance 


Juliette 2% 375 


of them, or who refuse to believe them, cannot be convinced by their 
authority; however, is it not maintained that they who have no 
acquaintance of this Scripture, or they who do not believe it, are 
subject to eternal punishment, just as are those others who are 
acquainted with Scripture or who believe it? What say you, is not 
this dreadful injustice ? 

“Perhaps you'll say that some races or nations to whom your 
nonsensical sacred literature was completely unknown had no lack 
of belief in a future life made up of eternal suffering. This may be 
true of some peoples; many others, however, had ‘no knowledge 
of these dogmas. But precisely how were such opinions able to make 
their way into the heads of a people unacquainted with the Bible? 
I trust nobody will tell me that we are here dealing with innate 
ideas; for in that case we would find these opinions in all men every- 
where. Nor do I fancy anybody will maintain that they naturally 
stem from the human reason; for surely his reason is not apt to 
advise man that he will suffer infinite punishment for finite wrongs; 
nor is revelation the answer, since the people in our example know 
nothing of that. To what then must we ascribe the existence of this 
dogma among this particular people? Either to the people’s fancy 
or to the plotting of its priests; these being the sources of the 
superstition, how can you allow it any substance? 

“Were you to conjecture that, there where we find no Scrip- 
ture, belief in eternal punishment has been handed down by tradi- 
tion, I should have to ask where they got it from, who spread 
the word originally; and if you are unable to prove that they re- 
ceived it through divine revelation, you shall have to agree with me 
that this tremendous opinion must have arisen out of some disease 
of the imagination or some piece of roguery. 

‘Supposing now that Scripture, allegedly holy, informs men of 
punishments in a future life, and supposing that this announcement 
is in no sense a false alarm, might one not wonder how the authors 
of Scripture could know that such punishments did in actual fact 
exist? The unfailing reply is, of course, that they were inspired; 
splendid. But those who have not been favored by this special 
illumination have therefore had to take the word of others for it; 
pray tell me, if you please, what confidence should one have in 
persons who concerning a fact of such importance declare to you, 


376 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘I believe it is true because so-and-so told me he dreamt it.’ And 
lo! there it stands before you: that’s what haunts and preoccupies, 
and what frightens and debilitates half the human race; that’s what 
prevents one man out of two from hearkening to Nature’s sweetest 
promptings! Is it possible to be more mistaken, to tumble more 
needlessly into error? But your inspired ones did not get in touch 
with everybody; the vast majority of mankind knows nothing about 
their reveries. It is, is it not, to the vital interest not only of the 
men who wrote the Bible and their adherents but of all men to be 
apprised of this dogma? Then why is it that some, nay, many, 
whole multitudes, have been left in the dark ? This matter of eternal 
punishments being the concern of all, thorough and definitive in- 
formation thereupon would have been of advantage to all; why 
then did God not impart this sublime knowledge directly and im- 
mediately to everyone, without the help and participation of indi- 
viduals who may be suspected of fraud or insanity? To have posi-- 
tively done the very contrary, is this, I ask you, the behavior of a 
being whom you would have me believe infinitely wise and good? 
Does not such conduct rather show all the attributes of stupidity 
and wickedness? Whenever laws are made in a State, does not 
every government bring them to the attention of the public and 
employ every possible means to make generally known what penal. 
ties will be incurred by violation of them? Provided you are ra- 
tional, how can you punish a man for breaking a law he has never 
even heard of ? And whit now, in the face of all these truths, must 
our conclusion be? This: that the institution of a hell has never 
been anything but the result of the malicious lucubrations of some 
men, and the unqualifiable folly of a great many others.” 

‘The third of these: arguments proposed in favor of this fright- 
ful dogma is its indispensability: without it, there would be no hold- 
ing sinners and unbelievers in check. 


12 “Hell,” in the words of one clever writer, “is the stove upon which the 
sacerdotal pot is kept boiling; that kitchen was built for the feeding of priests; it’s 
in order that they fare handsoraely the Eternal Father, their chief cook, spits and roasts 
those of his children who have failed to pay all due attention to their lessons; the 
feasting table is set, the elect are forgathered, they'll be served grilled unbelievers, 
fricasseed millionaires, financiers in gravy,” etc. etc. See The Portable Theology, 
p. 106. 


Juliette 377 


“If you would have me grant you that because of his justice 
and glory God were required to punish sinners and unbelievers 
with eternal tortures, I ask you to grant me in return that reason 
and justice would also require that it be within the power of others 
not to be unbelievers; now what person can possibly be absurd 
enough to suppose that man is free ? Who can be blind to the point 
of not seeing that our will, having nothing to do with any of our 
actions, all our actions being determined for us, we are responsible 
for none of them; and that God who manipulates us puppets would 
be (if we suppose that he exists, which, as you doubtless notice, I do 
with loathing), this God, I say, would be beyond words unjust 
and barbaric if he punished us for helplessly and despite ourselves 
becoming caught in the snares he first lays and then takes pleasure 
driving us into. 

‘And so is it not clear that it is the temperament Nature gives 
to humans, the various circumstances in the life of each individual, 
his education, the society he lives amidst, which determine his be- 
havior and steer him in the direction of good or evil? But (you may 
perhaps object) if this be the case, the punishments which men are 
made to undergo in this world for their misdeeds are likewise un- 
just. They most certainly are. But here the general welfare pre- 
vails, individual welfare must cede thereto; it is the duty of every 
society to eliminate from its midst such elements whose conduct 
may be prejudicial to the community; and this justifies a quantity 
of laws which, when viewed alone from the standpoint of the indi- 
vidual’s self-interest, might appear monstrously unjust. But does, 
your God have any comparable reasons for punishing the evildoer ? 
Obviously not; God Almighty suffers not one whit from the evil- 
doer’s rampages, and if the wicked man is wicked at all, it is be- 
cause omnipotent God was pleased to create him thus. Hence it is 
atrocious to inflict tortures upon him for having become on earth 
the evildoer this execrable God knew full well he would become 
and indeed intended him to become. 

“Let us now demonstrate that the circumstances which decide 
which religious belief a man will have are utterly outside his control. 

“T ask, to begin with, whether we are allowed to exercise any 
choice as to the clime we are born in; and whether, once born into 
this or that church, it is our fault if we happen to lack the capacity 


378 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


for faith. Is there a single religion which can withstand the fire of 
the passions? And are not passions, which come to us from God, 
preferable to religions which come to us from man? What then 
is one to think of this barbaric God who would punish us eternally 
for our metaphysical doubtings—we who cannot believe, owing to 
the belief-destroying passions God put in us? It is a sordid joke. 
From start to finish it is all unutterable nonsense. And how one 
resents wasting one’s time refuting such transparent absurdities! 
However, since we have taken it upon ourselves, let us make a 
thorough job of it and, f possible, leave the lunatic partisans of 
this most ridiculous dogma not one leg to stand on. 

“Therefore we continue. 

“Even were it left to every man to decide for himself whether 
he will or will not be virzuous and believe in all the articles of his 
specific religion; even were this so, we would still have to inquire 
if it were equitable that men be punished eternally, whether because 
of this weakness or their incredulity, when it is only too apparent 
that no good can result from their gratuitous sufferings. 

“To settle this ques:ion we must put our prejudices aside and 
reflect above all upon the justness we acknowledge in God. Is it not 
the height of illogicality :o contend that this God’s justice demands 
the eternal punishing of sinners and unbelievers? Does not the act 
of imposing a punishment out of all proportion to the fault speak 
far more in behalf of vindictiveness and cruelty than of justice? 
To maintain that God punishes in such a manner is obviously noth- 
ing short of blasphemy. What! this God you ‘depict as so good, will 
you have him express his goodness in bullying and brutalizing his 
defenseless children? Most assuredly, they who declare that God’s 
glory requires that he behave like a savage are not fully aware of 
the enormity of this doctrine. They talk about the glory of God 
very idly, they know not whereof they speak. Were they able to 
judge a little of its nature, were they able to arrive at some rational 
conception of it, they would sense that if this being does indeed exist, 
he would have to found his glory not upon his capacities for viol- 
ence, but upon his generosity and kindness, upon his wisdom and 
his boundless power to communicate happiness to mankind. 

‘It is added in passing, with a view to confirming the odious 
doctrine of punishments everlasting, that it has been espoused by a 


Juliette 379 


great many intelligent men and learned theologians. I deny the fact; 
most intelligent men and learned theologians have doubted this 
dogma. And if the rest have appeared to credit it, we can readily 
guess why: the priests, who already held the people in bondage, 
were delighted to clap this iron collar of a hell dogma around their 
necks; we are familiar with the sway terror can exert over simple 
souls, and everyone knows that the politician who wishes to sub- 
jugate others cannot do so without employing it. 

“But those purportedly holy books you cite to me, do they 
come from a source so pure that it is beyond our power to reject 
what they offer us? The speediest perusal of these texts suffices 
to convince us that far indeed from being, as we are brazenly told, 
the work of an illusory God who never wrote a word nor uttered 
one either, they are to the contrary merely the scribblings of weak- 
minded and ignorant men; and they deserve our mistrust, nay, our 
scorn. But even were we to suppose, in defiance of all the evidence, 
that these writers were not completely devoid of common sense; 
bah, what sort of a fool would he be, pray tell me, who was able to 
wax ecstatic over this or that opinion simply because he’d come 
upon it in some book or other? One may adopt an opinion, that is 
permissible ; but to sacrifice one’s life’s happiness and peace of mind 
to it—this, I repeat, only a madman is capable of doing.’* Further- 
more, do you tell me that the Bible’s contents bear out the hell 
opinion, and I in my turn will quote you passages from the same 
book disproving it. I open Ecclesiastes; here is what I see: 


‘I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that 
God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves 
are beasts. , 

‘For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one 
thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have 
all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast: for 
all is vanity. 

‘All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust 
again.’14 


1% Eusebius tells us (in his History, lib. iii: cap. 25) that the Epistle of James, that 
of Jude, the Second of St. Peter, the Second and Third of St. John, the Acts of St. Paul, 
the Revelation of St. Peter, the Epistle of Bzrnabas, the Apostolic Institutions, and the 
Book of the Apocalypse were none of them recognized in his day.

“What could be less favorable to the theory of an afterlife 
than these lines? What could be of greater encouragement to the 
view that denies the immortality of the soul and contests the whole 
ridiculous dogma of a hell ? 

“And so what are the thoughts of the sane individual as he 
peers critically at this absurd fable of man’s eternal damnation 
for having eaten of forbidden fruit in paradise ? However inconse- 
quential this little tale, however repulsive one finds it, permit me 
to dwell upon it for a moment, since it is the point of departure for 
an argument that conducts one to a hell of eternal sufferings. Is not 
an impartial examination of this absurdity quite enough to con- 
vince one of its inexistence? Oh, my friends, answer: would some- 
one full of loving kindness plant in his garden a tree which produces 
delicious but poisonous fruit, and would he be content to warn.-his 
children not to touch it, telling them they will die if they eat thereof ? 
Were he aware of such a tree growing in his garden, would not 
this thoughtful and wise father proceed without delay to chop 
it down, and all the more surely take this precaution in the knowl- 
edge that from eating its dread fruit his children must perish and 
precipitate all ensuing generations into irreparable misery ? But the 
tale reads otherwise: God knows that man shall doom himself and 
his posterity if he bites into the apple: not only does God endow 
man with the capacity to yield to temptation, his wickedness does not 
stop short of arranging man’s seduction. Man succumbs, he is lost; 
he does what God has er abled him to do, what God has invited and 
pushed him into doing, and behold him now, fallen, cursed forever. 
I call this cruelty and viciousness without parallel. No, I repeat, I 
would have spared you the recital of this dismal anecdote, I would 
have disdained to inclucie it in my disquisition were it not for the 
fact that the hell dogmi, whereof I wish to leave not one vestige 
intact, is one of its more sinister consequences. 

‘“‘We may consider all this as so much allegory, fit to provide 
us a moment or two of diversion but not fit for our belief, and 
of which mention ought to be forbidden save as one speaks of 
Aesop’s fables and Mil:on’s gross fantasies; for the latter are of 
slight importance, whereas Biblical incantation, seeking to engross 
our faith, to spoil our pleasures, becomes something of the most 


Juliette & 381 


evident danger and ought to be suppressed ruthlessly until we need 
bother with it no more. 

“So let us be well persuaded that such facts as those which 
are entered in the tedious romance known under the title of the 
Holy Writ are mere abominable falsehoods, worthy of utter con- 
tempt only and without the faintest consequence as regards our 
weal or woe. Let us be further persuaded that the dogma of the im- 
mortality of the soul that had first to be propounded before this 
soul could be rewarded with eternal bliss or damned to eternal 
torments is the most blatant, the most arrant, the crudest and the 
clumsiest of all possible lies; let us realize that when we die, all of 
us dies, as it is with other animals, and that whatever the conduct 
we have observed in the world, we shan’t be any the more or less 
happy for it after we have sojourned there for the longer or shorter 
period Nature is pleased to allot us. 

“It has been asserted that belief in eternal punishments is 
absolutely necessary if human beings are to be kept in check, and 
that we must therefore take utmost care to preserve and promote 
it. But if it becomes evident that this doctrine is false, if it fails 
completely to withstand scrutiny, will you not agree that there 
is infinitely more danger than usefulness in employing it as the 
buttress for your ethics? and may we not wager that it will prove 
of more harm than good once it has been set before the individual 
and he, correctly appraising it, dismisses it for the fiction it is and 
flings himself carefree into evil-doing? is it not a thousand times 
better not to impose any restraints upon him at all than that there 
be a one which he can ignore and flout so easily? In the former case, 
the idea for doing evil may perhaps not occur to him; but it certainly 
will when it occurs to him to break the restraint, for in the break- 
ing thereof a further pleasure exists; and such is the perversity 
in man that he never so cherishes an evil, never so eagerly, so gladly 
performs it, as when he fancies himself somehow hindered from 
doing it. 

“They who have pondered upon the nature of man will be 
forced to agree that all perils, all ills, however great they may be, 
dwindle with distance and appear less dreadful than minor dangers 
when these are close at hand. It is obvious that the threat of immedi- 


382 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ate punishment is much more effective, much more apt to deter the 
would-be criminal than that of punishments to come. As for mis- 
deeds that lie outside the scope of the law, are not men far more 
effectively deterred from them by considerations of health, decency, 
reputation, and other such mundane considerations as are apparent 
at the moment than by the dread of future and unending woes 
which seldom enter the mind, or which, when they do, are always 
vaguely shaped, dimly perceived, and reckoned easy to avoid? 

“In order to judge whether the fear of eternal and rigorous 
punishments in the next: world is more likely to deter men from 
evil than is that of ternmporal and imminent punishments in this 
world, let us for a mornent suppose that, the first of these fears 
subsisting universally, the second were entirely removed; would 
we not perceive the world suddenly flooded with crimes? Now let 
us imagine the opposite let us suppose the fear of eternal punish- 
ments abruptly done away with, and the fear of immediate, palpable 
punishments remaining in full force: while we saw these punish- 
ments being meted out unfailingly everywhere, would we not also 
notice that they were making.a much deeper impression upon the 
minds of men and were having a much greater influence upon their 
behavior than the remote punishments of the future which one 
forgets all about as soor as the passions start asserting themselves ? 

“Daily experience furnishes us, does it not, plentiful and con- 
vincing proof of the slight effect the fear of punishments in the next 
world has upon those very persons who believe most staunchly 
in them. The dogma of eternal sufferings has had particular success 
with the Spanish, the Portuguese, and the Italians; are there any 
more dissolute peoples! Where does one find more secret crimes 
committed than among priests and monks, that is, among those 
who you would think were thoroughly penetrated with religious 
truths ? Indubitable evidence, this, that the good effects produced by 
the eternal-punishments dogma are very rare and very uncertain. 
We are about to see that its ill effects are innumerable and definite. 
Such a doctrine, inevitably filling the soul with bitterness, cannot 
help but fill the mind with images showing the Divinity in the worst 
light; it hardens the heart and hurls it into a despair most disad- 
vantageous to the Divinity, belief in whom you mean to bolster by 
means of this doctrine. Quite the contrary, this frightful dogma 


Juliette 383 


fosters atheism, impiety, every right-thinking and decent person 
finding it a great deal simpler and more convenient not to believe 
in God at all, rather than acknowledge one so cruel, so inconsistent, 
so barbaric, as to have created men solely in order to sink them 
in perpetual misfortune, grief, and anguish. 

“If you insist upon having God as the basis for your religion, 
at least endeavor to compose a flawless God; for if he is riddled 
with defects, as yours is, the religion based upon him will soon 
coime into disrepute, and you'll discover you’ve spoiled each in- 
gredient by unskillful blending of the two. 

“Do you really suppose it is possible that a religion can be 
believed for long, respected for long, when it is founded upon 
belief in a God who, according to the rules of the game, must punish 
a huge—an infinite—number of his creatures for behavior to which 
that God put them up? Any man who accredits such an arrangement 
must necessarily live in constant fear of the being who has the power 
to make him eternally wretched; with that understood, how can 
he ever love or respect such a being? Were a son to imagine his 
father capable of condemning him to such cruel tortures or of not 
wishing to spare him these sufferings if the matter lay in his hands, 
would that son feel much respect or love for that father? Are not 
the creatures God has made entitled to expect still more by way of 
kindness from him than may children from even the most indulgent 
father ? is it not men’s belief, that all the good things of this world 
are theirs through the goodness of their God; that this God is their 
guide and protector; that ’tis he who will later procure them the 
happiness whereof they are in hope; are not all these the assump- 
tions which serve as foundation to a religion? And if you blast them, 
goodbye religion; whence you see that your idiotic hell dogma 
wrecks instead of consolidates, that it loosens the underpinnings of 
the cult instead of tightening them, and that, as a consequence, 
only dolts have ever been able to believe something only knaves 
could have invented. 

‘No question about it, this being, concerning whom there is 
so much unending chatter, is sullied, dishonored by the ridiculous 
colors his portraitists habitually employ; did they not entertain 
senseless and incoherent ideas of the Divinity, they’d not represent 
him as cruel; and did they not think him cruel, they’d not fancy him 


384 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


capable of punishing them by infinite torments, or even able to 
consent that man be deprived eternally of happiness. 

“To elude the force of this argument, partisans of the dogma 
of eternal damnation.afhirm that the sore affliction of the reprobate 
is not arbitrary punishment on God’s part, but a consequence of sin 
and the immutable order of things. Indeed? Who told you so? If 
you claim this to be a teaching out of Scripture, you'll have an 
awkard time proving it; and if you manage to happen across a single 
passage where there is scme allusion to the matter, oh! the lengths 
to which you shall have to go in order to convince me of the au- 
thenticity, the accuracy, the holiness of these few lines which look 
to you as though they read in your favor. Were they your rational 
faculties which suggested this atrocious dogma to you? In that case, 
tell me how you manage to conciliate reason with the injustice of a 
God who confections a c-eature, all the time knowing full well that 
the ironclad, immutable shape and design of things is such as will 
for a certainty forever sink him in an ocean of unremitting woes. 
If it is true that the universe is created and ruled over by a being 
infinitely powerful, infinitely wise, then everything must necessarily 
pass in conformance to kis will, coincide with his aims, and conspire 
to the well-being of all that dwells therein. Now in what way does 
it further the advantage of the universe that a frail and miserable 
and helpless creature undergo eternal torture as a punishment for 
errors he never committed of his own free will ? 

“If the vast host of sinners and infidels and unbelievers were 
really destined to suffer cruel and perpetual torments—what a 
horrible propect for maikind! Billions of human beings mercilessly 
condemned to agonies without end . . . were it so, indeed, then the 
lot of man, this thinking and sensitive being, would be truly hideous. 
For is there not grief a:id sorrow enough he must face in this life, 
that he must expect morz pain and worse anguish when his career on 
earth is done? What horror! Oh, ’tis execrable! However can such 
ideas make their way into the human mind, how is one to avoid the 
conviction that where they are in currency there lurk imposture, 
lies, and barbarous politics? Ah! let us be ever more firmly aware 
that this doctrine, neither useful nor necessary and utterly in- 
effectual as a means for dissuading men from evil, can be made into 
the basis for one and only one kind of religion: that whose sole

purpose is to keep slaves at heel; let us clearly understand that 
the unvarying consequences of this abominable dogma are sinister 
and unwholesome in the extreme, since it is capable only of trans- 
forming life into a nightmare of bitterness, horrors, tears, and 
alarms; and breeds such notions of the Divinity that, save he be 
paralyzed totally and undone, the individual has no choice but to 
curse God and a faith wherein belief is tantamount to final de- 
gradation.” 

‘‘Assuredly, if we believe the universe created and governed 
by a being whose might, wisdom, and goodness are infinite, we are 
obliged to conclude that all evil must necessarily be excluded from 
this universe; well, you will not gainsay that the eternal unhappi- 
ness of most of the individuals embraced in the human species would 
constitute a positive and absolute evil. Fie! what an infamous role 
you give your infamous God to play by supposing him guilty of 
such barbarity. To be brief, eternal torturings combine very ill with 
the infinite goodness of the God you have in mind: so either cease 
trying to make me believe therein, or get rid of your savage dogma 
of sufferings everlasting, do one or the other if you seriously wish 
to see me adopt your God for a single instant. Rejecting the dogma 
of hell, we may likewise dismiss the other of paradise; both are the 
wicked inventions of theological despots who by terrorizing men’s 
minds strove to ensure their obedience to sovereigns. Let us be 
assured of it: that we are made of matter only, that what is im- 

150 thou! who, ’tis alleged, hast created all that in the world there be; thou, 
of whom I have no certain conception, none, not even the tiniest; thou whom I know 
of through divers readings and through what mortal men, who are every day in 
error, may have told me about thee; thou weird and fantastical being denominated 
God, I formally declare herewith, authentically and publicly, that in thee I have not 
the faintest hint of belief, and this for the excellent reason that nowhere, neither in 
my heart nor in my mind nor in my soul, do I find anything that persuades me of an 
absurd existence, evidence for the reality of which is absolutely lacking in the outside 
world also. If I am mistaken, and if when I am come to the end of my days thou 
shalt prove me wrong, and if then (which is so doubtful, being in contradiction to 
all the laws of probability and logic) thou shalt convince me of this existence I so 
stoutly deny now, what will happen? Thou shalt render happiness to me or unhap- 
piness. Thou makest me happy, then I shall acknowledge thee, I shall cherish thee; 
if unhappy, then I shall abhor and hate thee; since ’tis obvious no reasonable man 
can reckon otherwise, how is it, with the power that is said to constitute the fore- 


most of thine attributes, if thou dost exist, how, I say, canst thou allow man an option 
so damaging to thy glory?

material is inexistent; that all we attribute to the soul is all simply 
the effect of matter; and this in spite of our human pride which 
causes us to stress the distinction between ourselves and brute beasts 
however it be that, like beasts, we yield up to the dust the dust 
whereof we are made, and when dead shall be no more punished 
than they for the bad deeds which the kind of organization we have 
received from Nature has induced us to commit, nor more rewarded 
for the good deeds we perform simply because we have been other- 
wise structured. And so, as regards the fate awaiting you after 
this life, whether you conduct yourself well or ill, it amounts to the 
same; and if we shall have succeeded in passing every single instant 
of the term allotted us amidst pleasures, even though this manner 
of existence may have been unruly, may have caused disturbance 
to everybody about us, hav@ gone counter to every social conven- 
tion; if, I say, we shall have shielded ourselves from the law—and 
this is encumbent upon 11s, it is the one essential—then most as- 
suredly, most certainly we shall have done far better, been far 
happier than the fool who, from awful dread of punishments in 
an afterlife, has in this one rigorously eschewed everything which 
might have gladdened and afforded him delectation; for it is of 
infinitely greater importance to achieve happiness in this life 
whereof we are sure, than to forego the indisputable joys offered 
us here and now in the hope of acceding to imaginary ones of which 
we have not, and cannot possibly have, the faintest idea. Eh! he 
must have been a prodiyiously droll fellow, he who attempted to 
persuade men that they riay become unhappier when dead than they 
were before they were born! Has anyone ever asked to enter into 
this world? Do men endow themselves with the passions which, 
according to your gruesome creed, hurl them into eternal woes in the 
next world? Why no! not at all, none of this is the individual’s do- 
ing, it is all done to hirn, if fault there be it is not his, and it is 
unthinkable, it is fantastic, it is false that he can be punished there- 
fore. 

“But have we not to cast a glance at our miserable species 
to ascertain that there is no hint here of immortality? What! this 
divine quality, or let us rather say, this quality which cannot possibly 
exist in matter, am I to understand that any such thing could be- 
long to this animal we call man? He who feeds, drinks, and repro- 


Juliette %& 387 


duces like beasts, whose superiority over them resides in a somewhat 
more refined instinct, this creature is able to expect a fate so unlike 
any of those same beasts? who will accept such nonsense for a 
minute ? But hold, they protest, man has achieved the sublime aware- 
ness of his God; this in itself betokens worthiness of the immortality 
he dreams of. Ah. And what is so sublime about this awareness of 
a spook, unless you wish to imply that because man has carried his 
ravings over a particular subject to their final conclusion, he must 
now rave in connection with everything else? O poor wretch! if 
thou hast some advantage over animals, how many are their ad- 
vantages over thee? Art thou not susceptible to a hundred times 
as many infirmities or diseases? Art thou not the victim.of a hun- 
dred times as many passions? Weigh it up and tell me whether, in 
the over-all, man is really better off than the beast. Do you find 
that the scales still tip in his favor? And this slight advantage you 
accord him, is it so great as to warrant his proud notion that he 
is due eternally to outlive his four-footed brethren? O pitiful hu- 
manity, look to what lengths of folly thou hast been urged by thine 
inflated self-esteem! And when thou shalt make riddance of all 
these chimeras which obstruct thy view, shalt not thou see thyself 
as no more than a beast, thy God as merely the ne plus ultra of hu- 
man extravagance, and this life but a road passing from nought to 
nought, and which thou mayest travel as thou wilst, in vice as con- 
fidently as in virtue? 

“But with your leave I shall deepen the discussion and enter 
more thoroughly into the knotty questions confronting us now. 

“Certain Church Fathers maintain that Jesus descended into 
hell. How often this contention has been attacked and refuted! 
We shall not catalogue and inspect severally the various theses 
which have treated of this subject: the philosophical spirit—and 
we address ourselves to no other—would very probably make short 
work of them. The facts are these: neither Scripture nor any of its 
commentaries is positively decided either upon the specific where- 
abouts of hell or upon the precise tortures you undergo there. 
This being granted, we next find that the Word of God clarifies 
nothing, whereas the teaching of Scripture, we all agree, ought to 
be plainly and distinctly set forth, above all as regards a matter 
of such high consequence. However, research fails to discover 


388 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


either in the Hebrew text or in the Greek and Latin versions, a 
single word designating hell in its traditionally or still currently 
accepted meaning: that ’s, a place reserved for the torture of 
sinners. Is this not very telling evidence against the soundness of the 
opinion held by those who maintain that these tortures really exist? 
If Scripture omits any mention of hell, by what right, pray tell, do 
they presume to entertain such a notion? Are we bound, in religious 
questions, to believe anything over and beyond what is written? 
Well, if this opinion appears nowhere in writing, in pursuance of 
what are we-to adopt it? It does not beseem us to trouble our minds 
about what has not been revealed; and whatever has not been we 
cannot legitimately regard as other than fable, vague supposition, 
human tradition, imposture’s inventions. Scholarship discloses 
nevertheless that near Jerusalem there was a locality known as the 
valley of Gehenna, where criminals were put to death and into 
which the corpses of anirials were thrown also. It is to this place 
Jesus refers in his allegories when he says, Illic erit fletus et stridor 
dentium. This was a vale of tears, of suffering and horror : and there 
appears to be no doubt it is to Gehenna he is alluding in his parables, 
in his unintelligible speeches. Our belief receives further confirma- 
tion from the fact that torture by fire was practiced in this valley: 
there the guilty were burnt alive; at other times they were buried 
to the knees in dung. Or round their neck was looped a length of 
cloth whose ends were pulled by two men, so strangling the victim 
and forcing him to oper. his mouth into which molten lead was 
poured—there we have the fire, the torture, whereof the Galilean 
spoke. We often hear him say that such and such a sin merits punish- 
ment by fire, that is, the miscreant deserves to be burnt in the valley 
of Gehenna or flung upon the dung heap and burned with the ani- 
mal carrion that was dumped in this noisome awful place. But, 
you may point out, the adjective eternal Jesus frequently uses to 
qualify this fire, does it not bear out the contention of those who 
believe the flames of hell shall burn forever? By no means. Often 
employed in Scripture, this term eternal always connotes the finite. 
For example, God concluded an eternal alliance with his chosen 
people; nevertheless, this alliance came to an end. The cities of 
Sodom and Gomorrah were to burn eternally; but that blaze died 


Juliette %& 389 


out a good long while ago.’® Furthermore, it is common knowl- 
edge that the fire in the valley of Gehenna, near Jerusalem, was kept 
lit by night and by day. We also know that great use is made of hy- 
perbole in Scripture, and that not a line of it should be taken 
literally. These exaggerations are enough; must one go a step 
farther, as is regularly done, and twist the underlying meaning of 
things? Indeed, must not such magnifiers be regarded as the most 
definite enemies of good sense and reason? 

“But what then is the nature of the fire they menace us with? 
(1) It cannot be tangible, because we are told our fire is but a faint 
image of it; (2) a tangible fire illuminates the area surrounding 
it, and we are assured that hell is a tenebrous place; (3) tangible 
fire promptly consumes all combustible materials, and finally con- 
sumes itself, instead of which hellfire must last indefinitely and 
consume eternally; (4) hellfire is invisible, hence it is not at all 
tangible; (5) tangible fire goes out for lack of fuel, and, ac- 
cording to our absurd religion, hellfire will burn forever; (6) hell- 
fire is eternal, tangible fire is temporary; (7) it is said that the 
worst of the torments the damned have to endure is the privation 
of God; however, in this life experience ‘shows that tangible fire 
can be far more painful than the absence of God. 

“8) Lastly, tangible fire can have no effect upon spirits, 
therefore hellfire can have no effect upon them. To say that God 
can contrive in such a way that a material fire acts upon spiritual 
beings; that he will make these spirits to live and subsist without 
sustenance, and that he will make the fire to burn without com- 
bustibles—this is to resort to wonderful suppositions for which 
there is no warrant apart from the idle reveries of theologians, 
and which consequently prove only their stupidity or their wicked- 
ness. 

“To come to the conclusion that, because nothing is impossible 
for God, God will do everything possible is surely no very logical 
way of reasoning. Men would be well advised to refrain from 
basing their fond hopes upon God’s omnipotence, when they do not 

16 Lacus Asphaltites presently covers the site of Sodom and Gomorrah, neither of 
which is afire any more; the flames sometimes noticed thereabouts come from volcanoes 


in the vicinity, quite as Etna and Vesuvius yet smolder and erupt fire, The cities 
in question never burned in any other way. 


390 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


even know what God is. In order to elude these difficulties, other 
theologians assure us that hellfire is not tangible at all, no, accord- 
ing to them it is spiritual. Perhaps you will be good enough to tell 
me, what is a spiritual fire? what is an immaterial, incorporeal, non- 
substantial fire? Some there are who speak to us of such a thing; 
what do you fancy they are talking about? do you suppose they 
themselves have the slightest idea? where, in what connection, upon 
what occasion does their God explain to them the nature of their 
fire? Again, however, we find a few doctors who, hunting for a 
happy medium, assert that this fire is partly spiritual, partly ma- 
terial. Which gives us, oh behold! two different sorts of fire in hell; 
how preposterous! What devices is superstition not driven to re- 
sort to as it constructs its sand-castles of falsehood ! 

“And likewise, wher. pressed to produce something plausible 
concerning the location of this fabulous hell, what an outrageous 
higgledy-piggledy of farfetched speculations has been invented! 
The prevailing feeling had been that hell lay in a region somewhere 
below the earth; but where is that region in relation to a revolving 
globe? Others, recognizing the world as round, placed hell at its 
center, that is, some fifteen hundred leagues from where we are 
standing now; but if Scripture says true, the world is going to be 
destroyed, and where will hell be when that comes to pass? Well, 
you observe the wild nonsense that results when one puts one’s 
faith in the ravings of cthers. Less extravagant reasoners claim, 
as I mentioned a moment ago, that hell consists in being barred 
from the vision of God; in which case hell starts right here in this 
world, for hereabouts th:zre’s neither hide nor hair of that God to 
be seen: and yet this state of affairs can hardly, you'll agree, be 
called unendurable. One is tempted to imagine the reverse: if this 
queer God did truly exist such as he is depicted to us, the mere 
sight of him would probably constitute a very adequate image of 
hell. 

“All these incertituc.es and the scanty concordance amongst the 
theologians indicate that the latter are wandering about in a fog 
and a delusion and, like clrunkards, are unable to get their bearings, 
let alone keep their footing; and nevertheless, is it not curious that 
they cannot come to some manner of terms over so essential a 


Juliette & 391 


dogma, and one which, they say, is so clearly expounded in the 
Word of God? 

‘So, shavepate rabble, own that this gigantic grisly dogma of 
yours is utterly baseless, all made up, that it is the product of your 
greed, your ambition, and sired by your unhinged mentalities; that 
it cannot stand unless crutched up by the ignorant terrors of the 
vulgar simpleton you train to swallow, uncritically, everything you 
are pleased to serve up to him. Admit that this hell exists nowhere 
but in your brain, and that the infernal tortures you brandish are 
so many anxieties it suits your political convenience to inflict upon 
the mortals who let themselves be guided by you. Aware of these 
facts, let us forever abjure a doctrine which only affrights .men, 
constitutes an insult to the godhead, and, in a word, must be re- 
pudiated by any reasoning person. 

‘Various arguments are yet put forward; I think it incumbent 
upon me to combat them. (1) The fear which, they say, everyone 
senses inwardly of some punishment to come.is an indubitable proof 
of that punishment’s reality. But this fear is by no means innate; 
it is inculcated, fostered by education; it is not in every land the 
same, nor the same in all men; it is not found amongst those in 
whom passions have annihilated prejudice; the conscience is never 
modified save by instruction, by ruling passions, by habit. 

2) The pagans acknowledged the dogma of hell. . . . Surely 
not as do we; and supposing that they might have acknowledged 
it, we who reject their religion, must we not reject their dogmas as 
well? But it is very certain the pagans never believed in an afterlife 
of everlasting sufferings; nor in the pathetic claptrap of the resur- 
rection of bodies, which they burned on pyres, and whose ashes they 
preserved in urns; they did believe in metempsychosis, in the trans- 
migration also of bodies, ideas for which there is a great deal to be 
said ard which natural studies repeatedly confirm; but the absurd 
conceit of bodily resurrection, very worthy of Christianity, belongs 
entirely to it. It would strongly appear that our doctors got their 
notions of a nether world, of paradise, and of purgatory out of 
Plato and Virgil, and that they then shaped them to suit their 
own purposes: nebulous vagaries of poetical fancy were in time 
changed into articles of faith. . 

3) If there is such a thing as sanity and healthy reason, then 


392 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the dogma of a hell and of eternal punishment is necessarily proven 
true. God is just, therefore he must punish men for their crimes. 
. . . No, and no again; never could sanity, never could healthy 
reason subscribe to a dogma which so blatantly outrages it. 

4) But God is a judge, his justice must be done. . . . Another 
atrocity: evil is necessary on earth. I say unto you that if your 
God exists, his justice cannot consist in punishing deeds he has him- 
self prescribed; if he is omnipotent, your God, has he need of pun- 
ishing the evildoer in order to prevent the doing of evil? Could he 
not, can he not today, deprive men altogether of the capacity for 
evil? If he did not do this originally, if he will not do it tomorrow, 
it is because he conside::s evil necessary to the maintenance of 
general harmony; and in the light of this, how, vile blasphemers ! 
how dare you say God cz.n punish a mode of behavior which must 
exist if the universe is to run aright? 

“5) All theologians concur in believing and preaching the 
existence of the punishments of hell. . . . Does this prove anything 
except that the priests, lsually so disunited, are nonetheless very 
able to reach an understanding whenever it is a question of deceiv- 
ing their flocks? Furthermore, must the ambitious and calculating 
inventions of Romish clerics dictate what the opinions of other 
sects are to be? Is it reasonable to expect the whole of mankind to 
believe what a grubby little minority found it advantageous to de- 
vise and proclaim? Must one then rather place one’s faith in these 
cheats than in reason, common sense, and truth? It is by truth we 
should be ruled, not by the mob; far better to rely upon one man 
who speaks true than to heed the knaves who have been spouting 
lies for centuries. 

“The other arguments they advance are all so patently weak 
that one has difficulty taking them seriously and little inclination 
to waste one’s time refuting them; none of them reposing either 
upon Scripture or upon tradition, they all necessarily collapse of 
themselves. For example, unanimous consent is alleged; but can it 
be, when it is impossible to find any two individuals who follow the 
same line of reasoning about what is apparently one of the most 
important things in life ? 

“Realizing they have not a single sound argument on their 
side, these fierce priests are always fully prepared to threaten you; 


Juliette %& 393 


despite the fact that, as everybody knows by now, threats are the 
weapons of the simple-minded, the feeble, and the defeated. Come, 
come, silly little children of Jesus! give us reasons, yes, it is reasons 
we want out of you, not bluster, rant, and fist-shakings: we do not 
wish to be told, ‘Since you do not choose to believe in these tortures, 
you are going to feel them’; we merely ask, and with this request you 
cannot successfully comply: demonstrate to us that by virtue of 
which you would have us believe in your fictions. 

“The fear of hell, in short, is no sure guarantee against sin. 
... Nothing, anywhere, authorizes any such fear. ... It is only too 
obviously the fruit of the diseased imagination of priests, of, that is, 
those personages who comprise the vilest and the most mischievous 
class in society. So what purpose does the hell myth serve? I put 
anyone at defiance to tell me. They assure us that sin is an infinite 
wrong and ought hence to be punished infinitely. Rubbish. God him- 
self chose to prescribe a finite punishment for this crime, and that 
punishment is death. 

“And so we conclude that the puerile dogma of hell is a fairy 
tale of sacerdotal contrivance, a cruel supposition hazarded by 
gowned rascals who began by fabricating a dreary, a disgusting 
God in their own image, in order then to have this loathsome 
dummy repeat what sorted best with their own passions and, above 
all, to repeat whatever was most likely to procure them whores or 
money, the sole objects ambitioned by that covetous, that shiftless 
lot, that crew of social outcasts whereof society would be wonder- 
fully well advised to purge itself definitively.” 

“T say unto you, banish forever from your heart this doctrine 
which is an insult to your God and your reason alike. Such beyond

any doubt is the dogma that has produced more atheists than all the 
others combined, there being not a single man on earth who would 
not prefer to believe nothing whatsoever rather than subscribe to 
this confusion of peculiarly dangerous lies; this is the explanation 
for why so many upright and decent souls consider themselves 
obliged to repair to thoroughgoing irreligion in their search for re- 
lief from, and defense against, the terrors wherewith an infamous 
Christian creed would lav waste their energies and all their peace 
of mind. So let’s be rid of these false alarms; let’s forever have 
done with the dogmas, the ceremonies, the rites of this abominable 
religion. Better the most inveterate, the most incorrigible atheism 
than a cult so fraught with perils so immense. Indeed, I am aware 
of no drawback in not having any belief at all; but I see nothing but 
disadvantages of the verv gravest order arising from the adoption 
of these dangerous systems. 

“There, my dear Saint-Fond, I have presented my views 
touching this infamous hell dogma. Let it terrify you and chill 
your pleasures no more. “or mortal man there is but one hell, and 
that is the folly and wickedness and spite of his fellows; but once 
his life is over, there’s an end to it: his annihilation is final and 
entire, of him nothing survives. Ah, what a prodigious dupe he must 
therefore be, who denies himself a single pleasure or curbs his 
passions for a moment! Let him realize that he exists purely for 
their satisfaction througii whatever excesses this may entail, and 
that all the effects of these passions, in whatever kind or shape they 
may have been implanted in him, are the means whereby you serve 
the Nature whose agents we at all times are, whether we are con- 
scious of it or no, whether we will or no. And now I hand you back 
the idea of a God which I made brief use of as an instrument for 
combating the eternal-punishment scare; but there is no God, he 
does not any more exist tnan does the devil, than heaven, than hell; 
and the only duties we have in this world are those toward our 
pleasures, which we are to satisfy without regard to the interests of 
others, for we are bound, aye, duty-bound to sacrifice any of them 
and, if need be, all of them if the least of our desires would have 
it so. 

“TI trust I have said enough to prove the absurdity of the 
principle upon which you base your pointless cruelty. Must I speak 


Juliette & 395 


of the means you employ? No, to be honest with you, it isn’t worth 
the trouble; how, in the first place, how have you ever cgme to 
think that a signature scribbled in blood can be more binding, less 
worthless, than one in ink, or none? That, next, this scrap of paper 
stuffed into a bum can serve as a passport to heaven or to hell, 
neither of which exists? "Tis here a patchwork of prejudices so 
ridiculous as truly does not deserve the honor of critical dissection 
or disproving. For the voluptuous idea that’s made you giddy, this 
idea of prolonging the sufferings of a given individual, for it sub- 
stitute a greater abundance of murders, I beseech you; cease killing 
the same individual a thousand times over, which is impossible; 
instead, assassinate individuals by the thousand, which is altogether 
feasible. Is there anything so mean-spirited as confining oneself to 
half a dozen victims a week? Trust Juliette, she is clever, she is 
capable, only say the word and she will double the number, triple 
it, give her the required money; you'll want for nothing, your 
passions will be satisfied.” 

“Splendid,” Saint-Fond replied, “I heartily welcome this last 
conclusion; from now on, Juliette, we shall have not three victims 
per supper, but six, and the suppers shall be held twice as frequently 
as heretofore, which will mean twenty-four victims a week, a third 
of them men, two-thirds women. Your fees shall be augmented 
proportionally; however, Mesdames, I cannot confess having been 
vanquished by this learned dissertation upon the nullity of infernal 
punishments. I admire the erudition it displays, its aim, certain of 
its implications and consequences : but bow before it, this I cannot 
do, and to what you have advanced I should like to answer as 
follows. 

“First of all, throughout your entire argument I observe an 
effort to exculpate God from the barbarity of the dogma of hell. If 
God exists, you seem to be saying in virtually every sentence, the 
qualities which he must possess are every one of them incompatible 
with this execrable dogma. But, my dear Clairwil, it is precisely here 
that I feel you fall into heaviest error, and this for want of a 
philosophy comprehensive enough. luminous enough, to enable you 
to behold the subject properly. The hell dogma creates a hindrance 
to your pleasures, and from there you go on to assert that hell 
there is none; facts must be-established upon something more solid: 


396 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


than personal wishes. To combat the dogma of eternal penalties 
you begin by gratuitously destroying everything it rests upon: there 
is no God, we do not have souls, hence there are no sufferings to 
dread in a life after this. It strikes me that you start at the very 
outset by committing the greatest blunder one can commit in logic: 
to posit as granted that which is in question. Far from sharing your 
way of thinking, I acknowledge a Supreme Being and yet more 
firmly believe in the immortality of the soul. But let not your pious 
hearts, enchanted by these initial declarations, run on to suppose 
they have a proselyte in me; I am not so sure my doctrine will prove 
to their liking. You yourselves may find it odd. Never mind; I 
should like to expound it to you all the same, and I am sure I can 
count upon a fair hearing’. 

“I raise up my eyes to the universe: I see evil, disorder, crime 
reigning as despots everywhere. My gaze descends, and it bends 
upon that most interesting of this universe’s creatures: I behold 
him likewise devoured by vices, by contradictions, by infamies; what 
ideas result from this examination? That what we improperly call 
evil is really not evil at all, and that this mode is of such high 
necessity to the designs of the being who has created us that he 
would cease to be the master of his own creation were evil not to 
exist universally upon the earth. Well persuaded that this is so, I 
tell myself: there exists 2 God; some hand or other has necessarily 
created all that I see, but has not created it save for evil, is not 
pleased but by evil; evil is his essence, and all that he causes us to 
commit is indispensable 0 his plans. What matters it to him that I 
suffer from this evil, provided it be advantageous to him? Does it 
not seem I am his favor'te child? If the misfortunes that afflict me 
from the day I am born until the day I die prove his indifference to 
me, I may very well be mistaken upon what I call evil. What I thus 
characterize relative to rnyself seems indeed to be a very great good 
relative to the being who has brought me into the world; and if I 
receive evil from others, I enjoy the right to pay them back in kind, 
to be the first to cast the stone: so, henceforth, evil is good, just as 
it is for the author of my existence, relatively to my existence: the 
evil I do others makes me happy, as God is rendered happy by the 
evil he does me. All confusion and error are gone save in the idea 
attributed to the word; but in the deed, there is both evil as neces- 


Juliette 397 


sity and evil as pleasure; henceforth, why ought I not call it good? 

“Be sure of it: evil, or at least what goes by that name, is 
absolutely useful to the vicious organization of this melancholy 
universe. The God who has articulated it is a very vindictive being, 
very barbarous, very wicked, very unjust, very cruel; that, because 
vengeance, barbarity, wickedness, iniquity, criminality are the neces- 
sary modes, vital to the principle that governs this vast creation, of 
which we only complain when it brings us hurt: to its victims, crime 
is bad; to its agents, good. Now, if evil, or at least what we call 
such, is the essence both of God who has created everything and of 
the creatures wrought in his image, how can one be anything but 
certain that the consequences of evil are eternal? It is in evil he 
made the world, by evil he does sustain it; it is for evil he per- 
petuates it; it is impregnated with evil that creation must exist; it is 
into the womb of evil it returns after its term. Man’s soul is merely 
the action of evil upon a subtle matter, susceptible of being organ- 
ized only by evil; now, this mode being the soul of the Creator as 
it is of the being created, just as it existed before this created being 
that is saturated with it, so it will exist after that created being is 
no more. All, everyone has got to be wicked, barbarous, inhuman, 
like your God: these are the vices the person who wishes to please 
him must adopt, without, nevertheless, any hope of succeeding: for 
the evil which harms always, the evil which is the essence of God, 
will never be, can never be susceptible of love nor of gratitude. If 
this God, center of evil and of ferocity, torments man and has him 
tormented by Nature and by other men throughout the whole 
period of his existence, how may one doubt that he acts likewise and 
perhaps involuntarily upon this breath of air which outlives him 
and which, as I have just said, is nothing other than evil itself? But 
how, you are going to object, how may evil be tormented by evil? 
Because when it encounters itself, it is increased, and because the 
force that yields must always be obliterated by the force that com- 
pels it to yield—which is in accordance with the logic wherein 
weakness is always subjugated by strength. That which survives the 
naturally evil being, that which must survive him, since it is the 
essence of the being’s constitution, an essence whose existence is 
prior to the being and which will exist after the being, by falling 
back into the womb of evil, and because of its relative weakness no

longer having the strength to defend itself, will hence be tormented 
by the entire essence of evil, to which it will be reunited ; they are 
these maleficent molecules that, in the operation of comipassing and 
assimilating those which what we call death reunites to them, com- 
pose what poets and others of ardent imagination have named 
demons. No man, whatever be his conduct in this world, can escape 
this terrible fate, because it is necessary that everything that ema- 
nates from the womb of Nature, that is to say, from the womb of 
evil, return thereunto: sich is the universal law. Thus are the de- 
testable elements of the wicked man absorbed into the source of 
wickedness, which is God, to return again and to animate other 
beings which will be born that much more corrupted, in as they will 
be the fruit of corruption. 

‘What, you may wonder, what has become of the good being? 
But there is no such thing as a good being: he whom you call 
virtuous is not by any means good, or, if he is from your viewpoint, 
he surely is not from the viewpoint of God, who is only evil, who 
wants nothing but what is evil, who requires evil alone. The man 
you speak of is merely feeble, and feebleness is an evil. Weaker than 
the absolutely and entirely vicious being, and more completely. en- 
gulfed by the maleficent molecules with which his elementary disso- 
lution will conjoin him, this man will have to suffer a great deal 
more: and there, precisely, is what ought to oblige every man to 
render himself in this world as vicious and wicked as possible in 
order that, more like unto the molecules wherewith he must some- 
day contend, he have, in this act of reunion, infinitely less to suffer 
from their onslaught. The ant that were to fall into the midst of 
wild animals, where there prevails such violence as must overwhelm 
any insect, would, because of its radical defenselessness, have an 
infinitely more painful time of it than might some large beast which, 
stronger, more resourceful, better able to resist, would only gradu- 
ally become swallowed up into the whirlpool]. The more vices and 
crimes a man would have manifested in this world, the more he will 
be in harmony with his ineluctable fate, which is wickedness, which I 
consider the primary matter of the world’s composition. Let man 
then take care to preserve himself well from virtue if he should like 
to avoid exposure to th: most hideous sufferings; for virtue being 
the mode hostile to the world’s system, all those who will have 


Juliette 3% 399 


yielded to it are certain to endure, after this life, the most unspeak- 
able torments by reason of the difficulty they will experience in 
re-entering the womb of evil, author and regenerator of all we 
behold. 

“Having seen that all was vicious and criminal on earth, the 
Being Supreme in Wickedness will say unto them, ‘Why did you 
stray into the paths of virtue? Did I ever announce to you, by any 
token, that this mode was agreeable to me? Did not the perpetual 
miseries with which I inundated the universe convince you that I 
love only disorder, and that to please me one must emulate me? 
Did I not set grandly before you every day the example of destruc- 
tion? Why did you heed it not? Did not the plagues wherewith [| 
withered the earth, by proving to you that evil was my joy, enjoin 
you to perform evil acts in the service of my scheme? Now were you 
not aware that humankind must satisfy me; and in what aspect of 
my conduct have you noticed benevolence? Is it in sending you 
plagues, blights, civil wars, earthquakes, tempests ? is it by brandish- 
ing above your heads all the serpents of discord that I persuade you 
that my essence is good? Fool! why did you not imitate my ways? 
Why did you resist’those passions I put in you for no reason other 
than to prove to you how great is the necessity for evil? Their voice 
was to have been heard and obeyed; it was necessary to despoil piti- 
lessly, as I do, the widow and the orphan, to pillage the poor, in one 
word, to make man comply with all your needs, bend before all 
your caprices—as I do. After having played the idiot and taken 
the contrary way, what have you come back here for? And how 
are the soft, flabby elements, emanating from your dissolution, 
how, I ask, without being shattered and without occasioning you 
the most excruciating agonies, are they to return now into the womb 
of maleficence and crime?” 

“More of a philosopher than you, Clairwil, I do not have to 
apply, as you seem obliged to do, either to that rogue Jesus or to 
that insipid novel, Holy Scripture, in order to demonstrate my 
system; my study of the universe alone provides me with weapons 
to oppose you, and simply from the manner in which it is governed 
I see eternal and universal evil as absolutely indispensable in the 
world. The author of the universe is the most wicked, the most 
ferocious, the most horrifying of all beings. His works cannot be 


400 ch THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


anything but the result or the incarnation of his criminality. 
Without his wickedness raised to its extremest pitch, nothing would 
be sustained in the universe; evil is, however, a moral entity and not 
a created one, an eternal and not a perishable entity: it existed 
before the world; it constituted the monstrous, the execrable being 
who was able to fashion such a hideous world. It will hence exist 
after the creatures which people this world; it is unto evil they will 
all enter again, in order to re-create others perhaps more wicked 
yet, and that is why they say all is degraded, all is corrupted in old 
age. that stems only from the perpetual re-entry and emergence of 
wicked elements into and out of the matrix of maleficent molecules. 

“You are now perhaps going to ask me how, within this 
hypothesis, I rationalize the possibility of causing a person to suffer 
for a longer period of time by means of a bit of paper introduced 
into the anus. It is the simplest thing in the world, and I dare say the 
surest and least refutable as well; if I have been pleased to call it 
a weakness, it is because I had no idea you would ever get me into 
the position of disclosing my doctrines to you. I'll defend my 
method, however, and prove its worth. 

“When my victims arrive in evil’s womb, they come bearing 
evidence that in my hands they have endured all the suffering it is 
possible to endure; they are then classified as virtuous beings. 
Through my operation they are made better, improved; their ad- 
junction to the maleficent molecules is rendered exceedingly difh- 
cult; their agonies, heace, are enormous; and by the laws of 
attraction essential to Nature, they must be, those agonies, of the 
same species as those I caused them to suffer in this world. As the 
magnet draws iron, as beauty whets carnal appetites, so agonies A, 
agonies B, agonies C call to their like, enchain their like. The person 
my hand exterminates by means of agony B will, I suppose, only 
return to the matrix of maleficent molecules via that agony B; and 
if agony B is the most appalling possible, I am sure my victim will 
undergo a similar one in entering the womb of evil which necessarily 
awaits all men and which, by the laws of attraction I just mentioned, 
only accepts them in the same way by which they went out of the 
world. But the instrument . . . merely a formality, I admit . . . use- 
less, futile, perhaps; but a formality which suits me, and which can 


Juliette 401 


have nothing about it contrary to the true meaning, to the assured 
success of my operation.” 

“That,” replied Clairwil, “is the most astonishing, the most 
unusual, I dare say the most bizarre of all the systems yet to have 
occurred to the mind of man.” 

‘‘Less extravagant than the one you’ve just brought to light,” 
answered Saint-Fond; ‘“‘to maintain yours, you are forced either to 
wipe God clean of his faults or to deny him; as for me, I acknowl- 
edge him with all his vices, and indeed in the eyes of those who are 
familiar with all the crimes, all the horrors of this curious being 
whom men only invoke and call good from fear—in the eyes of 
these people, I say, my ideas will appear less irregular than the 
ones you have exposed.” ; 

“Your system,” said Clairwil, ‘arises solely out of your pro- 
found horror of God.” 

“True; I abhor him; but my system is by no means the issue 
of the hatred I have for him; no, it is but the fruit of my intelligence 
and my meditation.” 

“TI,” said Clairwil, ‘would rather not believe in God than 
forge one in order to hate it. Juliette, what do you think of the 
matter ?”’ 

‘‘Profoundly an atheist,” I replied, “arch enemy of the dogma 
of the soul’s immortality, I will always prefer your system to Saint- 
Fond’s; and I prefer the certitude of nothingness to the fear of an. 
eternity of suffering.” 

“There you are,” Saint-Fond rejoined, “always that perfidi- 
ous egoism which is the source of all the mistakes human beings 
make. One arranges one’s schemes according to one’s tastes and 
whims, and always by drifting farther from truth. You've got to 
leave your passions behind when you examine a philosophical 
doctrine.” 

“Ah, Saint-Fond,” said Clairwil, “how easy it would be to 
point out that yours is nothing but the product of those passions 
which you would have one put by when studying. With less cruelty 
in your heart your dogmas would be less sanguinary; and you your- 
self would rather risk the eternal damnation of which you speak 
than renounce the. delicious pleasure of horrifying others with it.” 


402 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Exactly!” I interrupted; “that is his single motive for expos- 
ing his doctrine; nothing but wickedness on his part, but he won’t 
believe it.” 

“I believe you are wrong: and you see perfectly well that my 
actions correspond in every point to my manner of thinking: con- 
vinced that the torture of being reunited with the maleficent mole- 
cules will be quite mild for the person as maleficent as they, I cover 
myself with crimes in this world so as to have less to suffer in the 
next.” 

“As for me,” retorted Clairwil, “I soil myself with them 
because they please me, because I believe them one of the ways of 
serving Nature, and because, since nothing of me is going to survive, 
it matters bloody little how I behave in this world.” 

Thus far had we come in our conversation when we heard a 
carriage enter the courtyard and stop; Noirceuil was announced, 
then introduced. With him he brought a youth of sixteen, never had 
I clapped eyes on one sc: fair. 

“Bless me,” murmured the Minister, “I’ve only this minute 
finished giving these ladies an analysis of hell; could it be that my 
dear Noirceuil arrives to tempt me into meriting it a little ?” 

“Only too true,” Noirceuil returned; ‘‘you might damn your- 
self wondrously at this pretty little chap’s expense, I fetched him 
here for that very purpcse. He is the son of the Marquise de Rose, 
the same whom last werk you sent to the Bastille upon charges— 
what were they? plotting against the Crown?” 

“That was the pretext, as I recall.” 

“And your aim, presumably, was to procure yourself this child 
and perhaps some money besides?” 

“Precisely.” 

‘Then I was not mistaken. At any rate the Marquise, knowing 
of our connections, sought audience with me; I had one of your 
clerks draw up a writ, and this morning she and I had a chat 
together. Here’s the result of our negotiations,” Noirceuil said, 
thrusting young Rose into the Minister’s arms, “fuck and sign. I’ve 
also a hundred thousand crowns to turn over to you.” 

“‘He’s pretty,” said Saint-Fond, kissing the lad, ‘‘exceedingly 
pretty ; but he comes at a bad moment . . . we’ve been up to horrors; 
I’m exhausted.” 


Juliette & 403 


“Tush,” Noirceuil replied, “the boy has all the qualities 
needed to restore you to life, of that I’m certain.” 

Rose and Noirceuil, who had not yet taken supper, joined us 
at table. Saint-Fond said, when the meal was over, that he wished 
to have me on hand while he amused himself with the youth, and. 
he proposed that Noirceuil lie with Clairwil, both of whom seemed 
pleased by the arrangement; and the company retired. 

“I fear I shall have to put you to contribution,” Saint-Fond 
declared, “‘for attractive though this child undeniably is, I foresee 
I'll have trouble stiffening. Unbutton him for me, my pet, roll his 
shirt above his waist and, that’s it, leave his breeches hanging just 
above his knees, quite, that’s the style I adore.” 

And as the ass I bared for his delectation was nothing short 
of luscious, Saint-Fond, polluted by me, kissed it fervidly and long, 
while frigging a juvenile prick we soon saw reach a most creditable 
stand. 

“Suck it,” my lover bade me; “I'll tongue his asshole in the 
meantime. I believe that, between the two of us, we should be able 
to wheedle a discharge out of him.” 

Next, his greed aroused by the thought of the fuck I was 
about to pump forth, Saint-Fond said he would change places with 
me; this we did so dextrously that scarcely had he got the boy’s 
prick in his mouth than he felt it filled by a most abundant ejacula- 
tion; he swallowed every drop down. 

“Oh, Juliette,” he confided to me, smacking his lips, “food for 
the gods, that. I thrive upon no other.” 

Then instructing the boy to get into bed and to await us with- 
out falling asleep, Saint-Fond conducted me to his boudoir. 

“Juliette,” said he, “I must give you the particulars concern- 
ing an affair upon which Noirceuil himself is by no means 
thoroughly informed. 

“The Marquise de Rose, one of the most beautiful women of 
the Court, was once my mistress, and the child Noirceuil brought 
here this evening is mine. I became interested in him two years ago, 
for two years the Marquise prevented me from satisfying a passion: 
and I was obliged to bide my time until my position was strong 
enough to permit me to act without risk. It was not until recently, 
my prestige and credit towering upon the shattered remnants of 


404 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


hers, that I judged the occasion ripe; my grievances are two: I 
resent having fucked her, I resent having been kept from fucking 
her son. Now she trembles; she sends the boy to me, but he arrives 
rather late in the day: for eighteen months I discharged at the 
very thought of him, but such enthusiasms are never maintained 
indefinitely, and I find that this one, if it has not completely dis- 
appeared, has ebbed very significantly; however, this adventure 
retains certain other criminal possibilities which I owe it to myself 
not to leave unexplored. Oh, yes, I am perfectly willing to pocket 
the Marquise’s hundred thousand, I am nothing loath to fuck her 
son; but matters don’t end there, my vengeance has to be con- 
sidered. She'll not emerge from the Bastille save in a crate.” 

“And, pray, what do you mean by that?” 

“Just what I say. The Marquise does not know that in the 
event her son dies, I, though a distant relative, would be sole heir 
to her fortune; the whore shan’t outlast the month; and after I’ve 
properly fucked her scion tonight, tomorrow morning we'll have 
him breakfast on a cup of chocolate which will remove the single 
obstacle between me ancl a windfall.” 

‘““What an accumulation of crimes!” 

‘Not one too many, my dear, if I am to go favorably prepared 
to that crucial rendezvous with the maleficent molecules.” 

‘Astonishing man! And there’s something substantial to be 
gained from the enterprise, I take it?” 

“Over five hundrec. thousand livres a year, Juliette, and earn- 
ing them entails an investment of twenty sous worth of arsenic. 
Well,” said the Minister, getting to his feet, ‘“‘we have some fuck- 
ing ahead of us, let’s not tarry. See for yourself,” he continued, 
giving me his swollen, rock-hard prick to handle, ‘behold the in- 
fluence a criminal thought can have upon my senses. There’s not a 
woman on earth who'd ever have had cause to complain of my 
services if I’d been sure of being able to kill her afterward.” 

Young Rose was expecting us; we lay down in bed on either 
side of him. Saint-Fond covered him with lewd kisses; we frigged 
him, we sucked him, we tongued his vent; and as his imagination 
was powerfully astir, Saint-Fond was soon lodged to the hilt in 
the boy. I titillated my lover’s asshole with my tongue; great 
though his previous exertions had been that day, seldom had I seen 


Juliette & 405 


him loose his sperm in such quantity or seen the spasm last so long. 
He enjoined me to collect his seed from the vessel he had spat it 
into and to convey it to his mouth; this challenge to my libertine 
abilities pleased me hugely, I acquitted myself of the chore with 
gladness in my heart. Next, Rose had to embugger me while the 
Minister bum-fucked him afresh, and then Saint-Fond buggered me 
while licking and sucking the ass of our humble little playfellow, 
whom we wore positively to shreds by dint of the discharging we 
made him do now into our mouths, now into our asses. Dawn was 
approaching when Saint-Fond, dead sick of it all but not yet satis- 
fied, ordered me to hold the child fast, and the villain slashed his 
backside with a hundred or so strokes of a martinet, then beat him 
with his fists and molested him very cruelly indeed. At eleven o’clock 
the chocolate was brought in; upon the Minister’s instructions I 
poisoned the cup in such wise as to ensure his inheritance; and he, 
while I was preparing the poison that would do away with the son, 
busied himself penning a note to the commandant of the Bastille, 
wherein the latter was ordered to administer a similar dose to the 
mother. 

‘And so,” said Saint-Fond, stifling a yawn, “and so,” said he, 
once death had been insinuated by our fell maneuvers into the veins 
of the unlucky child, “that’s what I call a day fairly begun; may the 
Being Supreme in Wickedness but deign to send me four such 
victims a week, and I shall never cease to sing heartfelt praises 
unto his name.” 

Noirceuil and Clairwil, waiting for us, took breakfast to- 
gether; we joined them in due time. Everything of what had passed 
remained a secret between the Minister and me. The two men set 
out for Paris, the doomed child accompanying them; while Clairwil 
and I returned thither in her carriage. 

Concerning this adventure, my friends, I have nothing further 
to tell you that you have not already taken for granted: the crime, 
like all Saint-Fond’s crimes, was crowned with greatest success: he 
very shortly came into possession of a legacy which proved every 
bit as valuable as he had originally estimated; and a million livres, 
representing two years of his new income, was the gift he had the 
kindness to present me for my help in obtaining it. 

On the road to the capital, Clairwil posed me several ques- 


406 ¢ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tions; I managed to elude them. To be sure, I spoke of our lewd 
activities—there would have been no point attempting to conceal 
them, she would not have believed me had I denied them; but as 
for the rest, I hid it all, which was according to Saint-Fond’s 
wishes. During that journey I took the opportunity to remind my 
friend of her promise to secure my admission to her libertine club; 
she gave me her word that I would be received the next time it 
met; we entered the city, kissed, and said goodbye. 


‘Part 


Aree 


NO friends, it is time I tell you a little about myself, and 
above all describe my opulence, fruit of the most deter- 
minedly dissolute living, in order that you will be able to contrast 
it with the state of indigence and adversity wherein my sister, who 
had chosen good behavior, was languishing already. Your outlook 
and philosophy will suggest to you what conclusions are to be drawn 
from these comparisons. 

I lived on a grand scale, on a perfectly enormous scale; you 
must surely have suspected as much, what with the expenses I had 
to make in behalf of my lover. But leaving aside the innumerable 
things required for his pleasure, I had to myself a superb town 
house in Paris, an exquisite property by Sceaux at Barriére-Blanche, 
as delightful a little dwelling as ever you saw, twelve Lesbians were 
perpetually in my train, four equally engaging chambermaids, a 
reader, a night nurse, three carriages, ten horses, four valets 
chosen for their virility and excellence of member, all the other 
appurtenances of a very great household, and after salaries and 
upkeep had been deducted I was left with a balance of two million 
to throw away on trifles of one kind or another. You will concede, I 
believe, that something is to be said for the way I had managed my 
affairs. 

Would you like my daily life described ? 

I rose every day at ten. Until eleven I saw nobody except 
intimate friends; from then until one, my toilette, at which all my 
retinue assisted ; promptly at one o’clock I gave private audience to 
. those individuals who came to solicit my favors, or to the Minister 
when he happened to be in Paris. At two I hied myself to Barriére- 
Blanche where, every day, I would find awaiting me what had been 
delivered by tasteful and conscientious procuresses, to wit: four new 
men, and four new women, with whom I would very wantonly, very 
amply, indulge my caprices. To obtain some idea of the objects I 
used to receive there, you have only to know that not one ef them 


409 


410 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


cost me less than twenty-five /ouis, and I frequently paid double 
that; nor is there any imagining what of the delicious and rare was 
purveyed to me in either sex; at these trysts I more than once met 
women and girls of rank and the highest station; sweet were the 
joys, yes, elaborate were the pleasures I tasted in that house. I 
would return to town at four in the afternoon, and always dine 
with friends. I shall not speak of my board: nowhere in Paris was 
there anything to match it for splender, for delicacy, for profusion; 
and yet I was a hard mistress to my cooks and wine steward, de- 
manding that they ever cutdo themselves; but I need not press the 
point, you are familiar enough with my extreme intemperance. It is 
perhaps a mild vice, gourmandise; it is one of my favorites none- 
theless; for I have always been of the opinion that unless you carry 
this one to excess you can never properly enjoy the others. After 
those royal repasts I used to go out to the theater; or entertain the 
Minister if it was one of his evenings. 

Regarding my wardrobe, my gems, my furniture, and my 
savings, though at this period I had been scarcely two years with 
Monsieur de Saint-Fond, I believe four million would be a low 
figure for the value of the lot; I had half that sum in gold, and 
used sometimes, after Clairwil’s example, to fling up the lids of my 
treasure chests and masturbate frenziedly: J love crime, and see! 
I would gloat, discharging over the thought, see, here at my disposal 
are all the means I need for committing it. Oh, my good friends, 
*tis a very sweet idea ancl what seas of fuck have I not spilled enter- 
taining it. Did I desire « new piece of jewelry, another dress, any- 
thing, and my lover—w.o disliked having me wear the same thing 
more than twice—would satisfy me immediately ; and in return for 
all that nothing was recuired of me save lawless conduct, lechery, 
libertinage, and prodigious care in arranging the Minister’s frolics. 
It was thus that by flattering my tastes I found them gratified, 
every one; through my surrender to every sensual irregularity my 
senses were kept in a constant drunken exhilaration. 

But such comforts, such joys—what was my moral situation 
as a result of them? Ah, of this I am reluctant to speak, and yet 
however I must. The terrific libertinage I practiced day in and day 
out had so rusted and clecayed the workings of my soul, to such a 
degree had I been envenomed by the pernicious advice, the vicious 


Juliette & 411 


examples I was fairly deluged with from all sides and all the time, 
that I declare to you, I do not think I’d have given a penny out 
of my hoard to rescue someone on the brink of starvation. Indeed, 
about this time a dreadful famine broke out in the vicinity of my 
country home; all the folk in those parts were reduced to the very 
worst distress: I recall hideous scenes, girls sold their bodies by 
the roadside, waifs were abandoned, there were several suicides; 
droves of people came begging to my door; I held firm and de- 
liberately and impudently reasserted my uncharitable disposition by 
laying out fabulous sums for the improvement of my lawns and 
shrubberies. But how can one possibly bestow alms, was my insolent 
rejoinder, when one is in the midst of having mirrored boudoirs 
built in one’s park, and one’s paths beautified by sculptured Cupids, 
Aphrodites, and Sapphos? Everything that could move a heart of 
stone was exhibited to my tranquil gaze; it got them nowhere, 
steadfast I remained: weeping mothers, naked infants, ghostlike 
figures wasted by hunger, I simply smiled, shook my head, and 
throughout those trying months slept as soundly as ever before 
and ate with an increased appetite. Taking stock of my sensations, 
I discovered that what I was feeling bore out my teachers’ pre- 
dictions perfectly : instead of a disagreeable sentiment of pity, there 
was kindled in me a certain restlessness, a commotion produced by 
the evil I fancied I was doing in turning those wretches away empty- 
handed, and within my nerves there was a certain rush of heat much 
like the blaze ignited in us whenever we violate a law or subdue 
a prejudice. I suddenly recognized how delightful putting these 
principles into practice could be; and I understood that if the 
spectacle of misery caused by unkind fate can be sublimely volup- 
tuous for those with minds trained and enriched by such doctrines 
as had been inculcated in mine, then the spectacle of misery for 
which one has oneself been responsible must surely intensify this 
pleasure; as you know, mine is a fertile imagination, it now began 
to run riot. The logic of the thing was eminently simple: I reaped 
pleasure merely from denying to the destitute the wherewithal that 
would have brought them respite; ah, what might I not experience 
from being the direct and sole cause of that destitution? If, said I, 
it is sweet to refuse to do good, it must be heavenly to do evil. 
I summoned up this idea, played with it during those critical 


412 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


moments when the flesh catches fire from the sparks emitted by 
an excited brain; moments when one is particularly apt to heed the 
voice of desires become that much more strident, that much more 
imperious with the receding into unimportance, and finally into 
nullity, of all else. The dream once dreamt and over, one may 
subside again into prudence and sobriety—it requires little or no 
effort. Purely intellectual wrongs are always easily effaced. They 
harm no one; but, unfortunately, the thing is likely to go farther. 
Ah, one says to oneself, what shall the deed itself do to me if the 
mere grating of the thought upon my nerves has been able to affect 
them so keenly? The “emptation is enormous: one makes the 
accursed dream come true, and its existence is a crime. 

Less than a mile from my chateau stood a humble cottage 
belonging to a peasant, one Martin Des Granges; in this world he 
had little else beyond his eight children and a wife who for kind- 
liness and cheerfulness und thrift was a veritable treasure to the 
man; would you believe it? this asylum of poverty and virtue excited 
my fury and wickedness. Very true it is, to this I bear witness, that 
crime is a delectable thing; very certain it is that the flame it darts 
through our whole being is what sets alight the torch of lust, that 
it requires but the thought of crime to hurl us into a lubricious 
ferment. 

I had taken Elvire with me the day I visited that place, and 
with ‘me also I had some phosphorus in a jar; upon arriving, I 
instructed that witty little jade to go in to entertain the family, 
saying I would join her in a minute; whereupon I slipped off and 
buried the combustible amidst the hay in the loft above the room 
where the wretches slept. I climb back down, enter, the youngsters 
kiss me, we play games together, the mother and I chat about the 
details of her householc!. The father asks if he may offer me some 
refreshment? He endeavors to be as hospitable as his dreadfully 
scanty means permit... . I am not for all that swerved an inch 
from my purpose, not in the least melted; what are my emotions? 
I inspect them and find it is not a tedious pity that pervades me, 
but a delicious irritation which racks me to the core of my being: 
a mere touch and I could discharge ten times over. I distribute 
renewed caresses to every member of this wonderful family into 
whose midst I have just sown the seeds of murder; my fell deceit

is at its height; the blacker grows my gratuitous treachery, the 
more violent the itch in my cunt. To the mother I give some ribbons, 
candy to the brats; we take our leave, start for home; but I am in 
such a state of excitement, of very delirium, that I feel my knees 
ready to buckle and must beg Elvire to come to my relief. We 
turn off the road into a thicket, I raise my skirts, I spread my 
legs . . . she puts her hand to my sex, has scarce inserted her 
fingers when I discharge; never before had I known anything like 
those terrible moments. ‘“‘What ails you, Madame?” asked Elvire, 
unaware of what I had just done. 

“Don’t speak to me, frig me... frig me,” said I, thrusting 
my tongue into her mouth, “I am fearfully overwrought this 
morning, that’s all. Here, let me have your cunt, let me toy with it, 
and let’s both of us drown in rivers of fuck.” 

“But what can have happened ?” 

“Horrors, my dove . . . atrocities, and sperm flows mar- 
velously, believe: me, when its spurts are started out of the womb 
of abomination. So frig me, Elvire, frig me, dear heart, I have 
got to discharge.” 

And the‘creature kneels, glides her head between my thighs, 
her tongue glides into my cunt, thrills there. “Oh fuck!” I gasp, 
“tis even so, ’tis so, you seize me well... .” 

And my seed washes her lips, her nose, drips down her chin. 
... We pursue our way. 

I reached home in an indescribable exaltation, it was as though 
every violent impulse, every instinct, every vice were allied in an 
effort to debauch my very soul, I swam in a kind of intoxication... 
in a kind of rage, there was nothing I might not’ have done, no 
lewd act I could not have soiled myself with. Bitterly I regretted 
that my blow had fallen upon only a tiny fraction of humanity, great 
was the evil in me, great enough to have laid all Nature waste; 
I dashed into one of my boudoirs and, naked, flung myself upon a 
couch, I commanded Elvire to send'me in every man she could get 
hold of, I bade them do everything they wished with me provided 
they insulted me, reviled me, treated me like the vilest whore. I was 
fingered, pawed, prodded, spat upon, beaten, slapped; my cunt, 
my ass, my breasts, my mouth were all used, befouled; would that 
I had had twenty other altars to present for their offerings. Some 


’

of those men left and fetched back their friends, individuals I had 
never seen before, I opened my holes to them, refused no one, 
was the harlot to everyone, anyone, and fuck gushed in torrents 
out of me. One of the more uncouth of those studs—I had been 
baiting him—declared it was not upon a bed he wanted to fuck me, 
but in the mire; I let him drag me bodily into a pigsty and there, 
in slime and excrement, I flung my legs apart and challenged him 
to do his worst. The knzve performed brutally and let me go only 
after having shat all over my face ... and I was happy. The more, 
the deeper I wallowed in ordure and infamy, the greater grew my 
excitement, the fiercer my joy. In less than two hours I was tupped 
twenty times over, and J<lvire never stopped frigging me through- 
out it all, and nothing, no, nothing alleviated my pangs, my suffer- 
ings hideous and delicious and provoked by the thought constantly 
in my mind, that of the crime I had just perpetrated. Going upstairs 
to my dressing room, we noticed a ruddy glow in the distance. 

‘‘Madame, come look!” Elvire called, opening a window. 
“Look, Madame, a fire—over there, do you see? In that direction, 
where we were this morning—” 

And I tottered bac«, to fall nearly unconscious upon the sofa. 
We were alone, that pretty girl and I. For perhaps five minutes, 
or ten, she frigged me; and then I sat up, thrusting Elvire away. 

‘(Do you not hear shouts?” I demanded. “Come, let’s not 


tarry here, a rare spec:acle awaits us outside. . . . Elvire, I am 
responsible for this—” 
‘*Madame ?” 


“Come, I say, let's go gloat together over my triumph. I 
simply must see it all, I must savor it all, I don’t want to miss 
a detail.” 

We set out as we were, the two of us—our hair disheveled, 
our dresses rumpled, weariness and delight traced in our features: 
we resembled a pair of bacchantes, Stopping twenty paces away 
from that scene of horror, behind a little hillock which hid us from 
the sight of others, I sink again into the embrace of an Elvire 
almost as aroused as I: we cunt-suck each other by the light of 
homicidal flames my ferocity has ignited, we discharge to the sound 
of shrill screams coming from a woe and anguish that are my 
confection; and never has woman been happier than was I. 


Juliette & 415 


At last we regain our feet and stand awhile surveying that 
panorama of destruction, then move closer to pore over the details. 
Great is my distress at concluding, as I count the corpses, that two 
members of the family must have escaped me. I examine the 
charred bodies one by one, recognize each: these people were 
alive this morning, I muse, and now, but a few hours later, here 
they are, dead; killed by me. And why did I do it? Out of fun. 
To spill my fuck. So this is what murder is! A little organized 
matter disorganized; a few compositional changes, the combination 
of some molecules disturbed and broken, those molecules tossed 
back into the crucible of Nature who, re-employing the selfsame 
materials, will cast them into something else so that in but a 
day or so they shall reappear in the world again, only guised a 
little differently; this they call murder—truly now, in all serious- 
ness, I ask myself, where is the wrong in murder? This woman 
here, that infant there—in the eyes of Nature does either count 
for more than, say, a housefly or a maggot? I deprive the one of 
life, so doing I give life to the other—how can this be made out 
an offense to Nature? ; 

This little revolt of the intellect against the heart set the 
electrical globules in my nerves briskly into motion, and once again 
my companion found her fingers wetted by my running cunt. 
I honestly do not know to what lengths I might not have gone had 
I been alone. Who can tell, possessed of a perfectly Caribbean 
cruelty, I’d perhaps have fallen to devouring my victims : there they 
lay, strewn invitingly upon the ground: none but the father and one 
of the children had got away, the mother and the seven others had 
perished; and as I stared down at them, felt, palpated them, I 
repeated to myself: I have done this, I. These murders were 
planned by me, consummated by me, they are my handiwork, my 
creation .. . and I discharged afresh. 

Of the cottage not a stick remained; it was hard to imagine 
a dwelling had ever stood there, that human beings had ever 
inhabited this wilderness. 

And now, my friends, what do you fancy was Clairwil’s re- 
action when she heard of my feat! She listened to the recital in 
cold silence, one eyebrow raised; and when I was done, she assured 


416 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


me that I had precious little to boast of; indeed said she, I had 
acquitted myself more like a coward than a criminal. 

“In the execution of your undertaking I notice several grave 
defects,” she declared, and her comments are worth citing, for 
they reveal the character of that unusual woman; “firstly,” she 
specified, “you proceeded in slipshod style: had someone chanced 
to come along, your gestures, your exuberance,, very telltale, would 
have constituted evidence against you. Beware of such loose con- 
duct. Ardor, passion—by all means, but keep it inward; outwardly, 
nonchalance, phlegm. Circumscribe, contain the lubricious effects, 
under pressure their temperature mounts. 

“Secondly, scope and grandeur are sadly lacking in your con- 
ception of the thing, which. I am obliged to qualify as mean; for 
you must admit that with a large town and seven or eight sizable 
villages plainly visible from your windows, there is a timorousness, 
undue modesty in exerting yourself upon a single house, an isolated 
house in a secluded place furthermore . . . from fear, one is led 
to suppose, lest the flares, by spreading, extend the dimensions of 
your petty felony: your nervousness, your anxiety, in committing 
it are only too apparent. You spoiled your pleasure, for crime’s 
pleasures brook no restriction; I speak from experience: there 
where free rein is not given the imagination, where the hand is 
stayed by some scruple or consideration, the ecstasy cannot possibly 
be complete, for there always subsists a regret: J could have done 
more, and I did not. And regrets arising from virtue sting worse 
than those consecutive to crime: should he who follows in virtue’s 
train happen to perforra a piece of wickedness, he is always able to 
comfort himself by the thought that a host of good deeds will wipe 
the blot away, and as it is easy to convince oneself of anything 
one desires to believe, his conscience is soon at peace. But for those 
who travel the path of vice matters are not so simple, a missed 
opportunity is something we cannot forgive ourselves because it 
cannot be compensated by anything; no virtue comes to our rescue; 
and the promise we make to do something worse only whets our 
palate for evil, without consoling us for having let a chance of 
doing it go by. 

‘Another observation has to be made,” Clairwil went on. 
“To even the most superficial glance your scheme betrays a very 


Juliette & 417 


glaring error; had I been in your place I would surely have brought 
an action against that Des Granges. Nothing simpler than to have 
had him charged with arson and burned at the stake; oh, yes indeed, 
I would have included that item on the program. For are you 
unaware that when fire breaks out in the house of a tenant—and 
Des Granges is one of your tenants—you have the right to sum- 
mon the authorities and launch an inquiry to determine whether 
the tenant is the culprit? Who knows, perhaps the fellow wished 
to get rid of his wife and children and then go off and play the 
shiftless beggar somewhere else? The moment he bolted from 
the house you should have had him arrested while attempting flight, 
don’t you see; you spend a few louis collecting witnesses; to begin 
with, Elvire, she was there: she affirms that the very same morning 
she saw the guilty one skulking distractedly about in the barnyard, 
climbing up to the hayloft, she spoke to him, questioned him, got 
only gibberish for answer; and the courts would have done the 
rest: inside a week you'd have been treated to the voluptuous 
spectacle of your man being burned alive at your gate. Let this 
be a lesson to you, Juliette, profit from it, as soon as the idea for 
a crime occurs to-you, concert its amplification, its aggravation; 
and while putting it into execution, further elaborate upon your 
idea.” 

There, my friends, those, textually, are the cruel additions 
Clairwil would have had me join to my miscreancy; and why deny 
it? deeply stirred by her arguments, forced to recognize that I had 
performed shabbily, I promised myself that in the future my 
enterprises would defy criticism. I was aggrieved above all by the 
peasant’s escape; what would I not have given to see him roasted 
on my doorstep! The mere recollection of that loss pains me to 
this day. 


At last came the time appointed for my reception into 
Clairwil’s club. Its name was the Sodality of the Friends of Crime. 
On the morning of that day my sponsor brought for my study 
a copy of the Sodality’s bylaws; here, let me read them to you, I 
believe you will find them intriguing. 


418 ¢ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


STATUTES OF THE SODALITY OF THE FRIENDS OF CRIME 


Deferring to the common usage, the Sodality admits the serv- 
iceability of the word crime; but makes plain declaration that in its 
employment thereof with reference to any kind of act of whatever 
sort or color, no condemnatory or pejorative sense is ever intended. 
Thoroughly convinced that man is not free, and that, bound abso- 
lutely by the laws of Nature, all men are slaves of these funda- 
mental laws, the Sodality therefore approves and legitimates every- 
thing, and considers as i:s most zealous and most estimable Mem- 
bers those who, unhesitatingly and unrepentantly, acquit themselves 
of the greatest number of those vigorous actions fools in their 
weakness call crimes; because it is the Sodality’s belief that 
through accomplishing these actions the individual serves Nature, 
that their performance is dictated by her, and that if such a thing 
as crime there be, it is characterized by the reluctance or refusal 
to do any of the very various things Nature may inspire and hence 
enjoin. The Sodality therefore stands protectively behind all its 
Members, guaranteeing all of them aid, shelter, refuge, allies, 
funds, counsel, everything needed to counter the maneuvers of the 
law; all Members who violate it are safeguarded and championed 
automatically by the Sodality, which considers itself above the law 
because the law is of mortal and artificial contrivance, whereas the 
Sodality, natural in its origin and obediences, heeds and respects 
Nature only. 

1. No distinction is drawn among the individuals who com- 
prise the Sodality; not that it holds all men equal in the eyes of 
Nature—a vulgar notion deriving from infirmity, want of logic, 
and false philosophy—but because it is persuaded and maintains 
that distinctions of any kind may have a detrimental influence upon 
the Sodality’s pleasures and are certain sooner or later to spoil 
them.? 

2. The individual presenting himself for membership in the 

1The proponents of that absurd doctrine of equality will always be recruited 
from. the ranks of the weak; it is never espoused save by him who, unable to rise 
to the class of the strong, can at least find comfort in pulling that class down to his 
own level; but of all theories this one is the most derisory, the most unnatural; and 


it is nowhere current except with the viler underbred sort who, moreover, and of 
this you may rest assured, will abandon it once they’ve got a little gilt on their rags. 


Juliette & 419 


Sodality must forswear whatever religious faith he may happen to 
be encumbered with; his contempt for these crack-brained beliefs 
and for the fictitious object of worship they revolve around will be 
judged by means of tests to which he ought to expect to be put; 
the penalty of immediate expulsion is prescribed for those who, 
however mildly, and even in the spirit of jest, backslide into these 
abject practices. 

3. God, in the view of the Sodality, does not exist; sound 
evidence of atheism is a prerequisite for entry into it; the sole 
divinity it recognizes is pleasure; to pleasure it sacrifices everything ; 
it considers voluptuous activities, all imaginable voluptuous ac- 
tivities, and nothing but voluptuous activities, sacred; whatever 
delectates, it considers good; within the Sodality all forms of 
pleasure-seeking and of pleasure-taking are authorized, it frowns 
on none, there is not one it does not applaud, encourage, and 
promote. 

4. The Sodality dissolves all marital ties and ignores those 
of blood; under its roof one should disport indiscriminately with 
the wife of one’s neighbor as with one’s own, should for enjoyment 
consult one’s own brother, sister, children, nephews, quite as one 
would do with the brothers, sisters, children, nephews of somebody 
else; and any unwillingness to comply with these rules constitutes 
strong grounds for expulsion. 

5. A husband is bound to present his wife for admission; a 
father, his son or daughter; a brother, his sister; an uncle, his 
nephew or niece; etc. 

6. Entry into the Sodality is barred to those unable to indi- 
cate a minimum yearly income of twenty-five thousand livres, dues 
of membership being ten thousand francs per annum. This sum is 
the equivalent of average estimated costs per Member, and out of 
it are paid expenses entailed by the upkeep of the Sodality’s seat, 
rentals, maintenance of the seraglios, carriages and equipages, 
offices, and functionaries’ salaries, outlay for the Assemblies, sup- 
pers, and lighting; and when the Treasurer reports a favorable 
balance at year’s end, he divides it among his fellow Members; and 
in that other case where disbursements have exceeded revenue, 
a tax is levied and the deficit made up to the Treasurer, whose 
word in these matters is always accepted without question. 


420 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


7. Twenty artists and literary figures are to be admitted 
upon remittance of the modest fee of a thousand /ivres per annum; 
this special consideration is part of the Sodality’s policy of patraniz- 
ing the arts; it regrets that its means do not permit it to welcome, at 
this insignificant price, a larger number of these gifted persons to 
whom it would give every kind of encouragement. 

8. The Members of the Sodality, united through it into one 
great family, share all their hardships as they do their joys; they 
aid one another mutually in all life’s various situations; but alms, 
charities, help extended to widows, orphans, or persons in distress 
are rigorously forbidden, both within the Sodality and above all 
without; should proof be brought forward, or the simple sus- 
picion arise, that a Member has indulged in such so-called good 
works, he will be expelled. 

9. An emergency fund of thirty thousand /ivres is kept in con- 
stant reserve and is at the disposition of any Member who by 
accident or ill fate finds himself in difficulties of whatever sort. 

10. The President is elected by ballot, and his period of office 
is one month; he may be of either sex; and presides at twelve 
Assemblies, whereof there are three per week. His duties are to see 
that the Sodality’s laws are respected, to supervise the correspond- 
ence executed by a Pernanent Committee whose chairman is the 
President. The Treasurer and the Sodality’s two Executive Secre- 
taries sit on this Committee; but as with the President, each Execu- 
tive Secretary's term of office expires after one month. 

11, Each Assembly is opened by a speech delivered by one of 
the Members; the tenor of his address is always contrary to polite 
custom and religion; if it is deemed worthy thereof, it is printed 
forthwith, at the Sodal ty’s expense, and deposited in its Archives. 

12. During those hours devoted to corporative frolicking, 
all Members, male and female, are naked; they intermingle, i in the 
melee partners are chosen indiscriminately, and there is no such 
thing as a valid refusal whereby one individual would deny his 
pleasure to another. Once called upon, each individual must co- 
operate instantly, unreservedly, gladly; has he not the right to 
demand the same a few minutes later ? Should an individual attempt 
to shirk his obligations toward his brethren, he will be forcefully 


Juliette & 421 


constrained to fulfill them and then be driven ignominiously out of 
the Sodality. 

13. During Assembly, no cruel passion, save whipping inflicted 
upon the buttocks only, may be given vent to; the Sodality pos- 
sesses seraglios, and there dangerous passions may be exercised with 
entire freedom; but when amongst his fellows each Member must 
confine himself to crapulous, incestuous, sodomistic, and benign 
merrymaking. 

14. The completest confidence reigns among Members of the 
Sodality; they may and ought to avow to one another their tastes, 
their foibles, chat intimately, and employ the exchange of confes- 
sions as a further spur to pleasure. Were anyone to disclose 
Sodality secrets, or in one of his fellows to criticize ungener- 
ously the failings or predilections which make for the success of his 
pleasure-seeking, he would be expelled straightway. 

15. Hard by the public pleasure hall are located private cells 
whereunto one may repair solitarily to indulge in all the debau- 
cheries of libertinage; these cells are available to groups of any 
size, they are appropriately and fully equipped, and each contains 
a youth and a young lass with whom, at all times, Sodality Members 
may execute any passion whatsoever, including those allowed only 
inside the seraglios, for these children being of the same species as 
the seraglios are stocked with, and indeed belonging to the seraglios, 
they may be treated similarly. 

16. Eating and drinking carried to any point of gluttony and 
drunkenness are authorized; every Member is assured of assistance 
while indulging in these as in other excesses; all possible measures 
are taken to facilitate them. 

17. No condemnation by a court of law, no public disgrace, 
no defamation of character will disqualify a candidate for admission 
into the Sodality. Its principles being based upon crime, the criminal 
element poses no threat to it; to the contrary. Rejected by the 
world, these outcasts will find consolations and friends in a society 
which recognizes their value and will always give preference to 
their candidacy. The worse a given individual’s reputation abroad, 
the more highly he will be thought of by the Sodality; very notorious 
criminals and eminent public enemies may be elected to the pres- 


422 eh THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


idency upon the day of their admission, and given the run of the 
seraglios without prior novitiate. 

18. Public confession is made at each of the four major Gen- 
eral Assemblies, the dates of which coincide with what Catholics call 
the four great festival days of the year; at them each Member is in 
turn obliged to declare in a loud and clear voice by and large 
everything he has done: if his conduct has been blameless, he is re- 
proved; much praise is his if it has been irregular; be it horrible, if 
he has accumulated execrable deeds, then he is rewarded; but in this 
last case he must produce witnesses. The prizes are fixed at ten 
thousand francs drawn from the Treasury. 

19, Frequented by Members only, their location known to 
Members alone, the Sodz.lity’s premises are of particular splendor ; 
and surrounded by superb grounds. Fires are maintained in all 
rooms throughout the winter season. Assemblies begin at five in 
the afternoon and last until noon the following day. Toward mid- 
night a sumptuous meal is served, refreshments are available at 
all other times. 

20. All games and gambling are forbidden during Assembly ; 
devoted to more natural forms of recreation, the Sodality frowns 
upon anything in any way conducive to the neglect of libertinage’s 
divine passions, the only ones capable of electrifying the human 
being. 

21. One month is the period of initiation for each newly 
elected Member; during this novitiate he is completely at the 
disposition of the Sodality, is its toy; may not enter the seraglios or 
enjoy any privilege or consideration. He must consent to all such 
propositions as are made him; failure so to do may incur capital 
punishment. 

22. Election to all posts is by secret ballot; factions, cabals, 
cliques are strictly forbidden. These posts are those of President, 
the two Executive Secretaries, Censors, the two Wardens entrusted 
with government of the seraglios, Treasurer, Steward, Bailiff, the 
two Physicians, two Surgeons, Obstetrician, Master of the Chan- 
cery under whom are the Scribes, the Printers, the Reviser, and the 
Censor of Texts and Pablications, and the Inspector General of 
admission cards. 

23. Men over forty years of age, women over thirty-five are 


Juliette & 423 


not received by the Sodality; once admitted, however, no Member 
may be expelled on grounds of old age. 

24. Any member who does not attend a Sodality Assembly 
during the space of a year will be stricken from the roster; obliga- 
tions public or private, however, constitute valid excuse for absence. 

25. Any written work attacking polite customs or religion 
presented by a Sodality Member, whether of his production or 
no, will be deposited at once in the Library, and the donor will be 
rewarded therefore, in accordance with the merits of the work and 
his share in its composition. 

26. Children resulting from Sodality unions will be, at birth, 
immediately placed in the créche and subsequently in the nursery 
annexed to the seraglios, later—at the age of ten for boys, of seven 
for girls—to become inmates thereof. But a woman addicted to 
child-bearing will not be tolerated by the Sodality, propagation 
being utterly alien to its spirit and aims; true libertinage abhors 
progeniture; and the Sodality therefore disfavors it: female Mem- 
bers will denounce men given to this mania and if the latter prove 
incorrigible, they also will be invited to prepare their withdrawal 
from the Sodality. 

27. The President’s duties are to ensure the smooth running 
of the Assembly. Under his orders is the Censor; theirs is the re- 
sponsibilty for maintaining decorum and a propitious atmosphere: 
the calm, the freedom from interference, the enthusiasm of agents, 
the submissiveness of patients; they are, as well, to see to the preser- 
vation of quiet, moderating laughter and conversations and every- 
thing else that is incondite and not in the spirit of libertinage or that 
is damaging to it. The President has the highest authority over the 
seraglios. He may not, during his term of office, leave Sodality head- 
quarters unless he appoints his predecessor to take temporary 
charge in his absence. 

28. Oaths, hard language, and blasphemies in particular are 
authorized, they may be employed upon all occasions. Between 
Members the familiar thou is compulsory. 

29. The jealousies, the quarrels, the scenes entailed in love, 
as well as the language of love, endearing expressions, tender ones, 
etc., are absolutely prohibited; all this is detrimental to libertinage, 
and libertinage is the business to which the Sodality is to attend. 


424 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


30. Dueling has no place in the Sodality, nor roistering, nei- 
ther do bullies and bravoes, they will be expelled mercilessly. Pol- 
troonery is revered here as it was in Rome. The coward lives at 
peace with his fellows; he is quite commonly a libertine too, such are 
the people the Sodality wants. 

31. The total number of Members may at no time exceed 
four hundred and in so far as that is possible, the proportionate 
strength of the two sexes will be kept equal. 

32. Theft is permitted within the bounds of the Sodality; but 
murder is not, except in the seraglios. 

33. Members need not bring with them the furnitures, imple- 
ments, and weaponry requisite to libertinage; for the house pro- 
vides these objects in abundance and variety, and they are clean. 

34. Repulsive deformities or diseases will not be put up with. 
Someone so afflicted, were he to present himself, would most surely 
be rejected. And were an already admitted Member to fall prey 
to such misfortunes, he would be asked to resign. 

35. A Member who contracts the venereal malady will be ob- 
liged to retire until completely restored, his recovery being vouched 
for by the house Physician and Surgeons. 

36. No foreigner will be admitted; provincials are likewise 
debarred. The Sodality exists only for persons resident in Paris and 
its environs. 

37. High birth will in no wise facilitate admission; the es- 
sential is to prove one has the necessary means alluded to above 
(Article 6). However pretty a woman may be she shall not be 
accepted unless she possess the required wealth; the same will apply 
to any young man, however handsome. 

38. Neither beauty nor youth confers any exclusive privilege 
in the Sodality; privileges would speedily destroy the equality 
which must prevail there. 

39. Death will be the certain fate of any Member who di- 
vulges secrets of the Scdality, which will have him hunted down 
no matter where he goes. and at no matter what cost. 

40. Ease, liberty, impiety, crapulousness, all libertine excesses, 
all those of debauchery, of eating and drinking, in short, of what is 
known as foul lust, will reign supreme during Assembly. 

41. One hundred male servants are retained at all times and 


Juliette & 425 


paid by the Sodality; they, youthful and attractive all, may be used 
to fill passive roles in lewd scenes; but will never participate actively 
therein. The Sodality owns sixteen vehicles, a corresponding num- 
ber of teams, has two equerries in its hire and fifty outside valets. 
It has a print shop, type setters, a dozen copyists, and four readers; 
and in addition all the personnel necessitated by the seraglios. 

42. No firearms, no sword, no stick may be introduced into 
the hall reserved for pleasure. Before entering, Members leave 
all they have with them in a spacious cloakroom, where trust- 
worthy women relieve them of their clothing and are held account- 
able for it. Adjoining the hall are several public conveniences; 
stationed in each are attendants, girls and boys, ready to be of any 
service; they have syringes, bidets, vessels in the English style, 
ordinary pots, high-quality linens, cloths and swabs, perfumes, 
and in general everything needed before and after the operation 
or while it is in course. They will lend their tongues upon simple 
request. 

43. Under no circumstances does the Sodality intrude or in- 
terfere in government affairs, nor may any Member. Political 
speeches are expressly forbidden. The Sodality respects the regime 
in power; and if its attitude toward the law is disdainful, that 
is because it holds as a principle that man is incapable of making 
laws which obstruct or contradict those of Nature; but the dis- 
orders of its Members, transpiring privately, ought never to scan- 
dalize either the governed or their governors. 

44. Among the facilities offered Sodality Members are two 
seraglios, they are located in the two wings of the main building. 
One is composed of three hundred boys ranging from seven to 
twenty-five years of age; the other of a like number of girls, from 
five to twenty-one. These creatures are constantly replaced, not 
a week goes by but at least thirty are winnowed out of each seraglio 
so as to make room for fresh accessions: close by is an establish- 
ment where new lots are trained up to fill gaps in the ranks. Sixty 
procuresses look after recruitment; and, as has been said, there is 
a Warden for each seraglio. These seraglios are agreeable places, 
comfortably appointed; there, one does exactly what one likes; 
the most ferocious passions are exercised in these sanctuaries where 
all Sodality Members are admitted free of charge; however, a tax 


426 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of one hundred crowns is levied per creature murdered. Those 
Members who choose to sup in a seraglio are at liberty to do so; 
entrance tickets are distributed by the President, who cannot refuse 
them to Members in good standing and who have accomplished 
their month as novices. The extremest subordination on the part 
of the inmates prevails in the seraglios; complaints relative to lack 
of submissiveness or of cooperation will be taken at once to the 
Warden of the seraglio, or to the President, and no time is lost 
chastising the miscrean:, according to the plaintiff’s specifications, 
and you have the right *o inflict the penalty yourself, if such things 
amuse you. There are twelve torture chambers per seraglio, where 
everything is at hand for dealing with victims in the most awful, the 
most unspeakable manner. Although each seraglio contains crea- 
tures of only one sex, they may be mixed at will and to taste, males 
being fetched into the rnidst of females, or females into the midst 
of males. There are in addition twelve dungeons per seraglio, for 
the use of those who enjoy subjecting victims to the slow death of 
incarceration. Inmates of the two seraglios may not be removed 
either to the pleasure halls or to a Member’s personal residence. 
The lateral pavilions housing the seraglios contain. menageries as 
well, where animals of every species await the Member given to 
bestiality; this is a simple passion and altogether natural, and must 
hence be respected like all the rest. 

Three complaints brought against any one subject suffice to 
have him removed. Three requests that he be put to death suffice to 
have him dispatched without further ado. In each seraglio are four 
executioners, four jaile-s, eight whippers, four flayers, four mid- 
wives, and four surgeons all at the orders of Members who, in the 
heat of passion, might have need of the ministry of such personages; 
it being understood of course that the midwives and surgeons are 
present not by any means to render humanitarian aid, but to assist 
in tortures. As soon as a seraglio inmate manifests the slightest 
symptom of illness he is sent to the hospital, never again to return 
to the house. 

Each seraglio is surrounded on three sides by high walls. All 
the windows are barrecl, and the inmates remain indoors, always. 
Between the building and the high wall shielding it is a space ten 
feet wide, forming an alley bordered by cypress trees; Sodality 


Juliette 2 427 


Members sometimes take seraglio inmates for walks along this 
secluded pathway, to indulge with them in pleasures more somber 
and often still more frightful. At the foot of a number of these 
trees are holes, pits into which a victim may be made to disappear; 
suppers are held under these trees from time to time, and occasion- 
ally in these very pits: whereof some are extremely deep, descent 
into them being possible by means only of hidden stairways, and in 
the lower reaches of which one may accomplish every imaginable 
infamy, the same stillness, the same silence reigning there as in the 
uttermost bowels of the earth. 

45. No candidate will be admitted without first signing both 
the oath he will be made to repeat, and the list of obligations cor- 
responding to his sex. 


The time came to leave. I was adorned like the goddess of 
daylight; Clairwil, my sponsor, was in a gay mood and out of 
coquetry had dressed herself to look like a girl of fourteen. En 
route she reminded me of the extreme docility I was to show in the 
face of all the Sodality members’ desires, and she also said that as 
regards the seraglios I would simply have to be patient for, as a 
novice, it would be a month before I could make use of them, no 
exception was ever allowed to the rules. 

The house to which we were driving was in one of the bleakest 
and least populous quarters of Paris; it took nearly an hour to get 
there. My heart beat excitedly when our carriage entered a dark 
courtyard virtually enclosed by tall black trees, the gates shut im- 
mediately after we were inside. A servant was awaiting us as we 
stepped from the carriage, and he escorted us into the hall. Clairwil 
was obliged to surrender her clothing: I, however, was to undress 
later, in the course of the ceremony. This was a veritable palace, su- 
perbly lit; in the entrance and so placed on the floor that one could 
not avoid treading upon it was a big crucifix sprinkled with hosts 
and at whose farther end was the Bible, which one had to step 
upon as well; I was not daunted, you may be sure, by any of these 
obstacles. 

I went in. An exceedingly handsome woman of thirty-five was 
presiding, she was nude, her coiffure was magnificent; those to her 


428 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


left and right where she sat on the platform of honor were naked 
also, they were two men and a woman. Over three hundred mem- 
bers had already arrived and there they were, all naked; some 
were encunting, some masturbating, some flagellating, some cunt- 
sucking, some sodomizing, some discharging, and all that most 
serenely and amidst perfect calm: not a sound was to be heard 
save the noises necessitated by the various circumstances. Some 
were strolling about in pairs, some alone; many were watching the 
crowd and while gazing at spectacles fingering themselves volup- 
tuously. There were several groups, some of them composed of up 
to eight and even ten persons; many of men only; no fewer of 
women exclusively; of several women between two men; and of 
several men occupying two or three women. Extremely pleasant in- 
cense burned in great cassolettes, emitting heady vapors whose 
irresistible effect was a sort of sensual languor. I saw a trio emerge 
together from one of the latrines. 

And then the President rose and in a quiet voice said that she 
would like to have the attention of the assembly for a moment. 
Activity soon ceased and a few minutes later I found myself 
surrounded by all the members present; never had I been so closely 
scrutinized nor by so ma:ty people; each delivered an opinion, and I 
believe I can assert that the view generally expressed was flattering; 
there was whispering, glances, nods were exchanged, and clearly 
all sorts of little plots were being hatched against me, and I 
shuddered at the thought that I was about to have to subject my- 
self to all the desires roused by my youth and my charms. At length 
the President bade me step up and stand on the dais opposite her; 
and there, a balustrade separating me from the very numerous com- 
pany, I was upon her instructions divested of my raiments by two 
servants who in less tire than it takes to tell had off every stitch 
I was wearing. When the servants withdrew and left me absolutely 
naked before the bold stares of those several hundred spectators, I 
was, I do admit, somewhat embarrassed; but that feeling was 
short-lived, my impudence was restored at once by the applause 
I heard ring out. These, such as I shall recite them to you, were the 
questions the President put me; and my answers to them: 

“Do you promise to live your whole life long in libertinage of 
the very extremest order?” 


Juliette & 429 


“T swear it.” 

“Do you esteem all lewd acts, whatever they be and including 
the most odious, to be simple and natural ?” 

“They are all as one to me, thus do I consider them.” 

“Would you commit each and every one of them if moved by 
the slightest desire ?” 

“T would indeed. All of them.” 

“Do you declare your intention to adhere strictly to the 
Sodality’s statutes as they have been read out to you by your 
sponsor ?” 

“ey do.” 

“And are you prepared to accept the penalties prescribed 
therein should you prove refractory ?” 

“T am.” 

“Swear it.” 

“T swear.” 

“Are you married ?” 

“No.” 

“Are you a maid ?” 

“No.” 

“Have you been embuggered ?” 

“Often.” 

“Fucked mouthwise ?” 

“Often.” 

“Whipped?” 

“Upon occasion.” 

“What is your name?” 

“‘Juliette.”’ 

“Your age?” 

“T am eighteen.” 

“Have you been frigged by women ?”” 

‘Many times.” 

“Have you committed crimes ?” 

“A few.” 

“Stolen?” 

“Yes.” 

‘Attempted the life of a human being ?” 

“Aye, I have.” 


430 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘Do you promise never to swerve from the path you have fol- 
lowed until now ?” 

“T do swear it.” 

Here a new burst of applause. 

“Will you bring into the Sodality all those related to you by 
bonds of kinship ?” 

“T shall.” 

“Do you agree never to reveal the secrets of the Sodality ?” 

“T shall never reveal them, I swear it.” 

“Do you promise to exhibit the completest indulgence toward 
all the caprices and all the lewd whims of all Sodality members?” 

‘T promise it.” 

‘Whom do you prefer, men or women?” 

‘Where friggery is concerned, I am very fond of women; 
where fucking, I have a passion for men.” 

My naiveté brought forth a wave of laughter from the cor- 
poration. 

‘What think you of the lash?” 

“T like to use it and to have it used upon me.” 

“Of the two pleasures a woman can procure, which do you 
prefer, cunt-fucking or sodomy ?” 

“It has befallen me to disappoint the man who encunted me, 
but never him by whom I was bum-fucked.” 

This reply was much appreciated also. 

‘And your attitude toward oral pleasures ?” 

“T adore them.” 

“Do you like to have your cunt licked ?” 

“Infinitely.” 

‘And do you lick well the cunts of others ?” 

‘With industry and enjoyment and, I have been told, with art.” 

“It may then be presumed that you enjoy sucking pricks?” 

“Draining them.” 

“You swallow ?” 

“I gorge myself.” 

“Have you had offspring ?” 

‘No, none.” 

“Do you intend to refrain from having them ?” 


Juliette & 431 


“I shall do everything in my power to avoid them,” 

“You therefore dislike progeniture ?”’ 

“T detest it.” 

“‘Were you perchance to become pregnant, would you have the 
courage to abort?” 

“Certainly.” 

“Has your sponsor with her the sum constituting your entrance 
fee?” 

“Yes,” 

“Are you wealthy ?” 

“Exceedingly.” 

“And have you ever devoted any of your money to charity ?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Nor have you ever performed a religious gesture since child- 
hood?” 

“Not to my knowledge.” 

Clairwil handed the fee over to the Executive Secretary from 
whom in return she received a small brochure; I was instructed to 
read it aloud. This printed document was headed by the title 
Instructions to Women Admitted into the Sodality of the Friends of 
Crime. 

From a drawer Madame de Lorsange took an envelope, 
opened it. “I have kept the paper,” said she, ‘‘for it is interesting. 
Listen to its contents :’”” 


The estate or condition into which was born she who is to sign 
this matters not in the least, she is a woman, and as such created 
for the pleasures of man. It were hence seeming to prescribe to her 
a mode of comportment which would enable her to make the render- 
ing of her services advantageous to her purse and agreeable to her 


fleshly needs. We shall suppose her married. For those who, though

unmarried, live nevertheless with a man, whether as his mistress or 
as his whore, are bound by the very same chains as those who exist 
in wedlock’s irons, and they will be able to employ the following 
recommendations to similar purpose, that is, the escaping from those 
chains or the lightening of them; wherefore note will be taken that 
the word man as used here generically means lover, husband, or 
keeper, or in fine any individual arrogating to himself rights to a 
woman whatever her sort, because, be she in possession of millions, 
yet she must still earn money from her body, the first law for all 
women being never to fuck save through libertinage or for the sake 
of gain; and as she is cften obliged to pay those who please her, 
she must accumulate the necessary reserves therefor, by means of 
her prostitutions to those others who do not please her; it being 
fully understood that all that follows concerns her behavior in 
society only, the Statutes she having just sworn to observe and up- 
hold fixing her behavior within the confines of the Sodality. 

1. To attain to the apathy that must be preserved, she will, 
regardless of whether i: be for money she fucks or for pleasure, 
take constant care to keep her heart inaccessible to love; for if 
she fucks for pleasure, she’ll obtain little if in love, love being the 
veritable and certain kiss of death to enjoyment: her inevitable 
concern to give pleasure to her lover will prevent her from tasting 
any herself; and if she fucks for money, if in love she will never 
dare squeeze it from her beloved; which, however, ought to be 
her unique object and occupation with the man who pays her. 

2. Eschewing all metaphysical sentiments, she will always 
therefore accord preference to him who, if it be for pleasure she 
fucks, erects quickest and most sizably, has the prettiest prick, or 
the hardest; and if it be for gain she fucks, to him who fees her most 
amply. 

3. She must scrupulously and at all times avoid such person- 
ages as are called fops, idle fellows, dancing masters, and the 
like, that dronish breed pays as poorly as it fucks; let her resort 
rather to valets, stableboys, porters, drudges, butchers, such are 
the breeches energy inhabits, such souls keep secrets safe; menials 
are plentiful, moreover, they can be changed like skirts, and with 
never a moment’s fear of an indiscretion. 


Juliette & 433 


4. Whatever be the man into whose clutches she falls, let her 
take care not to consider his proprietorship exclusive; fidelity, an 
infantile habit and romantic sentiment, can bring about nothing but 
the downfall of a woman, can be nothing but the cause of woes 
without end, and never the source of a single pleasure; and indeed, 
why should she be faithful, since, and she may be very sure of it, 
in all the world there is no such thing as a faithful man? It is ri- 
diculous, is it not, that the more fragile, the weaker sex, the one 
forever open to every enticement into every pleasure, the one whose 
surrender thereto is authorized by daily and manifold seductions— 
absurd, is it not, that it should be this sex that resists temptation 
while the other has as means for evil-doing nothing but his unaided 
solitary wickedness! And more, what’s the use to a woman of her 
fidelity ? If her man loves her truly, he must be of sufficient delicacy 
to tolerate all her failings, and even to share vicariously in the de- 
lights she procures herself and to rejoice therein; if he loves her 
not, a silly creature she, who would be bound utterly to someone 
who deceives her day in and day out; woman’s infidelities, faults if 
you wish, are natural, those of a man proceed from his duplicity 
and his viciousness; the species of woman we have in mind, that 
is, a healthy and intelligent woman, will hence spurn no occasion 
to be unfaithful, rather she will seek such occasions and exploit 
them as often as possible, and to the full. 

5. Deceit is a characteristic no woman can forego, it has ever 
been the weapon of the weak; always confronted by her superior, 
how shall she withstand oppression unless she have frequent re- 
course to lies and imposture? Therefore, let her fearlessly use these 
arms, Nature furnished them to her in order that she have some 
defense against her enemies; men wish to be dupes, an agreeable 
illusion is easier for them to swallow than a bitter reality; and so 
ought she not disguise her wrongs instead of proclaiming them? 

6. A woman should never appear to have a character of her 
own, she must, artfully, borrow that belonging to this or that person 
whom it is to her greatest interest to flatter at the moment, whether 
it be for the sake of her lust or her greed; seeing to it nevertheless 
that this flexibility does not deprive her of the energy essential for 
plunging into all such sorts of misdemeanors and crimes as are 


434 <> THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleasing to her passions or apt to serve them, examples being 
adultery, incest, infanticide, poisonings, robbery, murder, all those, 
in fine, which may be to her liking and which, behind the mask of 
deceit and the treachery we recommend to her, she may under- 
take without fear, pause, or regret, because Nature placed these 
impulses in woman’s hezrt and only false principles acquired along 
with education prevent her from acting in accordance with them 
every day, as she ought to do. 

7. Far from alarming her, let the most extensive, the most 
sustained, the most crapulous libertinage become the basis of her 
most cherished occupations; if she lends an ear to Nature, she will 
discover that from her she has received very pronounced leanings, 
very violent ones, toward this sort of pleasure, and there being no 
grounds here for fear and fewer yet for restraint, she ought to in- 
dulge herself therein cor.stantly: the more she fucks, the better she 
answers Nature’s expectations of her. Nature is not to be outraged 
save by continence.* 

8. Whatever the a:t of debauchery her man may propose to 
her, let her never balk; readiness and good will are her surest 
means for maintaining a hold over him she wishes to keep. A man 
soon wearies of a woman’s favors; what happens if she lacks the 
ability to revive his interest ? He ceases to care for her, begins next 
to loathe her, and abandons her shortly afterward; but he who re- 
marks a woman devoted to the study of his tastes, to anticipating 
his desires, to kindling ard to satisfying them; ah! that man, finding 
the woman in his possession always new, is much more apt to settle 
down to contenting himself with her; the woman is now in a position 
to deceive him, and dece ving her man is the fondest and the most 
unrelentingly pursued okjective of the individual belonging to the 
sex whose duties we are sxetching here. 

9. Let this charming individual very assiduously avoid an air 
of prudishness and of modesty when she is with her man; few in- 
deed they are who appreciate such posings, and great is the risk of 
promptly alienating those who are repelled by them. Let her 
simulate them in public, if she deems this imposture necessary, 


3 Almost all chaste women die young, or go mad, or become sickly and wither 
early away. Furthermore, they are all ill-natured, testy, forward, and rude; they are 
unbearable in society. 


Juliette 435 


anything in the direction of hypocrisy is to be recommended: it is 
one further means to deceit, and she should neglect none of them. 

10. She cannot be too strongly urged to avoid pregnancies, 
either by making extensive use of those various manners of fucking 
which deflect the seed away from the vessel where conception occurs, 
or by destroying the foetus once she suspects its existence. Pregnancy 
is telltale, spoils the figure, endangers the health, is bad from 
every point of view; let her indulge, preferably, in antiphysical 
pleasure, this delicious form of it assures her simultaneously 
greater enjoyment and greater safety, nearly all women who have 
tried it will have no other; the thought, moreover, of the enorm- 
ously increased pleasure they thus give men ought surely, and here 
we consider their amour-propre alone, to spur them to adopt it 
exclusively. 

11. Let a very hardened heart be her protection against a 
sensibility which is certain to be her undoing; a woman susceptible 
of sympathies must expect nothing but the worst, for weaker, more 
delicate, thinner-skinned than men, she will be rent much more 
cruelly by all that assails this sensibility; whereupon she may bid 
all pleasure farewell. Her complexion moves her to lust; if, owing to 
this excess of sensibility we are seeking to destroy, she enslaves 
herself to one man only, as of that moment she deprives herself of 
all the charms of libertinage, the libertinage which, in view of the 
way Nature has constructed her, alone befits her, can alone render 
her truly happy. 

12. Let her meticulously avoid any practice of religion; these 
infamies which she ought long ago to have spat upon can only, as 
they affright her conscience, recall her to a state of virtue she shall 
not re-enter without being forced to renounce all her habits and all 
her pleasures; those frightful platitudes are not worth the sacrifice 
they demand; and like the dog in the fable, she will as she chases 
after them relinquish the reality for the appearance. Atheistic, 
cruel, impious, libertine, wanton, insatiable, a sodomite, a tribade, 
incestuous, vindictive, bloodthirsty, hypocritical, and false—such 
by and large is the description of the woman who will find her right- 
ful place in the Sodality of the Friends of Crime, such are the vices 
she will have need of if she would find happiness within the 
Sodality. 


436 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


The spirited reading I delivered of these precepts convinced 
the assembly I had taken them quite to heart, and amidst claps and 
hurrahs I stepped down into the press. 

The couples distracted from their proceedings by the rites 
of my admission now fell back to their merrymaking, and I was soon 
under assault; at this point I lost view of Clairwil and was not to 
see her again until supp:r. 

First to hail me was a gentleman of fifty. 

‘By Jesus, I’m blind if you don’t have the look of a whore,” 
he exclaimed, steering me toward a couch, “and you talk like one, 
too. I liked your style, s.ut, it put my prick in the air.” 

So saying the lecher encunts me. He scrapes away for a quarter 
of an hour, the while kissing me fervently; then, claimed by a 
woman who plucks him straight off my belly, he deserts me without 
having discharged. It’s next a lady in her sixties who approaches 
and, thrusting me back upon the couch before I can rise, she frigs 
me and has me frig he: at great length. Three or four men have 
been watching us; one o! them suddenly moves in and embuggers the 
matron, who lets forth a screech of pleasure. Another of the men, 
noticing I had been entering into a sweat beneath the old Lesbian’s 
fingerings, had offered me his prick to suck; and now that the 
woman leaves off toying: with me, the rascal glides from my mouth 
to my cunt; he had the prettiest prick in the world and wielded it 
like a god; a girl steals it away from me and stows it impetuously 
into her slit; my rival rods to me, I answer the summons and she 
sets to cunt-licking me: she got his fuck from the man whom I’d 
hoped to drain, and by and by she got mine too. A pair of youths 
sauntered up and joinirg us formed the most pleasant group, en- 
cunting us both; my companion went off with the lad who had just 
served her, leaving me alone for a moment. Here now was a per- 
sonage I recognized as a bishop for whom I had toiled in the past 
when with Madame Duvergier; he encunts me also, after having 
me piss on his face. The next to come, and this ecclesiastic was also 
a familiar face, popped his member into my mouth and let fly 
therein. A very engaging young thing arrives to have herself 
frigged, I suck her with all my heart; her heaving flanks are caught 
firmly in midflight by a man of about forty, who bum-stuffs her; it 
is not long before the libertine has done the same to me, while

tupping he reviled us most energetically, calling us nuns, cunt- 
suckers, and as he sodomized the one he spanked the behind of the 
other. 


“What are you doing to these two buggeresses?” asked a 


well-made young man who strode up then and socratized him on the 
spot; “take that, villain,” he went on, “it’s not woman-ass that will 
cure what ails you.” 

Once again I was left to myself and was recovering my breath 
when an elderly man presented himself, he had a fistful of withes 
and meant to warm my hind parts therewith and to have me warm 
his prick. 

“You're the one they admitted tonight, are you not?” he 
began. 

“y am.’’ 

‘‘A pity I haven’t come across you until now,” said he, “I have 
been busy in a seraglio. You’ve got a damned pretty ass, bend over, 
let me get into it.” 

And he stormed triumphantly through the gate, I got his fuck. 
A delightful young man appeared and dealt with me in the same 
way, though he lashed me far more stoutly; next, one after the 
other, a procession of ten persons, six of them men of the law and 
four men of God; they all fucked me bumwise. I was quite afire, I 
repaired to a public convenience: as women were using only those 
where men were in attendance, it was a lad who, after settling me 
upon the throne and helping me off again, asked if he could lend me 
his tongue. By way of reply I thrust my ass at his nose, and so 
pleasantly did he clean it that fuck escaped me. Returning to the 
assembly hall I remarked some men waiting about, apparently to 
waylay women emerging from the privies; and indeed one of them 
steps up and asks leave to kiss my ass, I wheel it about, his tongue 
probes a moment, he straightens up, and from his sorrowful ex- 
pression I divine his disappointment at finding the cupboard so 
bare. It is without a word he hastens away from me to join a youth 
just then entering the same privy; and IJ profit from a brief respite 
to survey the scene. Believe me when I say that there, in that 
spacious room, the over-all spectacle was one such as distanced 
anything the most lascivious imagination could possibly conceive 
in the course of threescore years: what a wealth of voluptuous atti- 


438 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tudes! how many curicus doings, what a variety of tastes and 
preferences! 

Oh, great God, I murmured, how wondrous indeed is Nature, 
how splendid, and how delicious are these, all the passions she gives 
us. 

But everywhere my eye roved, it was to be amazed at the same 
extraordinary state of affairs: save for the utterances incidental to 
the action, sometimes shrill exclamations of pleasure, and much 
blasphemy, sometimes loud, there was no other sound, one could 
have heard a pin drop. Over all that was astir the most entire order 
reigned; were some altercations to arise, and it happened very 
rarely, a gesture from the President or the Censor restored peace 
and quiet in a trice; thé most decent activities could not have trans- 
pired amidst greater calm. And thus I was made quickly to realize 
that, of all the things there are in the world, the passions are those 
that command the greatest respect from human beings. 

Men and women in ever growing numbers were beginning to 
remove to the seraglios; tickets were being distributed by the 
President, a smile upor her lips. I was now had at by several 
women ; then by several more; I frigged with no fewer than thirty- 
two of them, a good half of whom were past forty: they sucked me, 
fucked me frontwise anc. behind with dildoes, one had me piss into 
her gullet while I lapped her cunt, another suggested we shit on 
each other’s bubs, she larded mine generously, I was’ unable to 
repay her in kind, unfortunately; while a man labored in his ass- 
hole, a second man gobdbled up the excrement steaming on my 
chest; and after that he shat there in turn, as he did so discharging 
into the mouth of him by whom he had just been sodomized. 

The President devzloped a sudden craving for me; she ap- 
pointed a man to relieve her at her post, and we came to grips: 
kissed each other, tongued each other, sucked and caressed each 
other nigh to death. With the exception of Clairwil, never had I 
seen a woman discharge so abundantly nor so lewdly; her favorite 
stunt was to receive a bun-fucking the while, her cunt crushed upon 
a woman’s face, that woman sucked her and she herself cunt-sucked 
another woman: we went brilliantly through this exercise, and the 
whore resumed her chair. 

Back came the men, in force: among this second wave I found 


Juliette % 439 


few encunters but buggers aplenty, an occasional masturbater, and 
a dozen or so mouth-fuckers; one of the latter had himself pumped 
by a youth while snuffling under my armpits, licking them softly 
ever and anon, which procured me a very pleasant sensation. I was 
given five or six floggings; three or four rectal injections, which I 
flushed into the mouths of those who had administered them; I 
was got to fart, there were bidders for my spittle; I spent thirty 
whole minutes sticking thousands of pins into one squire’s buttocks 
and balls, and thus bestudded did he keep himself for the rest of 
the evening; the mania of another was to run his tongue over a 
woman's body, he was two hours lapping my eyes and mouth and 
ears and nostrils and between my toes, and finally inserted his 
tongue in my asshole, and discharged. Several women insisted upon 
fucking me with great, massive dildoes; one led up a man and had 
me heat his prick by chafing it upon her asshole, and next required 
me to push the fuck into it with the tip of my finger; a dear little 
creature utterly besmeared my buttocks with her shit, behind her 
stood a middle-aged man, he embuggered her while eating the mard 
clean off my ass; I was informed they were father and daughter. 
There were other such couples; I beheld brothers embuggering 
their sisters; fathers encunting their daughters; mothers fucked 
by their children; in a word, every possible scene of incest, of 
adultery, of sodomy, of lechery, of whoring, of foulness, of 
impiety, each under a hundred various forms and a hundred various 
colors took place before my eyes, and surely at no bacchanal of old 
was there ever such a concurrence of so much nastiness and so much 
infamy. 

Weary of the victim’s part, I was eager to play an active role 
in my turn: I intercepted half a dozen young men whose pricks 
attracted me far size, and who now in this sector, now in that, and 
sometimes in both at once, fucked me steadily for nearly two hours. 
At the close of that episode a venerable abbot had himself frigged 
on my clitoris by his niece, a ravishing creature; I sucked her cunt; 
and a handsome young fellow must kiss my behind while he em- 
buggered his mother. Two pretty sisters got me between them, one 
frigged my cunt as the other fluttered about my ass; I discharged, 
quite unaware that their papa was all that time encunting them 
alternately. Another father had me embuggered by his son and in 


440 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the meantime enjoyed the boy in the same manner ; and subsequently 
sodomized me himself while enduring at the hands of his son 
precisely what he had done to him shortly before. A brother en- 
cunted me, his sister—a nun—simultaneously buried her cross in 
his ass. ... And all these supposed outrages to Nature went 
forward amidst a serenity and with an orderliness such as might 
give a moralist pause, and perhaps turn him into a philosopher. For 
indeed, if one but reflects a little, one finds nothing odd in incest; 
Nature allows it, encourages it; only local legislation outlaws it; 
but may something tolzrated in three-quarters of the world be 
truly a crime in the other fourth? Here was an enviable act I had 
not the wherewithal to commit, and the thought saddened me; ah, 
what would I not have given to have had a father or a brother, and 
how ardently I would have surrendered myself to the one or the 
other . .. entreated him to do with me all he wished... . 

Soon I was surrounded by other objects; two pretty sisters of 
eighteen—they were twins—led me off to a privy and bolted the 
door; upon them I executed everything of the most piquant and 
the most disgusting lewdness can suggest. 

‘Were we to attempt to amuse ourselves this way in the 
assembly hall,” they explained to me, “‘twenty of those dreadful 
men would soon be clustered around us squirting their horrid sperm 
left and right; it’s ever so much nicer to have a little privacy, don’t 
you agree?” 

Whereupon the little minxes confessed their tastes to me. 
Fastidious votaresses of their own sex, they found men unbearable 
even to their sight; it was their father who had drawn them into the 
Sodality, though distressed at having to submit to men, they found 
compensation in being zble to have their fill of women. 

“I take it then that you have no intention of marrying?” 

‘Marrying! Never. Death would be a kinder fate than that of 
becoming slaves to hustands.” 

As I plied them with questions, they revealed to me the rest 
of their principles, unzommonly firm for persons of their age; 
brought up philosophically by their father, they were pure of any 
taint of morals or religion, all that had been skillfully weeded out 
of them; there was nothing they’d not done, nothing they weren’t 
ready to do again, and their energy amazed me; such characters 


Juliette & 441 


sorted too nicely with mine for me to keep from expressing my 
feelings, I overwhelmed those delightful girls with caresses; and 
after we had all three loosed very floods of fuck, we promised to 
remain in touch, and started back to the hall. A slender young man, 
noticing me emerge in their company, now came up to me; in an 
anxious undertone he requested a brief interview, and in his com- 
pany I retraced my steps into the privy I had only just left. 

“Great heaven!” said he the moment we were alone, “how I 
shuddered to see you with those two creatures! Beware of them, 
I tell you, be on your guard, they are monsters—monsters who, 
despite their youth, are capable of every conceivable horror—” 

“But,” I put in, “is it not thus one ought to be?” 

He stared at me. ‘“‘To be sure,” he nodded; ‘‘but in one’s 
relations with members one ought to be kindly, respectful, affection- 
ate. Outside, why, steep your sword in blood. Of course. But not 
here. Believe me when I say those two bitches take pleasure only in 
doing mischief to their brothers; wicked, cunning, treacherous, they 
have every trait needed for expulsion from the Sodality, I cannot 
understand why the Permanent Committee does not act. Why, my 
dear, they amuse themselves with somebody and that’s enough, 
from then on their one aim is to destroy you or to enslave you if 
they can. Be grateful to me for having warned you, and thank me 
by turning your ass this way.” 

I supposed he was going to fuck it. Not at all. This odd 
fellow limited himself to plucking out the hairs around my asshole, 
and to licking it; to my protest that he was hurting me he replied 
that owing to his warning I would be spared far worse. After fifteen 
more minutes of this vexatious business we left the privy, although 
my young man had not ejaculated. We parted; and shortly after I 
learned that everything he had said about the two sisters was 
utterly untrue, that calumniating others aroused him, and that, so 
he reckoned, her profound indebtedness to him would lead any 
woman to endure the treatment he subjected her to. 

Sweet music was now to be heard; it was supper being an- 
nounced, and I went with the others inte the voluptuous dining 
hall. It was decorated so as to appear a forest; between the trees 
were countless little glades within each of which was a table set for 
twelve. Garlands of flowers hung in festoons from the trees, 


442 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thousands and thousands of candles, disposed as skillfully as in the 
assembly hall, shed a soft light; two servants delegated to each 
table served it promptly, cleverly, and in silence. Scarcely two 
hundred persons were present, the rest were all in the seraglios. You 
chose the table you wished and there, among friends, splendidly 
regaled, to the sound of enchanting chamber music you gave your- 
self up simultaneously to rhe intemperances of Comus and to all the 
lewd riotings of Cypris. 

Clairwil, back from :he seraglio, had sat down next to me; her 
manifest agitation betokened recent excessive behavior: the hard 
glitter in her eyes, her flushed cheeks, her unloosened hair floating 
over her breasts, the obscene, ferocious language coming from her 
mouth, in everything there were reflections and echoes of the trans- 
port which made her a hundred times lovelier to see; I bent toward 
her and we kissed. 

“Villain,” said I, ‘“‘what ocean of horrors have you been 
swimming in?” 

“Be not envious,” she returned, “when next I plunge back into 
them, and it will be soon, you will be at my side.” 

The two little sisters with whom I'd been afrigging earlier in 
the day, two women of forty and of wit, two other exceedingly 
attractive ones of twenty and twenty-five, and six men made up our 
table. 

Owing to the studied placing of the glades there was not one 
table from which you coald not see all the others; and the cynical 
spirit in which the whole thing had been framed was also evident 
in the fact that no lubricity here in the dining room would be any 
less visible to the observer’s eye than had been that in the assembly 
hall. 

By virtue of these arrangements I was witness to some unusual 
sights; there is no describing the reeling of a vicious brain at such 
times. I had thought myself thoroughly versed in libertinage, 
thought I had nothing further to learn; and that evening I was 
convinced I was yet a callow fledgling. Oh, my friends, what 
impurities, what abominations, what extravagances! Some of the 
celebrants were constantly leaving table and repairing to the la- 
trines, and it was impossible to refuse to do their bidding; the 
desires of Sodality members were laws for the individuals they 


Juliette 2 443 


focused upon. The latter soon found opportunity to demand of 
others what had been demanded of them; wherever you glanced, it 
was masters and slaves you saw; and the slaves, steadied by the 
knowledge that the roles would be reversed shortly, complied 
unhesitatingly with orders it would be their turn to issue in a 
moment. 

Raised upon a throne from which she could oversee every- 
thing, the President maintained order at the supper as before in 
the hall; and the same calm prevailed. Conversations were held in 
a subdued tone; one could easily imagine oneself in the temple of 
Venus, whose statue, moreover, was visible inside a bower of myrtle 
and roses, and the foregathered worshipers, one perceived, taste- 
fully avoided disturbing their rites by any of those rude vocifera- 
tions which are proper only to pedantry and stupidity. 

Rare wines and succulent viands made the after-supper orgies 
even more luxurious than the preceding ones. There was a moment 
when the entire Sodality united in a single immense group; not a 
member was inactive, and nothing could be heard but a deep 
murmur of voluptuous moans accented by the gasps and shrill cries 
heralding discharges. I had further assaults, terrible assaults, to 
sustain, individuals of every sex passed through my hands, not a 
spot on my body was left unsullied; and if I ended up with fearfully 
battered buttocks, mine also was the glory of having wreaked 
havoc upon innumerable others. Day dawned at last and I came 
away so whelmed by fatigue, so dry from delicious exertion that I 
had to keep to my bed for a day and a half. 

My month-long novitiate seemed an eternity; it came finally 
to a close, and mine now was the so hotly coveted right to penetrate 
into the seraglios. Clairwil, eager to acquaint me with everything, 
guided me everywhere. 

Nothing could be as delicious as those seraglios, And that 
holding boys being identical to that offering girls, the description 
of one will give you as well a picture of the other. 

Four large rooms ringed by bedchambers and cells formed the 
interior of each of these isolated wings; the large rooms were for 
the use of those who wished to enjoy themselves publicly, the cells 
for those who preferred privacy in their pleasure; and the inmates 
were lodged in the chambers. Taste and art presided over the 


444 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


furnishing ; the cells especially were of the highest elegance, so many 
little chapels consecrated to libertinage, where nothing lacked that 
might be instrumental to stimulating worship. Four duennas gov- 
erned each seraglio; they took the tickets you brought with you, 
inquired of your desires, and saw speedily to their satisfaction; also 
on hand, ready to offer their services, were a surgeon, a midwife, 
two fustigators, an executioner, and a jailer, all of prodigiously 
melancholy aspect. 

“You are not to think,” Clairwil remarked to me, ‘‘that those 
individuals there have simply been picked at random from the class 
that ordinarily supplies them; they are libertines like us, but less 
prosperous: unable to pay the admission fee, they fulfill their 
functions out of pleasure and just as you would suppose, the job is 
done better in this manner. Some of them receive a stipend, others 
ask only to enjoy a member’s privileges, these are granted them.” 

While on duty those personages wore awesome costumes: the 
jailers had on great belts whence hung rings of keys, the fustigators 
carried about a battery of whips and martinets, and the executioner, 
swart, bare-armed, fearfully moustached, had a cutlass and a stiletto 
at his side. Seeing Clairwil enter, the executioner rose from where 
he was sitting ona stool and greeted her with a kiss. 

‘Have some work for me today, buggeress ?”’ 

‘Look here,” she z.nswered, “I’ve brought you a novice. Count 
upon it, she’ll have at lzast as many chores for you as I.” 

And the wicked fellow, kissing me as he had done my friend, 
assured me that he was in every sense at my command. I thanked 
him, embraced him most warmly, and we resumed our visit of the 
place. 

Each of the four central rooms was reserved for a particular 
category of passion: in the first, you gave way to simple ones, to, 
that is to say, all the various forms of masturbation and fuckery. 
The second room was the theater of fustigations and other irregular 
passions. The third of cruel proceedings; the fourth of murders. 
But as an inmate delegated to any one of these rooms might merit 
imprisonment, the lash. or death, the staff of each included jailers, 
fustigators, and executioners. Women were admitted into the sera- 
glio of boys and into the other of girls, men likewise could frequent 
either. Arriving, we found all the inmates being employed or else 


Juliette & 445 


in their chambers waiting to be put to use. Clairwil opened a few 
doors and showed me some truly heavenly creatures; they were in 
gauze shifts, had flowers in their hair, and welcomed us with an 
air of profoundest reverence. I fell to toying with a lovely thing of 
sixteen ; I was already handling her breasts and cunt when Clairwil 
scolded me for the delicate and unduly decent manner I was 
employing. 

“That’s not the way you behave with this trash,” said she, 
‘they don’t even deserve the honor of being selected for our con- 
sumption. . .. Command, they obey.” 

I altered my tone at once, and my orders were responded to 
with blindest obedience and inspiring alacrity. We entered other 
chambers: the same charms everywhere, the same beauty, every- 
where the same submissiveness. 

“You know,” I confided to Clairwil, “we really must not go 
away without leaving our mark.” 

The thought occurring to me while we were in a chamber 
occupied by a thirteen-year-old girl, pretty as Love herself, by 
whom for better than a quarter of an hour I’d been having my 
cunt and asshole tongued, I immediately chose her for my victim; 
we summoned a fustigator; a duenna led the child off to one of the 
torture chambers; and there, having roped her fast, we bade the 
specialist perform upon the little miss and frigged each other 
while the blood streamed down her body. Clairwil, perceiving the 
fustigator to stiffen, developed his erection and snapped his device 
into her cunt while, at that libertine’s request, I bestowed upon him 
what he had just meted out to our young victim; the scoundrel 
withdrew from Clairwil in order to stuff me, and then we returned 
to whipping the little girl, who when we were finished with her was 
in such a sorry state as to have to be conveyed to the hospital the 
following day. We removed to the seraglio of males. 

‘What have you a mind to do here?” Clairwil wished to 
know. 

“Get my hands on a lot of engines,” was my reply; “I like 
nothing so much as to squeeze a prick, for me it is a delicious 
activity, the gathering of human fuck. I love to glean it, harvest it, 
to see sperm spurt, to feel myself wet by it, to wade and bathe in 
it—” 


446 b& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Well, go ahead then,” said my friend, “do as you like; for 
my part I require a stronger diet. May I make a suggestion? It’s 
an arrangement I sometimes come to with a lady of my acquaint- 
ance: as I dislike having pricks unload in my body, I can neverthe- 
less warm them in my cunt and, when they are hot, turn them over 
to you; which will spare vou the bother of tedious preliminaries.” 

“Excellent.” 

We installed ourselves in the first of the main rooms and 
were sent fifteen lads aged between eighteen and twenty; we 
ranged them in a line in front of us and then sprawled on couches ; 
then by way of defiance Clairwil and I struck the lewdest possible 
attitudes. The most poorly endowed of those boys had a mechanism 
measuring seven inches long by five in circumference, and the 
best, twelve by eight; one by one they moved forward, roused by 
the ardor we kindled in them; Clairwil met each, dallied a little with. 
it, then shunted it on to me; I made them flow over my breasts, 
between my thighs, my buttocks, on my neck and face; reaching 
for the sixth, I felt such a furious itch in the neighborhood of my 
anus that from then on [ presented my behind to everything which 
emerged from Clairwil's vagina: they filled out in her cunt and 
emptied in my ass ; the tempo quickened, they redoubled their efforts, 
but one’s hunger, so to speak, grows from eating, there is nothing 
quite like a woman’s temperament when excited, it is a sort of 
volcano you only further inflame in your attempts to appease it. 
We called for more men; a fresh batch of eighteen arrived; for this 
second round we changed roles; these pricks, and they compared 
very favorably with the fifteen we had just exhausted, caught fire 
in my cunt and died out in the ass of my companion; but we divided 
the task of frigging; ard more than once it befell that, the order 
we had established upset by the excessiveness of our desires, we 
found ourselves with six or seven either in us or exploding all 
around us. 

When finally we zot to our feet, spattered with fuck and 
puddles of it on the couches, like Messalina rising from the bench 
after her lewd bouts with idiot Claudius’ guards, we had each 
been tupped eighty-five times apiece. 

‘My bum itches,’”’ Clairwil declared. ‘““Whenever I’ve been 
grandly fucked I always feel an incredible need of whipping.” 


Juliette % 447 


I admitted to the same longing. 

‘We had better send for a pair of fustigators.” 

‘‘Let’s have four,” said I, “my ass has simply got to be made 
a hash of this evening.” 

“Wait,” said Clairwil, nodding familiarly to a man who en- 
tered just then, “we can perhaps make something dramatic out of 
it.” 

She went over to the newcomer and conferred with him in an 
undertone; he smiled, adopted a threatening air, called to the 
fustigators. ‘Seize them,” he cried; we were seized, our hands 
were tied, and we were both beaten while this man looked on, 
palpating his engine and fondling the buttocks of our assailants; 
when once the blood was fairly Howing down our backs we pre- 
sented cunts to our tormentors who, monstrously pricked, fucked 
each of us twice. 

“And now by way of reward for my cooperation,” said the 
master of ceremonies, “I merely ask you to hold one of these lusty 
fellows while I give his bum a taste of meat.” 

We comply with his request, he sheathes his weapon; the 
others flog him while he ass-fucks; and we, in seventh heaven, 
suckle the whippers’ pricks. 

“T cannot stand it any longer,” said Clairwil, when we found 
ourselves alone; “libertinage leads me fatally to cruelties: let us 
immolate a victim. . . . Did you notice that pretty lad of eighteen 
who kissed me so feelingly ? He was as sweet as an angel to behold 
and gave me all sorts of ideas. Into the torture room with him, 
I say, we'll cut the little dog’s throat.” 

“Fie, Clairwil!” said I. ‘Why didn’t you propose something 
like that when we were in the female seraglio ?”’ 

“It’s simply that I prefer to butcher males, I’ve never pre- 
tended otherwise: I enjoy avenging my sex. And if it be true that 
the other possesses a superiority over ours, is not the fictitious 
offense to Nature all the graver when we kill men?” 

“One would suppose that you regret that this offense is null.” 

“You grasp me aright, my dove, for me it is a source of im- 
mense despair ever to seek the crime and nowhere to find anything 
but the prejudice instead. O fuck! by God’s envenoming fuck, 


448 «ob THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


when,” she sighed, “oh, when, shall I be able to do an authentic 
evil?” 

They fetched us the youth. 

“Shall we need an executioner ?” 

“Don’t you think we can dispatch the thing well enough by 
ourselves ?”’ 

‘“Why, I believe we can try.” 

“Let us.” 

We had our victim installed in an adjoining cell where there 
awaited us everything needed for the piecemeal destruction of the 
young man; his.agony was slow, it was ghastly, the infernal Clair- 
wil drank of his blood and swallowed one of his testicles. Less given 
to these masculine murders than she, my transports were probably 
not so violent; killing a woman, at any rate, would have excited 
me more; be that as it :nay, I discharged copiously; and, quitting 
that seraglio, we directed our steps toward the other. 

‘‘Let’s go to the oom where extraordinary things are ac- 
complished,” I proposed. “If you don’t care to do anything, there 
is no reason why we must; but we shall be able to watch.” 

A man in his forties, he was a priest, had a pretty little girl 
of fifteen hanging by her hair from the ceiling; he was stabbing 
her with a long needle. blood covered the floor, he embuggered 
Clairwil while gnawing my ass. Another was plying a whip over 
the breasts and face of a beautiful girl of twenty: he confined him- 
self to inquiring, would we like to have the same done to us? It was 
by one ankle the third had suspended his victim, most ingeniously, 
we agreed, and laughed merrily at the sight: she looked to be 
about eighteen and superbly made; the position she was in caused 
her cunt to start wide open, into it the villain was ramming a 
wooden member studded with nails. Noticing our presence, he in- 
vited Clairwil to hold the girl’s free leg and to pull on it so as to 
open her cunt farther s:ill, and he had me kneel beside him, order- 
ing me to rub his prick with one hand, to massage his asshole with 
the other: it was not long before Clairwil and I were drenched in 
the blood gushing from the victim. The fourth person in action was 
an elderly magistrate; upon a grill he had chained a delicious 
twelve-year-old and by neans of a huge charcoal brazier, which the 
scoundrel now approached and now drew away, he was roasting her 


Juliette & 449 


by inches; I leave you to imagine what were the screams the poor 
little soul would give vent to whenever her tormentor saw fit to re- 
sume the cooking of her flesh. When he saw us, he shoved the 
stove into place and asked for my ass: I present it, while he drives 
into it he mauls Clairwil’s; but he discharges, ’tis prematurely and 
a calamity: the torture is interrupted while there is yet an hour 
or so of life in the victim, the villain’s joy is cut short, he curses 
us for having come along and spoiled everything for him. 

All this had put me in a sanguine mood, I insisted upon pro- 
ceeding to the murder room; Clairwil was nothing loath to follow 
me: although she was not fond of killing women, neither was she 
opposed to their destruction, her native tigerishness leading her 
to accept whatever flattered her tastes. 

I had twenty girls stood in line and from among them selected 
one of seventeen, she was as engaging a creature as any you have 
ever seen. A vacant cell was designated to me by the duenna, and 
in the three of us went. 

The wretch I was about to sacrifice, fancying I would be sooner 
moved to pity than a man, cast herself at my feet in a ludicrous 
effort to sway me: a very angel for beauty and full of grace, her 
methods would certainly, have succeeded with a less toughened 
adversary, with. someone whose soul was less corrupt than mine. 
I had developed beyond the point where pleas are heard. Rather, 
the only effect her wiles had upon me was to fan the flames of my 
irritation. ... And indeed, even had it not been so, would I have 
dared relent in Clairwil’s presence? After having this lovely girl 
suck me two hours stcaight, after having slapped, buffeted, beaten, 
and thwacked her, after having maltreated her in every conceivable 
way, I had her bound upon a table, and drove a dagger again and 
again into her body while my friend, squatting over me, simul- 
taneously titillated my clitoris, the interior of my vagina, and my 
asshole. Rarely had I enjoyed a happier discharge, I literally dis- 
charged myself dry; and afterward was so exhaustéd I felt it would 
be useless to return to the assembly hall. Instead, I invited Clairwil 
to come home with me; we supped and then retired to bed together. 
It was then that charming personage, inclining to the belief I had 
lacked somewhat of determination in my latest performance, de- 
cided she had best speak to me, and this is what she said. 


450 e» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘The truth, Juliette, is that, a certain undeniable progress not- 
withstanding, your conscience has yet to reach the stage I should 
desire; what I demand of it is that it become so warped as to be 
unable to reassume its former shape; to achieve this there are 
means to employ; I don't mind indicating what they are, but I am 
not so sure you have the strength to apply them. Those means, my 
dearest friend, are simple in themselves: they consist in doing, im- 
mediately, in cold blood, that very thing which, done in the throes 
of passion, has been able to cause you remorse when later on you 
recover your wits. This way you strike squarely and hard at the 
virtuous impulse the instant it bares itself; and this custom of at- 
tacking it head on at the first sign of its reappearance, and it tends 
to reappear once the senses have subsided into calm, this, I say, 
is one of the most certain fashions of destroying it definitively; em- 
ploy this secret, it never fails: directly a moment of calm favors 
the resurgence of virtue, announcing itself under the colors of re- 
morse, for that is always. the guise it wears in its endeavor to regain 
ascendancy over us—then, directly when you perceive it, commit 
forthwith the act you are wont to regret; by the fourth repetition 
of the trick you shall hear the nagging voice of conscience no more, 
and you shall be at peace for the rest of your days. But this is no 
trifling matter, it calls for strength, discipline, and a certain ruth- 
lessness with oneself: it is, you understand, illusion which invests 
crime with its attractiveness, and a weak spirit encounters greatest 
dificulty committing it when, totally self-possessed, illusion there is 
none. The means | propose are valid nonetheless, indeed, I may 
assure you that virtue i:self will safeguard you from remorse, for 
you shall have acquired the habit of doing evil at the first virtuous 
prompting; and to ceasz doing evil you shall have to stifle virtue. 
Oh, Juliette, be sure of it, this is the best advice you are apt to re- 
ceive in this important connection; and you realize its worth, since 
by carrying it out you surmount the most painful of situations, 
victory being yours whether you choose to combat it by vice or to 
annihilate it by virtue.” 

“Clairwil,” said I to my friend, “‘your suggestions are ex- 
cellent, doubtless, but perhaps unnecessary. I am not without ex- 
perience in the profession of vice, and the soul in me requires no 
fortification. Neither does my purpose. Rest assured, you shall 


Juliette & 451 


never see me falter whatever the deed to be perpetrated whether 
for the sake of my material advantage or for that of my pleasure.” 

“Dear heart,” said Clairwil, hugging me to her, “I beseech 
you to have no other gods than those.” 


Somewhat later, Clairwil called upon me and proposed an 
unusual exploit. We were in the season of Lent. 

“Shall we go and make our devotions ?” 

‘Are you mad?” 

“Not at all. I have had a truly extraordinary idea in my head 
for quite a while, and you are the companion I want to have in 
this adventure. At the Carmelite convent there’s a friar of thirty- 
five, the most gorgeous creature in the whole wide world and I have 
had my heart set upon him for the past six months; I simply must 
be fucked by him, and this is how we shall manage it: we shall go 
to have him hear our confession, teli him a few tales, lewd ones, 
he’ll become aroused, I am absolutely certain we need do no more 
to have him make us a proposition: he will explain how we are to 
get together, we'll go to the rendezvous and we'll drain the holy 
brother’s balls... . And more: we'll go to communion after that, 
we'll hide the hosts one way or another and bring them home; 
and at lunch we'll find some not very Christian use to which these 
abject symbols may be put.” 

Here I felt moved to remark to my friend that of her two 
schemes, the first struck me as far more sensible than the second. 

“Once we have ceased to believe in God, my dear,” I pointed 
out, “the profanations you have in mind become so much pure 
childishness, the worse for being useless.’ 

“Childishness, yes,” she rejoined, “that I cannot deny. But 
they excite me mentally and for that I value them. Nothing, in my 
view, is surer proof against backsliding: one cannot accord an 
seriousness to objects one treats in such a manner. May I add that 
I suspect doubts may still be warranted of your firmness in these 
matters ?” 

“Ah, Clairwil, banish them out of your mind!” I retorted 
most energetically. ‘“You err. If anything, my atheism is perhaps 
solider than your own. At any rate, it is not to be bolstered by 


452 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


such nonsense as you have just proposed; I shall join you in these 
undertakings because they please you, but for me they are mere 
amusements at best, and in no wise necessary either to the strength- 
ening of my opinions or to their demonstration.” 

“As you like, my beloved,” said Clairwil, “as you like, we shall 
execute them for pleasure’s sake alone.” 

“Seducing the friar by means of a confession, this is worthy 
of us; but my stars, Clairwil! profaning a wee bit of a wheatpaste 
disk which happens to be the idol of imbeciles, why that amounts 
to no more than tearing up or burning some scrap of paper—” 

“To be sure, but to your scrap of paper no meaning is attached, 
whereas the better part cf Europe assigns a very holy significance 
to that host, to that crucifix, and that exactly is why I am fond of 
profaning them: I hit at public opinion, that entertains me, I vomit 
on the prejudices they strove to inculcate in me when I was young, 
I obliterate them, that excites me.” 

“Let’s be away,” said I. 

We went by carriage; our simple, artless toilettes conformed 
wonderfully to our designs, and Brother Claude, whom we asked 
for and who quickly seated himself in the confessional, could not 
have taken us for anythin:z but models of piety. 

Clairwil opened fire first. It was plain, the poor Friar was 
listing very heavily when my turn came to loose a broadside. 

“Oh, my Father!” ] cooed, “grant me much indulgence for I 
have horrors to divulge to you.”’ 

“Courage, my child.” stammered Claude, “‘great is the good- 
ness and mercy of God, He listens to us with infinite understand- 
ing; what have you to confess ?” 

“Enormities, Father, sins which a frightful libertinage makes 
me commit every day: young though I am, I have violated every 
commandment, I have ceased, yes, ceased to pray and God has 
become a stranger to my soul. Oh, intercede in my behalf, very sore 
is my distress! And my lewd doings . . . ah, you shall tremble when 
you hear about them, I hardly dare speak—” 

“Are you married ?”” 

“Yes, Father, and not a day passes but I outrage my husband 
by behaving in the very worst way.” 

“A lover... a tendency?” 


Juliette & 453 


“An indomitable longing for men in general, and a liking for 
women too—a fondness for every possible variety of debauchery—” 

“You are then, I take it, hot-blooded—”’ 

“Hot-blooded ? Insatiable, Father, that’s what I am, it’s this 
hunger that is dragging me farther and farther into vice, hurling 
me so violently into it that I dread I must succumb in spite of all 
the aid religion can be. .. . Must I avow it, dare I? Oh, Father, at 
this very moment, the pleasure of holding this secret conversation 
with you is upsetting me, aye, convulsing me, counteracting the 
effects of pardon . . . I seek God in this holy place and whom do I 
find? A charming man beneath his cassock and, woe is me, I sense 
myself ready to forget the Lord—”’ 

“My daughter,” said the poor Friar, his voice shaking now, 
“the state you are in afflicts me .. . only great penances—” 

“Ah, the cruelest for me would be never to see you again... . 
Why is it the ministers of God are as though illuminated by 
charms that distract from the sole object which ought to occupy 
us here? My Father, this sanctuary, this interview have not re- 
stored me to serenity, instead I . . . I—oh, heavenly man, your 
words speed to my heart rather than to my mind, I came hither in 
search of peace, but it is restlessness, excitement that has hold of 
me: can we not meet elsewhere? Can we not flee this box, it 
frightens me; and will you not cease a little to be the man of God 
and take the part of Juliette’s lover ?” 

Claude’s erection stamped him as a true Carmelite: the milk- 
white and rose-tipped breast I’d cunningly brought into view, my 
sparkling eyes, gestures, and fumblings which pointed to the 
emotions I was at grips with . . . beside himself, the ecclesiastic 
capitulated. 

“Fair lady,” he replied, and his tone was impassioned, “your 
friend, in a case very like unto your own, has also proposed 
things, ah. . . which your starry gaze inspires and which 1... I 
burn to do, I... . You are two sirens, your sweet words bewitch 
me and I am no longer able to resist—let’s leave the church; I 
have a small room, it is not far from here . . . if you will consent 
to come, I shall do everything in my power to put you at ease.” 

Then, stumbling from the confessional and grasping Clairwil 
by the hand: “‘Follow me, ladies, come with me, the foul fiend has 


454 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


sent you to tempt me; ah, was he not a match for God Almighty 
Himself ? He must then best a poor friar.” 

And out we go. 

Night had fallen, there was no moon; Claude told us to look 
sharply after him but tc: keep twenty paces back. He set off for 
the Vaugirard Barrier, and we soon found ourselves in a mysterious 
and chilly cell; the good Claude offered us cakes and liqueurs. 

“Excellent sir,” my companion said to him, “enough of this 
mystical chatter; we know the kind of man we are dealing with; we 
love you, why, what am I saying? we are quaking from a frantic 
desire to be fucked by you. Join us in laughing at the ruse we em- 
ployed to get this far, contrive to make us feel our efforts have not 
been for nought. Speaking for myself, I tell you I have worshiped 
you for a year and I have been leaking for two hours in anticipation 
of your prick. There,” went on our libertine, tossing up her skirts, 
“there’s where I’d have you lodge it; look, is the cage .not fitting 
for the bird?” 

Promptly flinging ferself upon the bed, the slut had the fel- 
low’s engine out in a trice. 

And an uncommon engine it was. 

“Christ’s tears, will you behold it, Juliette!” cried Clairwil, 
already half swooning away, “here, catch this mast if you can 
get your hands round it, and steer it at me; be a dear, I'll do the 
same for you in a moment.” 

Clairwil is heeded; the bludgeon thunders into a cunt which, 
fuck-moistened already, had been yawning a welcome to it for fif- 
teen minutes. Oh, my friends, how justly they refer to a Carmelite 
when wishing to descr'be the optimum in erected pricks. Our 
Claude’s member, like unto a mule’s, showed nine and three-eighths 
inches round the stem and thirteen inches in over-all length, head 
clear and included; and that formidable head, my friends, I was 
scarce able ta encircle it with both hands. "T'was the noblest, the 
most rubicund mushroora the human imagination can picture. By a 
miracle of Nature, a miracle Nature performs only in behalf of her 
favorites, Claude had been furnished with three balls . . . and how 
full they were! how swollen! "Twas he himself declared it, 
not a drop of sperm had he shed in a month. What torrents thereof 
he spewed into Clairwil’s cunt the moment he touched bottom! and 


Juliette & 455 


into what transports this enormous ejaculation pitched my volup- 
tuous friend! Fucking her, Claude handled me, and his dextrous 
manipulation of my clitoris soon wrung the whey from me too. The 
Friar withdraws; I paw him. Clairwil remains in position. The tool 
dilates, hardens anew in response to my skillful attentions.* Claude, 
breaking away from the hand guiding him, would dive again into the 
gaping vagina.... 

“No, no,” says Clairwil, fending off her impetuous lover, 
“Juliette, make me desire him, lick my clitoris.” 

And Claude, rather than stand idle during these preliminaries, 
falls to caressing: me; while with one hand he holds Clairwil’s cunt 
agape for me, he masturbates me with the other. Like the fiery 
steed that will not be restrained by the bridle or bit, Claude leaps 
into the beckoning hole; and stretching me out beside Clairwil, the 
rascal, gone quite beserk, while furiously fucking the one of us 
pollutes the other with equally prodigious effect. 

“‘He’s assassinating me, the great swine,” shrieks Clairwil, 
swearing like one of the damned; ‘‘ah, by the balls of the bugger- 
fucking Almighty, I can’t resist this buffeting, every blow is cost- 
ing me a pint of sperm—can you not at least kiss me, pig that you 
are? can’t you stick your filthy tongue as deep into my throat as 
you've buried that club of yours in my womb? Ah, by fuck, I’m 
coming—but you, keep yourself in check,” she adds, expelling him 
with a powerful heave of her flanks, ‘‘don’t squander your re- 
sources, I am going to call upon you again.” 

But poor Claude could not contain himself and prepared to 
unleash a second emission; seeing what he was up to, I seized his 
instrument and, stroking it, aimed the boiling flood into Clairwil’s 


4That which you enjoy doing you always do well; and the reader ought not to 
forget Juliette’s affirmation, to wit, that her greatest delight consisted in frigging 
pricks. The statement comes as no surprise, for what else is so voluptuous? To what 
joys does one not thrill, indeed, at the sight of a handsome member rearing in answer 
to the lubricious sensations one imparts to it! How flattering to one’s pride, how stir- 
ring thus to observe one’s handiwork take shape! And the exhilaration of this creative 
activity, especially as the task nears completion; who is there who can refrain from 
discharging himself upon seeing spring forth those divine spurts of semen? Ah, need 
one be a woman to taste this pleasure? What man, be he only mildly sensual, is 
unable to appreciate it? and who, at least once in his life, has not laid an affectionate 
hand upon some other prick than his own? 


456 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


wide-starting cunt. It was with fuck I tried to extinguish the fires 
fuck ignited. 

‘Ah, doublefuck my eyes,” Clairwil expostulated, getting to 
her feet, ‘‘this bugger here would fain break me in two. . . . Juliette, 
you'll not outlive his attack.” 

However, she catckes hold of the Friar, begins to rattle his 
pike; to hasten its elevation, the slut endeavors to mouth him; 
but the engine of this servant of God is too massive to fit between 
her lips; resorting to another stratagem, she pokes two fingers 
into his vent: with the true-born buggers that all friars are, such 
means seldom fail. In response to Clairwil’s libertine questioning 
on this head, Claude allows that, as a youth, he played the bardash 
to his confreres. 

“Why then, we'll fuck you too,” cried Clairwil, bringing 
Brother Claude’s ass into plainer view, kissing his ‘buttocks and 
tonguing his anus. “Yes, we shall sodomize you,” she went on, 
exhibiting a dildo; ‘‘your mistress will turn into your lover. Fuck, 
good friend, I am going to embugger you and afterward you'll em- 
bugger the two of us if you like; see here,” she said, showing 
the Carmelite her behind, “isn’t this as appealing as the cunt you've 
just rioted in? We’re whores, you understand, arrant little whores, 
we're good for any purpose, and when we go somewhere to be 
fucked, it is with the intzntion of having no part of ourselves left 
untouched. To work, great beast, your prick’s aloft: fuck this nice 
little novice who treated you to such a pretty little confession, en- 
cunt her, let that be her penance, and fuck her as hard and as 
roundly as you fucked me.” 

She trundles the awful object toward me, I was lying on the 
bed, my thighs widespread, the altar offered itself to the sacri- 
ficer; but my thoroughgoing libertinage notwithstanding and how- 
ever much I was used tc accommodating the best pricks in Paris, 
I was simply incapable of coping with this one without preparation. 
Clairwil takes pity on rae; with her saliva she anoints both my 
labia and the colossal knob tipping Claude’s device; next, with one 
hand pressing my buttocks so as to close the gap between the target 
and the lance, she managed to-bury it to the depth of perhaps an 
inch, perhaps two. Enheartened by these auspicious beginnings, 
Claude took a firm grip upon my flanks; he swears, he sputters, he 


Juliette & 457 


drools, the gates cede, the fortress falls; but his triumph costs me 
dear, I bleed as never I did the day I lost my maidenhead, and 
the pain is as great; this soon transforms, however, into the 
sweetest sensation of pleasure, and to each of my conqueror’s 
lunges I reply with a telling riposte. 

“Steady there, steady,” cries Clairwil to my rider, “control 
those thrashings, I cannot take fair aim at your ass unless you 
hold still, and I promised to fuck it, you recall.” 

Claude grinds to a halt; Clairwil parts two very fine buttocks: 
a dildo strapped around her loins, the wench bum-stuffs my fucker. 
This operation, so precious to a libertine, nay, so indispensable, 
serves only to increase his agility, he wriggles, he squirms, he 
sounds, he discharges; I have not time enough to get out of the 
way; and even had it happened less rapidly, would I have fled to 
safety? Ah, one is blind to danger when one is drunk from 
pleasure. 

“My turn,” said Clairwil, “‘we shall grant him no quarter. 
Here you are, bugger, my ass thirsts for the mead, in with you 
and draw blood if you can—blood? what care I for the loss of a 
little? Clap on the dildo, Juliette, sodomize him just as I did, and 
I’ll reap the benefits you enjoyed.” 

Claude, aroused by my caresses, by the prospect of the fair 
behind Clairwil presents him and of the laughing hole in its center, 
is not slow to revive; I wet Clairwil’s anus with my tongue and oil 
the holy dart of Christ’s well-furnished minion. Unimaginable, 
the difficulties Claude encounters in penetrating! Twenty times 
over he quails before the enterprise, twenty times must he resume 
the assault; but most cunning is my friend, subtle her maneuvers, 
ardent her desire of that prick, and in the end it is every inch 
housed and to the hairs in her bowels. .. . 

‘‘He’s crippling me,” she shrieks. 

She would escape, she would be rid of the gargantuan glaive 
run into her vitals. Too late. The fabulous weapon is ensheathed 
entire and now belongs as intimately to her as to its wielder. 

“Ah, Juliette,” gasps the hard-pressed Clairwil, “leave this 
bugger be, he’s excited enough as things are at present; I’m in 
far greater need of your hand than his bum is of your dildo; come 
frig me, my child, for I am dying.” 


458 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Despite her pleas, it’s to ass-fucking the Friar I devote my 
main attentions; howbeit, reaching out an arm, I frig my com- 
panion; who, thanks to a lively tickling, faces Claude’s onslaught 
with truly admirable courage. 

“Truly, I overestimated my capacities,” she sighs: “Juliette, 
do not imitate my brashness, it could well cost you your life.” 

Claude is discharging by now: his performance, rare hitherto, 
continues to astonish, the villain bellows and brays, growls and 
grunts, and far, very far inside Clairwil’s bowels, deposits certain 
proof of the pleasure overwhelming him. 

It was a much tattered and torn Clairwil who emerged from 
the fray; I was bent upo. replacing her there. 

“I refuse to permit it,” said she, adamant. “One must not,” 
she added, ‘‘risk one’s well-being for an instant’s vain pleasure; 
this is no man we have here, but a bull. I am prepared to wager 
whatever you like that never before today has he been able to find 
a woman to fuck.” 

And Friar Claude nodded in assent. In all Paris, he declared, 
only his Superior’s asshole had succeeded in compassing his prick. 

“Eh, how’s that? Do you then embugger, wretch ?” Clairwil 
demanded. 

“Frequently.” 

“And thou sayst Mass, thou shrivest, being withal soiled by 
thy dirty practices?” 

“Why not? Amongst men the greatest believer is he who 
serves the most gods. 

“Mesdames,” went on the ecclesiastic, seated between us and 
fondling an ass with each hand, ““Mesdames, do you really fancy 
we set any more store by religion than you do? Dwelling closer 
to the being it presupposes, we are in a better position than others 
to perceive the features of the falsehood; religion is all a shoddy 
fiction, true, but it provides us with a living and the merchant must 
not disparage his wares. We traffic in absolutions and gods the way 
a pander sells whores; ‘or all that, aré we otherwise fleshed than 
yourselves, insensible to your passions? and do you think some 
ridiculous unctions, a few absurd affectations and smirks are sure 
protection against the stings of human instinct? Far from it. ‘The 
passions, writes a wise author, ‘acquire additional force beneath

the frock, the heart harbors those seeds, example brings them to 
flower, idleness fertilizes them, occasion causes them to multiply— 
resist the passions? By what possible means?’ It is in the ranks 
of the clergy, my dear ladies, that you find the authentic atheist; 
doubters you may be, you others, skeptics perhaps, but you cannot 
even begin to realize the hollowness of the idol; whereas we, its 
ministers, we to whom its care is entrusted, there’s not a one of 
us who is not convinced of its inexistence. All the revealed religions 
you come across in the world are full of tenebrous dogmas, unin- 
telligible principles, unbelievable wonders, astounding stories, the 
whole mumbo jumbo invented, apparently, for the sole purpose of 
insulting the intelligence and flouting common sense; without excep- 
tion they all announce an invisible God whose existence is un- 
fathomable. The behavior ascribed to him is as puzzling, as incon- 
ceivable, as his very essence; if he existed, would the divinity have 
spoken in such riddles? what’s to be gained from revealing yourself 
merely to.talk nonsense? The greater the freight of mysteries it 
carries, the less accessible to the comprehension a religion is and 
the more it pleases the fools who wallow in it as in their element; 
the more shadowy, obscure, and dubious a religion, the diviner it 
looks to be, the closer, that is, it conforms to the nature of a 
hidden and intangible being of whom no clear notion can be formed. 
Tis a characteristic of ignorance to prefer the unknown, the fan- 
tastic, the farfetched, the incredible, indeed, the terrible, to what- 
ever is forthright, simple, and true. Truth titillates the imagina- 
tion far less than fiction; the vulgar ask for nothing better than 
to listen to the preposterous fables we retail; inventing religions 
and forging mysteries, priests and lawgivers catered splendidly to 
the desires of the rabble; by means of creeds and codes they 
gathered a following of enthusiasts, women, and simpletons; such 
individuals dispense very easily with proofs they are incapable of 
examining; love of the simple, love of truth are to be found only 
amongst those, and they are few, whose imagination is governed by 
study and by reflection. No, Mesdames, no, be assured of it, there is 
no God, the existence of that infamous phantom cannot possibly 
be imagined, and all the contradictions it is composed of suffice to 
explode it—we need but deign to inspect it closely and poof! it is 
no more.” 


460 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


During this discussion, the Friar, seated between us, as you 
know, was palpating our asses. 

“Beautiful behind,” he murmured, alluding to mine, “what a 
shame not to be able to thread that strait. . . . But perhaps, if we 
were to try. .... Oh, Madame, with a little kindness on your part— 
for surely, one so fair cannot be so-cruel—”’ 

“Brute,” said I, rising from my chair, “I'll not even lend 
you my cunt, it still smarts from what you did to it and I am 
not eager-to subject myself to worse. Catch hold of him, Clairwil, 
we'll make him discharge till the blood seeps from his balls, other- 
wise he’ll give us no peace.” 

We laid him upon the bed, Clairwil clamped his member be- 
tween her breasts and I, squatting over his nose, had him kiss the 
door to the temple I forbade him to enter; he tongued it timidly at 
first, then more boldly, and sliding a hand to my bush fell to exer- 
cising my clitoris; and once again we discharged. 

Clairwil asked the Friar whether there were other such liber- 
tines as he in his monastery; upon Claude's affirmation that there 
were at least thirty, my “riend wanted to know if it might be pos- 
sible to pass an evening amidst the whole brotherhood. 

“Certainly,” Claude answered, ‘if ever you wish a memorable 
fucking you have only to come and you will be treated royally—and 
to more than you bargain for, I dare say.” 

Clairwil then asked if the impious revels she had her heart 
fixed upon could also be held at the monastery. 

“Better there than elsewhere,” said the Carmelite, ‘‘you shall 
be able to do whatever you like under our roof.” 

‘““My dear,” Clairwil said, “rather than join you only to be 
disappointed, pray go znd speak to your Superior; explain the 
matter to him; bring back his response, we shall attend you here.” 

As soon as the Friar had departed, Clairwil turned to me, a 
wicked glitter in her eye. “Juliette,” said she, ‘‘you’ll not be sur- 
prised to hear it: that fellow fucked me well, too well for me not 
to desire his death—”’ 

‘What! Are you already plotting the wretch’s undoing ?” 

“The loathing I have for men once they have satisfied me is 
in direct proportion to the pleasure I have had from them, and it’s 


Juliette & 461 


been a great while since I’ve discharged so exquisitely. . .. He must 
die, I say. Two means occur to me: that of having him placed in 
pace by his Superior—to arrange this we need merely intimate to 
that chief the dangers involved in having such a person as Claude 
at large, a person capable of blathering the secrets of the house to 
all and sundry. But by proceeding this way he is entirely lost to me; 
and I have designs on his wondrous engine. . . .” 

“But how are these projects to be carried out if you have him 
put to death?” 

“T see no reason why we might not induce him to spend twenty- 
four hours with us at your country estate; for the rest, never fear. 
... Ah, Juliette, what a dildo hangs under that bugger’s belly!” 

My friend declining to enlighten me further, while waiting for 
the Friar we passed the time inspecting his quarters. 

It was a mine of obscene engravings and literature that we 
turned up: the first volume was Le Portier des Chartreux,® more a 
bawdy production than a libertine one and which, despite the touch- 
ing candor and sincerity permeating. it, was, according to rumor, 
disowned by the author as he lay on his deathbed. Bah, what folly. 
The fellow capable at such a time of repenting what he dared say or 
write in the course of his life is a rank coward, whose memory ought’ 
to be execrated by posterity. 

The second was L’Académie des Dames, a well-conceived 
work but poor in the execution; done by a fainthearted man who 
seems to have scented the truth but was afraid to tell it; and full 
of boring conversations. 

L’ Education de Laure was the third book we found. Another 
complete failure owing to extraneous and false considerations 
dominating the composition. Had the author brought the wife- 
murder frankly onto the stage, instead of leaving it off somewhere 
in the wings, and made something substantial of the incest, which he 
hints at constantly but never explores; had he increased the number 
of lewd scenes . . . shown in action those cruel tastes he restricts 
himself to mentioning, abstractly, in his preface, the work, most 
imaginative, would have been delicious: but tremblers are my

despair, I lose all patience with them and would prefer a hundred 
times over that they write nothing rather than give us bare ideas 
only, and in halves at that. 

Thérese philosophe was there, a charming performance from 
the pen of the Marquis d’Argens,® alone to have discerned the 
possibilities of the genre, though only partially realizing them; 
alone to have achieved happy results from the combining of lust 
and impiety. These, speedily placed before the public, and in the 
shape the author had initially conceived them, finally gave us an 
idea of what an immoral book could be. 

The others were all examples of those deplorable little pam- 
phlets commonly got uf in coffeehouses or in brothels and which 
regularly reveal mean-spirited buffoons toiling at the instigation of 
hunger and under the guidance of some burlesque muse; lust, the 
child of opulence and of superiority, cannot be treated save by 
persons of a certain condition, of a certain quality—that is, by 
persons who, favored by Nature at the outset, have after that 
benefited from wealth enough to be able themselves to try what 
they describe in their lewd pages. Well, as we are reminded by their 
gropings and feebleness of expression, such experience is totally 
denied the smutty fellows who flood us with the low scribblings I 
am speaking of, among which I do not hesitate to include those of 
Mirabeau, who in order to be something would fain be a libertine 
and who in fact throughout the whole of his life was nothing at 
all.” 

Pursuing our search through Claude’s belongings, we came 
upon dildoes, cat-o’-nine-tails, articles from which we were able to 
deduce the extent to which the Friar was familiar with libertine 
practices; and now he returned. 

“T have,” he reported, ‘‘my Superior’s formal consent, you 
may come whenever you wish.” 

“It shan’t be long before we do, my friend,” said I; “after

No, nothing, not even a legislator. Very conclusive evidence of the misjudgment 
and the folly which, in France, characterized the year 1789 is supplied in the ri- 
diculous enthusiasm stirred up by that miserable monarchist spy. What today is the 
general opinion of that unwell and exceedingly unclever individual? He is considered 
a knave, a traitor, and a dunce. 


Juliette & 463 


being so liberally entertained by a single member of the order, we 
cannot but anticipate wonders from the rest: no need to tell you 
we have fiery cunts, from what you have already seen of them you 
may judge what they will be able to undertake when still better 
served. While waiting, Claude, let me invite you to pay us a visit; 
my friend and I will be delighted to receive you at a pleasant little 
place I own in the country, and where we are going in three days’ 
time. Will you come? You will enjoy yourself. Between now and 
then, let me recommend repose. Don’t fail us.” 

The opportunity being present, we thought best to have a 
word with the Superior. He proved to be a handsome man of sixty, 
who greeted us with. utmost cordiality. 

“Ladies, we will be most happy to welcome you,” he declared, 
“among the thirty friars who are worthy to participate in these 
orgies, I promise you a score between the ages of thirty and thirty- 
five who, membered like Claude and possessing the vigor our voca- 
tion expects, will treat you according to your highest hopes. As 
regards secrecy, you have no cause for fears which may not be 
groundless when such activities are undertaken in mundane sur- 
roundings. You said, did you not, that you are interested in a few 
impieties ? Ah, we know all about those little matters, leave every- 
thing to us, ours are capable hands. Fools maintain that monks are 
good-for-nothings; we mean to prove to you, Mesdames, that 
Carmelites at least are excellent for fucking.” 

Language so forthright following upon our late trial of Claude 
eliminated any last vestige of doubt about the spirit in which we 
would be entertained; we therefore notified these honorable an- 
chorites that we would avail ourselves of their hospitality and, 
furthermore, bring with us two pretty girls to collaborate in and 
further our amusements; the which, despite our vexation at having 
to postpone them, could not, owing to various pressing affairs that 
would detain us, be scheduled before Easter. 

That date was acceptable to our hosts and, Clairwil remarked 
as we came away, appropriate to the impieties she was still medi- 
tating. “I don’ t care what others say,’ she insisted, “I am going to 
derive pleasure from profaning the holiest mystery of Christianity 
during that very period of the year when one of Christianity’s great 
holidays falls.” 


464 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Easter lay nearly a month off and this interval being marked 
by two outstanding occurrences, I believe I shall speak of them at 
this point before relating what followed in the way of our liber- 
tinage among the Carmelites. 

The first of these events was the tragic death of Claude; the 
unlucky chap arrived in the country on the appointed day; Clairwil 
was there with me; we introduced him into the most pleasurable 
surroundings, he was in seventh heaven and when his prick had 
attained to full and towering erection, then my wicked friend, 
signaling to the five women to seize him suddenly and pinion him, 
sliced that peerless member off with a razor, severing it close; later 
giving it to be prepared by a learned physician, she thus acquired 
herself the most extraordinary and I dare say the biggest dildo 
you have ever clapped eyes on. Claude departed this world in 
dreadful pain, his agony was not pretty to see: the sight of it fed 
Clairwil’s lubricious ragre, and as she watched him expire, three 
women and I frigged her at a distance of two feet from her victim. 

“So now,” the whore said to me after having splashed her 
fuck over us, “did I not tell you a means had been found for doing 
away with the bugger without losing him altogether?” 

I now come to the second of these two events; and I do not 
suppose it is any more to the honor of my soul than the stunt | 
have just finished describing was to my friend’s. 

Surrounded by a crowd of sycophants and clients who seemed 
to be thinking that their fate lay in my lap, I was occupied with my 
toilette when a servant ushers in a middle-aged man, visibly of 
mean condition, and who begs me for a brief private interview. I 
have it explained to the fellow that I am not in the habit of receiv- 
ing such folk as he, that if the matter be one of aid, or a good word 
spoken to the Minister, the case may be presented to me in writing 
and I will consider whe:her anything can be done; but the shabby 
visitor will not be put of. More from curiosity than anything else, 
I decide to give him aucience and have him wait in the little draw- 
ing room where I held private parleys at the time; then, instructing 
my servants to remain within call, I go to find out what business has 
brought this individual to me. 

“My name, Madame, is Bernole,” the stranger begins, ‘‘a 
name with which you are surely unacquainted. It would be less 


Juliette & 465 


unfamiliar to the mother you lost, to that excellent woman who, 
were she alive, would not allow you to continue this however 
lucrative existence of shameless disorderliness and misbehavior.” 

“Sir,” I interrupt, “your tone does not strike me as fitting to 
somebody who has come to ask a favor... .” 

“Softly, Juliette, softly,’ Bernole replies, “it is nonetheless 
possible that I am going to ask you a favor and equally possible 
that I have rights that allow me to adopt this tone which dis- 
pleases you.” 

“Whatever be your rank, Sir, I would have you know that—”’ 

“And I would have you know, Juliette, that if I have come to 
ask your help, you ought to be flattered by the request. Kindly look 
at these papers, young lady: a glance will inform you of my need 
of that help and at the same time of your duty to grant it.” 

I had but to scan those documents. ‘“‘My God,” I gasped, 
“what, my mother! She was guilty . . . and with you?” 

“Precisely, Juliette; I am your father,” and Bernole spoke 
most crisply. “I brought you into this world—I was a cousin of 
your mother, my parents had prepared the match, we were already 
betrothed when the offer of another marriage, a more advantage- 
ous one, induced them to alter their plans. They sacrificed your 
mother—at a time when she was pregnant, you were in her womb. 
She and I contrived to deceive the man whom you knew as your 
father, he was completely taken in. You are not his child, but mine; 
I can prove it. Below your right breast is a birthmark, a brownish 
spot the size of a small coin. . . . Juliette, have you one such mark ?” 

“T do, Sir.” 

“Then recognize your father, oh, cold, unfeeling soul! Or if 
you are not willing to believe me, read through these papers with 
a little attention, they will banish every shred of doubt. After the 
death of your mother . . . and it was a horrible death, the vicious 
doing of one Noirceuil, the same with whom you, excused by no 
ignorance of the facts, dare maintain a criminal relationship, and 
who would be broken on the wheel tomorrow if only we had the 
necessary evidence—and, unfortunately, it is lacking; after her 
death, I say, I was deluged by every imaginable piece of misfortune. 
All I had, I lost. I lost all your mother left me as well. For eighteen 
years now I have subsisted thanks to public charity alone; but I have 


466 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


found you at last, Juliette, and all my sufferings are soon to be 
over....” 

“Sir, I have a sister who in all likelihood is still floundering 
amidst hardships caused by the prejudices I rid myself of very 
early on; is she also your child ?” 

“Justine ?” 

‘That is correct.” 

‘She is indeed my daughter. The woman who bore her loved 
me, that love endured despite every obstacle; I alone had the joy 
of making her a mother.” 

“Great heaven!” cried the unhappy Justine, ‘‘my father lived 
and | knew him not! Dear God, had Thou but brought us together 
I would have been a comfort to him and soothed him in his distress, 
I would have shared with him the little I had and my sympathy 
would have compensated for the unkindness which, sister, he had 
probably to endure at your hands.” 

‘“‘My child,” declared the Marquis, out of all patience with 
Justine after the night he had spent with her, “if you are allowed 
the honor of being present at this gathering, it is not to afflict us by 
your jeremiads. Pray continue, Madame.” 

Knowing me as you do, my friends, you must realize that this 
affair was distasteful to me, in as much as there are few souls so 
poorly attuned to gratitude and filial sentiments as mine; I’d not 
dropped one tear at the loss of the person I had always assumed to 
be my father, would it have been natural for me to be moved by 
the calamities which had befallen this other one fate restored to 
me? And the bestowing f alms, I need hardly remind you, was not 
a pastime to which I was much given; I considered charity the worst 
use money could be put to; and this insolent beggar might talk as 
he liked about being my father, the fact remained that to satisfy 
him I had either to pa:t with some silver or plead in his favor 
before a Minister who, quite as stern, quite as unbending as | in his 
attitude toward such matters, could hardly be expected to lend a 
complacent ear to my im portunings. To be sure, this individual was 
my father, of that there could be no question, the proof was there, 
but to it Nature incited in me no response at all, none. It was with 
sheer indifference I stared at the person standing in front of me. 
The silence lasted several minutes. 


Juliette * 467 


“Sir,” said I at last, “the tales you tell me may be perfectly 
true; however, I see not the faintest reason for being obliged to 
listen to them. I have principles, Sir, steadfast principles which, 
unluckily for you, are totally incompatible with this commiseration 
you implore. As for the titles of paternity, here you are, I hand 
you back the papers which establish them, and let me also give you 
the assurance that I haven’t the least need of them: whether I have 
a father or whether I do not have a father, you would surely have 
trouble realizing how little I care. And so my advice to you, Sir, 
is to relieve me very promptly of your presence unless through 
obstinacy you wish to compel me to have you thrown bodily out 
that window.” I rise, intending to ring for my servants without 
further ado; but Bernole rushes forward, stays my hand. 

“Ungrateful child!” he cries, “do not punish me for a sin 
over which I have shed a lifetime’s tears—you are of illegitimate 
birth, aye, alack, but does my blood not run in your veins for all 
that? and do you not owe me your aid? If you cannot heed the 
feelings Nature seems to have forgot to put in your breast, will you 
not hark to the plaintive accents of misery and of despair ?” Sinking 
down before me, clutching my knees, wetting them with his tears, 
“Juliette,” says he, gazing up at my face, “Juliette, enormous 
wealth is thine, and it is but a crust of bread thy penniless father 
begs of thee! Girl, think on thy mother, wouldst thou refuse succor 
to the man who loved her? The only man to have loved her who 
bore thee nine months in her womb, hast thou no respect for him? 
Attend the prayer of the lowly, else Heaven shall smite thee in thy 
wickedness.” 

Undeniably, pathos abounded in the wretch’s speech; but 
there are hearts which harden. rather than melt before the efforts 
of those who strive to appeal to them. Like the kind of wood that 
toughens when exposed to fire, it is in the very element which one 
would suppose ought to consume them that they acquire an added 
degree of force. Thus, instead of exciting sentiments of compassion 
in me, Bernole’s antics were fast hurling me into that lubricious 
furor which the refusal to perform a good action begets, a mild 
version, this, of what happens inside us when we acquit ourselves 
of an evil one. At first it was the icy stare of indifference I bent 
upon Bernole; my glance now warmed, became the fiery one of 


468 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleasure; and my throat constricted as there filtered through my 
veins that perfidious delight which fastens upon us at the thought 
or the recollection or the designing of an act of badness;* my brows 
knit, my breathing quickens, and feeling myself grow ever harsher 
because this harshness is agreeable, because it is arousing . . . 
because I am readying to discharge. . . . “I have told you,” I declare 
to the boor groveling at my feet, “that I don’t care who you are, 
that I shall never care who you are, and that I never give anything 
to the needy; and so I shall say it once again, and this shall be the 
last time: kindly get out of here. Or do you want to rot in some 
dungeon ?”’ 

A wave of madness sweeps over the man: employing now im- 
precations, now pleas, then invectives and then expressions of 
endearment, he beats his head against the floor, opens a gash in his 
brow, my apartment is spattered with his blood. . . . This blood is 
my blood; I watch it well forth, and I am happy. Happiness chokes 
me. After several exqu:site minutes, I ring. 

“Expel this clown from my house,” I instruct my servants, 
“forcibly; but get his address before you do.” 

I was obeyed. . . . Overwrought, inflamed, I was obliged to 
have immediate resort 1:0 my women who were two hours toiling to 
restore me to my senses. Mighty effect of crime upon a heart like 
mine! It was written in the sacred book of Nature, that everything 
apt to outrage the Nature common spirits invariably’ misunder- 
stand was sure to constitute, for me, the means to pleasure. 

Both Noirceuil and the Minister were dining with me that day; 
I asked the former, was he acquainted with an individual called 
Bernole, who claimed to have been my mother’s lover and to have 
fathered me? 

“Yes,” said Noirceuil, “I knew a Bernole. He had investments 
with your father and Lis money was lost along with your family’s 
when I operated its ruia. If I remember rightly he was indeed fond 
of your mother, over whom he fairly grieved when she was gone; I 
dare say it was through no fault of his I wasn’t hanged. . . . Do 
you mean to tell me the fellow is still about ? Then it is high time he 
were put properly out of the way.” 


8 See, set forth above, the natural philosophy accounting for these effects. 


Juliette &® 469 


“‘We can lodge him in the Bastille before the day is out,” said 
Saint-Fond. “Juliette has only to ask—” 

“No,” Noirceuil broke in, “it would be a mistake to hurry, for 
there are possibilities here, it seems to me. I already envisage a 
pathetic scene—”’ 

“Exactly,” I said. “And dungeons—piffle, such scoundrels 
merit worse than that. Noirceuil and you, Saint-Fond, you have 
labored earnestly at the reformation of my soul; that your efforts 
have not been vain is going to be proven upon this occasion. Since 
we are to trouble to commit a piece of mischief, we might as well 
make it a full-blown crime. The plan is simple, there can be no 
other: while the dog dies by my hand you'll be fucking me.” 

“Blast me,” exclaimed the Minister, quaffing off another glass 
of champagne, “you are marvelous, Juliette.” And divesting himself 
of his breeches, ‘‘What a mind the child has. She has but to air a 
thought and lo! my prick soars. Do you really believe you shall have 
the determination to execute your scheme ?” 

“IT swear it upon the head of this prick I inspire,” said I, catch- 
ing hold of the purpling member Saint-Fond had just enlarged. 

And I being bent forward at the moment, Noirceuil advanced 
a hand toward my ass while gripping his risen stave hard. “By 
fuck, Saint-Fond, I always told you she was a delicious creature, did 
I not?” and he scraped his engine between my parted buttocks. 

“Come, come, gentlemen, hear me out if you please. The un- 
dertaking must be embellished by some pretty details. It strikes me 
that Bernole and I ought to meet again: I’ll tell him I am dread- 
fully sorry about what happened today, declare it was all a mis- 
understanding, I’ll deceive him by means of advances, we'll kiss, 
don’t you know, I'll have him in love with me in half an hour, 
beside himself, out of his mind, he’ll stick me. . . . No, that’s not 
enough, he has got to embugger me . . . and he will. You, Saint- 
Fond, at this point you'll suddenly appear, at the critical instant 
you'll burst into the room, the instant, that is to say, he is about to 
discharge: you are my lover, you are furious, you intend to punish 
me, pointing a dagger to my breast you enjoin me to kill Bernole 
or perish myself. So I kill him, of course. We shall include Clairwil 
in the scene, she will surely be able to contribute something original 
to it.” 


470 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Discussions preparatory to a crime never fail to please rascals. 
These two waxed so enthusiastic as they listened to me that there 
was shortly no restraining them anymore. The door to a boudoir 
opens, several individua's join us as auxiliaries, and my ass receives 
plenteous offerings from each of these monsters whom my perfidi- 
ous imaginings had hurled into a very lather of lust. The storm 
abated, a draft for five hundred thousand francs was delivered to 
me, and with it I had the promise of a million payable the day the 
project was enacted. 

The prospect of this reward tempted me sorely; impossible to 
turn back now. I rush to my estate; there, I take pen in hand and 
write to Bernole. Kind Sir, I begin, filial devotion has found its 
way into my heart at last, and as I write I weep: it is the pure 
country air, apparently, that has dispelled the ferocity we inhale 
from the foul atmosphzre of Paris; come visit me here in these 
idyllic rustic surroundir gs, in this place where Nature reigns un- 
contested, and let me give vent to the feelings Nature inspires in 
me for you. My man arrives. ... Ah, the joy of duping him, very 
sweet it was, sweet beyond belief or telling; I was fairly quaking 
from delight. The first thing I did was display to him the luxurious- 
ness of my circumstances, he was dazzled; my artful caresses com- 
pleted his seduction. 

After we had supped in richest style, “By what possible 
means,” I asked, “can I hope to right the wrongs I did you, all 
because of my wicked mind? Monsieur Bernole,” I declared, ‘my 
position is not easy. I was afraid. I must watch my step very closely. 
I am the Minister’s confidante, his friend; great is his power, he 
need but lift a finger and I am doomed. In you, as you stood before 
me, I detected nothing of a father; no, let me, say it out, the emo- 
tions which assailed me were not a daughter’s, they were something 
a thousand times more “ender and more delicate, and that accounts 
for why, dreading lest I succumb to them, I was obliged to feign 
coldness, to behave harshly, aye, cruelly. What else could I do? 
Overcome by affection, by the most sacred love. . . . Eh, Bernole, 
you loved my mother, I would also have you love me; but if we are 
to know happiness together, discretion is required of us both, 
discretion, that is all; are you such a man as a woman may rely 
upon ?” ; 


Juliette ob 471 


The upright and decent Bernole shuddered at hearing these 
words. 

“My Juliette,” replied he, deeply stirred, “I seek to reawaken 
your sense of filial love only; that alone is due me, religion and 
honor, to which I am yet attached, prevent me from accepting any 
other. Tax me not with immorality for having lived out of wed- 
lock with your mother: we both believed that such voluntarily 
contracted ties as bound us together were valid in the eyes of 
heaven, and these we respected; ‘twas not lawful, what we did. I 
am aware of that, I was aware of it then, but our error was one 
Nature comprehends and forgives, but what you propose to me is 
abhorrent to her.” 

‘Why, Bernole, yours is a benighted mind!” I cried, my 
solicitations having brought me to the point of kissing him and 
laying a hand upon his thigh. “You whom I adore, alas,” I went 
on with mounting heat, “‘are my sentiments of no interest to you? 
Come give life a second time to her whose sole glory is to have 
been sired by you: my first existence I owe to love, let me owe it 
another also; you gave me life, will you not make that life worth 
living? Oh, my Bernole, ’tis so, ’tis so: without you I must die.” 

Two breasts white as snow and prettily shaped, which as 
though by accident pop into sight that same moment, eyes full of 
dreamy longing, of languor, and of lust . . . straying hands wander- 
ing up the paternal legs to unbutton the paternal pantaloons and 
with skill to fondle and stroke the half-stiffened instrument that 
brought me into this world; at length Bernole’s reluctant passions 
are roused.... 

‘Good God, what are these assaults,” he exclaims, ‘‘and how 
am I to withstand them? How spurn the living image of her whom 
I worshiped up until the very end?” 

‘‘And today, Bernole, your beloved is restored to you—behold 
in me she whom you loved in the past—she breathes; by the sweet 
kisses her mouth thirsts after bring her entirely back to life—ah, 
do you realize the state you are putting me in?” I demand. “Only 
see,” I add, lifting my skirts, flinging myself upon a couch, “yes, 
look, look, and resist if you dare.” 

Gullible Bernole, quite swept off his feet, falls into the trap I 
have laid for his virtue; she who caresses the sot is thoughtful only 


472 .% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of the base scheme that is soon to procure his undoing. Possessed 
of a vibrant member, wiry, spirited, and above all uncommonly 
long, Bernole fucked very adequately, yes, delightfully; stimulated 
by his performance I treated him generously, clutched his buttocks 
and pulled him firmly to me. That for awhile; then, slithering down 
beneath him, I merrily pump this prime cause of my existence; after 
which, resuming my place, I pack him away into my cunt, ball-deep: 
inordinately heated by ray tricks, Bernole looses a discharge; I 
answer with one of my own, as my incestuous entrails become host 
to a fresh batch of the sane seed he sowed long ago in my mother’s 
womb. Thus did I conceive. I shall tell you about my pregnancy a 
little later on. 

Unhinged by love, under the sway of that deity forgetting the 
dictates of the honor and the probity which had so well ruled his 
conduct hitherto, Bernole implores me to let him stay the night. 
Greatly excited by the idea of being fucked by the father my 
viciousness has passed the death sentence upon, | consent to every- 
thing. Bernole’s efforts surpassed my hopes: I was soundly tuppered 
seven times over, and all zhe while obsessed by my ferocious designs, 
out-discharged him two to one as I dwelt upon the prospect of 
burying on the morrow tim who had been so ill-starred, first to be 
my father, then, worse yet, to give me such pleasure. Midway 
along in our exercises, alluding to my dread lest carelessness lead 
to a pregnancy that would discover our intrigue, I steered round 
an exquisite ass by way cf suggestion that he change itinerary: but 
crime, alas, was so foreign to my virtuous father’s heart that, would 
you believe it? he proved not to have the least notion how to go 
about these infamies (infamies, I borrow his expression) which, he 
was at pains to have me understand, if he performed them, it was 
out of prudence and excess of love; the well-tooled sophist buggered 
me thrice—these rehearsals were necessary for the play that was 
to be staged the next day; so keen was their effect upon me I fainted 
away from pleasure. 

There arrived that longed-for tomorrow when I was t6 savor 
the unspeakable charms of a crime I was in a perfect panic of 
eagerness to perpetrate. I looked forth upon the day in its dawn- 
ing: Nature, whom I was about to outrage so gravely, had never 
appeared to me in such beauty; and glancing in a mirror I saw 


Juliette 473 


myself as prettier, healthier, more winsome than ever I had been 
before; within me there were hidden stirrings, never had they 
needled me so sharply, so imperiously as now they did. Rising from 
my bed, I sensed myself dominated by a lust .. . by a wickedness... 
I was devoured by a craving for abominations; and in me there was 
something beyond words bitter: it was despair at being incapable 
of carrying horror to the full extent described by my desires. . . 

*Tis a crime I am soon to commit, I mused, something which 
would be commonly held a very black crime. But though it be black, 
though it be heinous, it is only one crime. And what is a single crime 
to a person who wishes only to live in the midst of a multitude of 
crimes, who wishes to live for the sake of crime alone, who idolizes 
it and nothing else ? 

The whole morning I was restive, gloomy, testy, I fidgeted. 
I flogged two of my female hirelings, I was cross; I teased a child 
that had been entrusted to the care of one of them, then lured it 
into tumbling out a window: it died from the fall, this lifted my 
spirits somewhat, and I spent the remainder of the day at all sorts 
of little japeries, whiling the time away at all sorts of little 
savageries. I thought the promised supper would never arrive; but 
it did at last. I had issued orders that it be as lavish as the other of 
the day before, and as I had done then, I again drew Bernole upon 
a couch and flashed him my ass. Into it the ninny plunged, fuddled 
by my meaningless amorous prattle. An instant or two later the 
door is flung open and in storm Clairwil, Noirceuil, and Saint- 
Fond, swearing and armed; Bernole is dragged off my back and 
bound hand and foot. 

“Juliette,” a raging Saint-Fond declares, “you deserve to be 
butchered along with this monster for having betrayed the trust I 
have always placed in you. Would you live, eh? Then you have no 
choice: there are three balls in this pistol, take it and blow the 
churl’s brains out.” 

“Great heaven!” I shrilled theatrically. ““What are you de- 
manding of me? This man is my father—” 

“A father-fucking slut ought to be able to do a little father- 
killing.” 


“The choice is impossible—” 


474 <b» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘Rubbish. Come, be quick about it: take this pistol instantly, 
or die yourself.” 

‘Woe is me,” I sighed, “my hand trembles, give me the 
weapon nevertheless. What must be, must be,” said I; “beloved 
father, will you pardon this act ? I am under constraint, you observe 
it—”’ 

“Vile creature,” Bernole answered, “do as you are told. Aye, 
go ahead. But spare me having to listen to you. I do not wish to be 
made a fool of.” 

“Very well then, papa,” said Clairwil gaily, ‘since you don’t 
wish to be made a fool of, you shan’t be: just as you have guessed, 
your death is of your daughter’s contriving—and right indeed she 
is to want to murder the great scoundrel you must be for ever 
having given life to such a child.” 

Preparations are made forthwith: Bernole is tied to a chair 
fixed by spikes to the floor; I take up a position ten feet from him. 
Saint-Fond stretches out upon a divan and fits his member in my 
anus, Noirceuil supervising the introduction with one hand, strok- 
ing his own instrument with the other; to the right Clairwil is 
tonguing Saint-Fond’s mouth and tickling my clitoris. I take aim. 

“Saint-Fond,” I inquire, “shall I wait until you wet me?” 

“No, foul bitch,” he shouts, ‘kill him, kill him, the shot will 
bring my sperm out.” 

I fire. The ball enters Bernole’s brow; he expires; and with 
wild screams we all four discharge. 

Barbarous Saint-Fond rises and goes to peer at the victim; 
he stands over the body a long time, manifestly in ecstasy. (He 
always adored such situations.) He calls my name, would have 
me look also. ... Wh le I do he casts sidelong glances at me, 
studying my reaction; my sang-froid satisfies him. With a very 
mischievous smile Clairwil watches death stiffen Bernole’s limbs 
and drift over his contorted face. 

‘Nothing arouses me like the sight of death,” Clairwil mur- 
murs. And then, her eyes still riveted upon our victim, “Who'd care 
to frig me ?” 

I step forward; Noirceuil slips his stave into my ass, Saint- 
Fond his into Clairwil’s; and we all discharge afresh. After which 
a most delicious meal is brought in and we take places around a 


Juliette & 475. 


table at whose head, as though presiding over the feast, sits the 
corpse. 

“Juliette,” says Saint-Fond, kissing me and laying the money 
down by my plate, “‘here is what I promised you. You will not take 
it amiss if I tell you that until today I allowed myself to harbor 
one or two little doubts as to the stuff you were made of. There is 
no longer any room for them. Your performance was irreproach- 
able.” 

“You will excuse me,” put in Clairwil, “but I am not of that 
opinion. I seem still to notice the same failing in her: whenever 
Juliette commits a crime, it’s enthusiastically; but so long as her 
cunt is dry she might as well be paralyzed. One must proceed 
calmly, deliberately, lucidly. Crime is the torch that should fire the 
passions, that is a commonplace; but I have the suspicion that with 
her it is the reverse, passion firing her to crime.” 

“The difference is enormous,” Saint-Fond remarked, ‘‘for in 
such a case crime is but accessory, whereas it ought to have prime 
importance.” 

“T am afraid I share Clairwil’s view, my dear Juliette,” said 
Noirceuil; “‘you need further encouragement; this ruinous sensibility 
plaguing you must be dealt with. All the irregularities into which 
our imagination leads us,” he continued, “‘are exact indices of our 
degree of intelligence. Its vivacity, its impetuosities, in a superior 
being, are so powerful that it will stop at nothing; obstacles to 
surmount represent that many more delights; and their overcoming 
is not necessarily proof of depravity, as fools suppose, but evidence 
of the mind’s strengthening. You, Juliette, have now reached the 
age where your faculties are at their apogee; you enter your prime 
readied by earnest study, by solid reflection, by a wholesale rejec- 
tion of all the curbs and all the prejudices imposed and acquired in 
childhood. No, you have no cause for worry, that long and careful 
preparation shall not have been for nothing, your career is going 
to be brilliant: a fiery and vigorous temperament, robust health, 
great heat in the bowels, a very chilly heart are there to second 
this ebullient, enlightened, and unscrupulous brain. We may depend 
upon it, my friends, Juliette will go as far as she possibly can; but 
I ask that she not tarry on the wav, nor even pause, that if ever she 
casts a glance backward it be then to chide herself for having made 


476 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


such modest progress, and not to be amazed at the great distances 
she has covered.” 

“I expect still more,” said Clairwil. ‘Let me repeat: I expect 
Juliette to do evil—not to quicken her lust, as I believe it is her 
habit at present, but solely for the pleasure of doing it. I ask that 
in bare evil, evil free ot all lewd accouterments, she find all the 
delight her lust affords her; I ask that she learn to dispense with all 
vehicles, with all pretexts for the doing of evil. This program 
carried out means no diminishing of libertinage’s charms, Juliette 
may go on savoring them as in the past, and ought to. But what I 
am resolutely opposed to is her having to frig herself in order to 
reach a criminal pitch; for the consequences of this kind of be- 
havior are that the day her appetites fade, her desires quit her, 
she'll be incapable of doing anything wrong at all; whereas by 
following my prescriptions, in crime she will always find the means 
to revive her passions. No further need to lay finger to cunt in 
order to perpetrate the wicked deed; but from perpetrating it she 
will derive the wish to frig herself. I find no clearer way of express- 
ing the matter.” 

‘““My dear,” I replied, ‘there is nothing obscure in your phi- 
losophy; I grasp these theories because their practice suits me. Do 
you doubt it? I am prepared to prove it to you; put me to whatever 
test you like. Had you somewhat more carefully observed my 
comportment in the business we have lately dispatched, you would 
not, I am sure, have formulated these criticisms; I am come to the 
stage where I love evil for its own sake; only in crime, I have 
recently noticed, do my passions catch fire, and where the seasoning 
of crime is lacking I taste no joy. There remains a single point I 
would consult you upon. Of remorse I experience nothing anymore, 
I may truthfully declare that for me it has ceased altogether to 
exist, never a twinge of it regardless of the abomination I indulge 
in; but, do you know, I am sometimes ashamed of myself. I blush, 
like Eve abashed after :ating the apple. Our activities, our ex- 
travagances, these are ttings whereof I would not be pleased to 
have intelligence leak out, things I am loath to own save to our 
close friends—why is it so? Why, pray explain to me, why is it that 
of these feelings, remorse and shame, I am susceptible to the 


Juliette & 477 


weaker although impervious to the more potent—in fine, where 
does the distinction lie between the two?” 

“In this,” answered Saint-Fond, “that shame reflects the 
wound inflicted upon public opinion by a given piece of wickedness, 
whereas remorse relates to the pain that wickedness does to our own 
conscience; in such sort that it is possible to be ashamed of a deed 
that causes no remorse when this deed offends conventional practice 
only without afflicting one’s conscience; and similarly it is possible 
to be unashamedly contrite if the deed committed accords with the 
usages and customs of our country, but jars with our conscience. 
For example: to stroll naked down the central alley in the Tuileries 
might well make a man blush, but could hardly make him remorse- 
ful; and a military commander will perhaps feel badly at having 
sent twenty thousand of his troops to their death in a battle, but 
he is not apt to be ashamed. However, both these troublesome feel- 
ings are to be finally eliminated by means of habituation. You now 
belong to the Sodality of the Friends of Crime; it may be safely 
predicted that participation in its activities will by and by rid you 
of your tendency to shame, of your capacity for it: you will acquire 
the habit of a pronounced cynicism, it will make short work of the 
weakness bothering you at present; and to accelerate the cure, I 
urge you to parade your misbehavior, to show yourself nude in 
public, frequently, and to strive after the most arrantly whorish 
effects in your dress; you'll gradually cease to blush at anything; let 
the measures I am advising become seconded by doctrinal firmness, 
and all these sudden starts and annoying twinges will be things of 
the past, you will take a very different view of affairs: you shall 
sense nothing but pleasure there where once upon a time you were 
stricken by shame.” 

More serious matters were broached next: I was informed by 
Saint-Fond that the marriage of his daughter Alexandrine to 
Noirceuil, his friend, was about to be concluded at long last, and 
that he and his future son-in-law were agreed that the young lady 
should pass a season with me, living in my house, where she would 
be familiarized with, and adapted to, the tastes of the individual 
to whom she was going to be joined maritally. 

‘“‘We request you, Noirceuil and I,” Saint-Fond pursued, 
shape this little soul after your own. Cultivate it, nurture it assidu- 


478 = THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ously, make it liberal provision of good counsel and bright example; 
will Noirceuil keep the girl by him if he finds her soundly formed? 
Perhaps. But it is most unlikely he’ll long abide her if she prove 
gauche or a prude. So endeavor, Juliette, to achieve something you 
can be proud of and which will be useful to us all; the pains you 
take will not be overlooked.” 

“Sir,” said I to the Minister, ‘“‘you know that such lessons as 
these can only be given between a pair of sheets. . . .” 

“Of course, of course, my dear,” Saint-Fond nodded. “That 
is what I have in mind.” 

‘By all means, yes,”” Noirceuil echoed. 

“Obviously,” said Clairwil. “How educate a girl save by lying 
with her ?” 

“Quite,” Noirceui] continued; “our good Juliette will bed 
with my wife as often as she sees fit.” 

Saint-Fond took uf fresh subjects; he outlined a cruel scheme 
he had devised for the devastation of France. “We are presently 
concerned,” said he, ‘‘by certain symptoms which could soon lead 
to a revolution in the land, and are disturbed especially by the 
untoward size of the population; the trouble might well have its 
origin there. The more numerous the people become, the greater 
the danger they pose; t1e awakening of minds, the spreading of a 
critical spirit, these are grave developments: only the ignorant 
remain placid under the yoke. Therefore,” the Minister went on, 
‘‘we plan, firstly, to have done with all these grammar schools, the 
free ones, which are producing such alarming quantities of poets, 
painters, and thinkers instead of the drudges and pickpockets we 
ought to have. What need have we of such crowds of talent, why do 
we bother to encourage it in them? Less wit in the nation, I say, and 
some numerical retrenciment also: France requires a severe purg- 
ing, the lowliest is the first sector to attack. We intend hence to 
have unsparingly at mendicants, that’s the class which breeds nine 
out of ten of our agitators; we are razing charitable institutions, 
the poorhouses, being determined not to leave the masses one 
single refuge where insolence can ripen. Bowed beneath chains a 
thousand times heavier than those worn by, let us say, the com- 
moners in Asia, we propose to have ours crawl in slavery, and to 


Juliette %* 479 


this end we are prepared to use the widest variety of radical 
means.” 

“It will be a while before those means take effect,’ Clairwil 
pointed out. “‘If it’s a sudden diminishment you need, then you had 
better resort to prompter ones: war, famine, epidemics. . . .” 

“Ah, war,” said Saint-Fond, ‘we'll not neglect a war, that’s 
scheduled. As for an epidemic, it is to be avoided since we our- 
selves might be its first victims. Regarding a famine, the total 
monopolization of corn we are working toward, as well as being 
profitable to us, will shortly reduce the people to veritable cannibal- 
ism. We are counting heavily upon this measure. The Council of 
Ministers approved it unanimously today. Speedy, infallible, prodi- 
giously lucrative. 

‘Won over to the principles Machiavelli set so clearly forth,” 
the Minister continued, “I have for a long time had the profound 
conviction that individuals can be of no account to the politician; 
as machines, men must labor for the prosperity of the government 
they are subordinated to, never should the government be con- 
cerned for the welfare of the public. Every government that inter- 
ests itself in the governed is weak; there is but one sort of strong 
government, and it considers itself everything and the nation noth- 
ing. Whether there are a few more or a few less slaves in a State 
does not matter; what does, is that their bondage weigh onerously 
and absolutely upon a people, and that the sovereign be despotic. 
Rome tottered feebly along in the days when Romans insisted upon 
governing themselves; but she became mistress of the world when 
tyrants seized authority; all the power resides in the sovereign, 
thus must we behold the thing, and since this power is merely moral 
so long as the people are physically the stronger, only by an unin- 
terrupted series of despotic actions can the government assemble 
the force it needs: until such time as it commands all the real power, 
it will exist in an ideal sense only. When we are eager to gain the 
upper hand over others, we must little by little accustom them to 
seeing in us something which is actually not there; otherwise, they'll 
only see us for what we are, and this will regularly and inevitably 
be to our detriment... .” 

“It has always seemed to me,” Clairwil remarked, “that the 


480 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


art of governing men is the one that demands more. trickery, more 
duplicity, and more fraudulence than any other.” 

“Perfectly true,” Saint-Fond assented, “and the reason there- 
for is simple: there is no governing human beings unless you deceive 
them. To deceive them, you must be false. The enlightened man will 
never allow himself to be led about by the end of his nose, hence you 
must deprive him of light, keep him in darkness if you would steer 
him; none of this is possible without duplicity.” 

‘But is not duplicity a vice?” I wondered. 

“IT would rather tend to esteem it a virtue,’’ answered the 
Minister, “it is the only key untocking the human heart. You cannot 
hope to live amidst men if you limit yourself to honesty; their sole 
and constant effort being to deceive us, what awaits us if we do not 
very quickly learn to deceive them? The foremost preoccupation of 
man and of the statesman, particularly, is to penetrate others with- 
out letting his own thoughts be known. Well, if duplicity is the 
only means for achieving this, duplicity is then a virtue; in a totally 
corrupt world there is never any danger being more rotten than 
one’s neighbors; rather, "tis there to assure oneself of the whole 
sum of felicity and ease which virtue would procure us in a moral 
society. But the mechanism that directs government cannot be 
virtuous, because it is impossible to thwart every crime, to protect 
oneself from every criminal without being criminal too; that which 
directs corrupt mankind must be corrupt itself; and it will never be 
by means of virtue, virtue being inert and passive, that you will 
maintain control over vice, which is ever active: the governor must 
be more energetic thar the governed: well, if the energy of the 
governed simply amounts to so many crimes threatening to be 
unleashed, how can yo. expect the energy of the governor to be 
anything different? what are legally prescribed punishments if not 
crimes? and what excuses them? the necessity of governing men. 
There it is: crime is one of the vital mainsprings of government, | 
ask you now in what sense can this they call virtue be necessary in 
the world, when it is evident you cannot obtain it save through 
crimes? I may add that it is exceedingly necessary, for the govern- 
ment itself, that mankind in general be thoroughly corrupt: the 
more corrupt men are, the more easily they may be managed. In 


Juliette & 481 


conclusion, examine virtue from every viewpoint and you always 
find it useless and dangerous. 

“Juliette,” Saint-Fond declared, addressing himself now to 
me, “if you still entertain prejudices touching this subject, I should 
like to rid you of them once and for all, they cannot have anything 
but the worst influence upon your destiny. Opinions are important 
in life, I should like to make certain that yours are wholesome; for 
it is dreadful, if one is born with penchants for evil-doing, not to be 
able to do evil save in fear and trembling. Hear me, my angel, take 
note of what I say: were your activities to hurl the entire natural 
order into confusion, you would be doing no more than exercising 
the faculties Nature gave you for that—faculties which Nature was 
perfectly aware you would employ for that; their employment is 
obviously not something Nature can object to or condemn, since 
instead of neutralizing these harmful faculties she originally gave 
you, or subsequently depriving you of them, she does nought but 
incite in you, continually, the desire to make the most of them. So 
do all the evil you like, and do it knowing it need not cost you a 
wink of sleep; take heart in the fact that whatever the species of 
wickedness you contrive, for violence it will never surpass or satisfy 
Nature’s greedy expectations, who welcomes destruction, loves it, 
lusts after it, feeds upon it; take heart, I say, knowing that you 
please Nature never so well as when, emulating her, you set your 
hand to ruinous work; and knowing that. if the question be of 
outrage, of infringement upon her rights, you never so injure her 
as when you labor at the creation she abhors, or as when you leave 
in peace this mass of humanity which is an eternal threat to her; for 
the true laws of Nature are crime and death, and we are most 
faithfully her servants when, smiting hard to left and right, in a 
rage like hers we indiscriminately cut down all inside our reach.” 

‘Believe me, Saint-Fond,” I replied to my lover, “‘to all the 
principles you have just settled I adhere most cordially. Only one 
thing disturbs me: one must, you asserted, be treacherous in one’s 
dealings with everybody; now, if by ill chance you were so with 
me—”’ 

‘You need dread no such eventuality,” the Minister afirmed 
at once. “I shall never be treacherous toward my friends, if merely 
because one cannot very well do without something solid and sure 


482 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


in the world; and what’s left if you cannot count upon your inter- 
course with your friends? You may therefore be certain, all three 
of you, that I shall never play you false unless you wrong me 
first. The reason is simple. I base it on self-interest, the only rule 
I know for judging oneself and others intelligently. We live side by 
side: is it not true that if you discover I am deceiving you, you will 
deceive me in return at the first opportunity; and I do not want 
to be deceived: there’s tre whole of my logic upon the chapter of 
friendship. Experience shows that between persons of the same sex 
the sentiment of friendship is not easy to preserve, and impossible 
between persons of unlike sex; I value it in so far as it may be 
founded upon likenesses of humor and compatibilities of taste, 
which happens only very seldom; but it is a great error to suppose 
virtue must be its cemert; if that were so, friendship would be- 
come an unbearably dul. sentiment which monotony would soon 
destroy. When pleasures provide its basis, each new idea gives 
the attachment an added sinew; need, the sole real aliment of 
friendship, knits it ever tighter, affection grows with each passing 
day as with each passing day increases the mutual need of one 
for the other; you have enjoyment from your friend, you enjoy 
yourselves together, you enjoy yourself for his sake, each delight 
fortifies the rest, and ’tis only then one may be said to know them. 
But what does a virtuous sentiment yield me? A few barren pleas- 
ures, a few vapid intellectual gratifications that never survive the 
first test, except in the form of regrets which are the more poignant 
where hurt has been clone one’s pride, no shafts being more 
wounding than those which strike there.” 

It was past midnight; we retired, the four of us repairing to a 
bed eight feet long and eight wide, built for such scenes; and after 
some lewd ones, some foul ones, we went to sleep. Noirceuil had 
business awaiting him in the city and left us early the next day; 
Clairwil remained with me to keep Saint-Fond company, for the 
Minister was disposed to spend a few more days in the country. 

Upon our return to Paris Saint-Fond brought me his daughter, 
whose apartment had been put in readiness during our absence. 
Alexandrine was of an extraordinary and eminently regular beauty; 
she could boast of a sub'ime bust, the prettiest details distinguished 
her form, her skin was glowing clear, her flesh firm, there was 


Juliette & 483 


grace and ripeness in her limbs, heaven shone in her face, her 
organ well became the rest, it positively intrigued, and thete was 
considerable of the romantic in her spirit. 

“Here is my. daughter,” said Saint-Fond, introducing her to 

e, “I mean, as you know, to marry her to Noirceuil, who is not 
the man to be rattled by the liberties I have taken with her and 
which J still take every day. There’s some fruit left on the tree, 
however: frontwardly, Alexandrine has treasures still to be as- 
sessed. But on the hinder side . . . her ass, this gorgeous ass, 
Juliette, has been long the object of my depradations. Who could 
have resisted such a temptation? Look at it, my angel, and tell 
me now, have you ever seen anything so inviting in all your life?” 

Rarely indeed had I clapped eyes on a fairer, a better-cleft 
set of buttocks. 

“And for endurance, for elasticity, and for healing power it 
is perfectly remarkable,” Saint-Fond went on, opening it wide, 
“for from the look of it who would believe I lash her every morning 
at nine and bum-fuck her every night at ten? I confide this girl 
to you, Juliette, educate her for a while; make her worthy of the 
gentleman whose wife she shall be, breed in her the taste for all 
crimes and the liveliest horror for all virtues. To you I cede my 
rights over her; transmit to her the philosophical systems you have 
received from him who is to wed her; give her all our penchants, 
communicate all our passions to her: never has the name of God 
been pronounced within her hearing, I think I may safely expect 
it shan’t be in your proximity that religious notions will occur to 
her. I’d not trifle with her, no, I’d put a bullet in the chit’s brain 
the instant I detected talk of that execrable chimera coming out 
of her mouth. For several important reasons neither Noirceuil 
nor I can personally undertake the task we are entrusting to you; 
but Alexandrine could not be left in more capable hands.” 

That was the occasion on which the Minister mentioned the 
news of Noirceuil’s nomination to one of the highest posts at the 
Court, which fetched with it one hundred thousand crowns a year. 
“It was given him,” Saint-Fond added, “at the same time the 
King conferred upon me another worth twice as much.” 

And while vice, impudent vice, sped unerringly from one 
triumph to the next, fate went just as steadily crushing whomever 


484 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


those mighty rascals deigned to make victims. Such was the situ- 
ation; I pondered it at length. And all my observations, all my 
meditations conspired to depress ever lower the view I held of 
goodness, and to exalt my opinion of evil, again and again con- 
firming me in my choice to dwell fast and secure in the bosom of 
crime and of infamy. . . Ah, my friends, I cannot well com- 
municate to you the loathing I had of virtue. 

I spent the following night with Alexandrine; no question 
abaut it, that child was delicious. But I must nonetheless own that 
I beheld her so philosophically, sobriety to such a degree character- 
izing my senses, that it is difficult to give an account of the pleasures 
she yielded me: she rous:d my emotions scarcely at all. My ideas 
had gained such a prise apon me, the moral in me so thoroughly 
overmastered the physical, my indifference was such, my self- 
possession so unshakable, that whether it was because of surfeit, 
or depravity, or sheer pigheadedness, I was able to have her 
naked ten successive hour's in my bed, to frig her, to have her frig 
me, to lick her, to suck her, and all that unremittingly and without 
a trace of feeling. Here, I dare say, is an outstanding example of 
the benefits that accrue from stoicism. Steeling our soul against 
all that may stir it, by means of libertinage inuring it to crime, 
paring voluptuousness down to a purely carnal affair and stub- 
bornly denying it any zlement of delicacy, the stoical training 
enervates the soul; and srom this state, wherein its native activity 
does not permit it to remain long, it passes into one of apathy 
which soon metamorphoses into pleasures a thousand times diviner 
than those which frailties could procure it; for the fuck I shed with 
Alexandrine, though due to this toughness I have sought to repre- 
sent, got me delights infinitely more trenchant than the ones which 
would have resulted from excitement or the dreary heats of love. 

At any rate, to my consideration Alexandrine appeared quite 
as untaught morally as she was physically inexperienced; every- 
thing was still to be doxe for her heart and her mind. The little 
vixen had a promising disposition, however, and every time I 
attempted to arouse her I found her full of fuck. I asked her, did 
her father hurt her when he buggered her? 

“A great deal at first,” she admitted, but she had become 
so used to it that it no longer caused her suffering. 


Juliette & 485 


Upon my demanding whether she had held conversation with 
anyone beside the Minister and Noirceuil, she told me Saint-Fond 
had obliged her to accept the attentions of one other man, and 
from her description I recognized Delcour. ‘‘Attentions,” I re- 
peated; “do you mean by that he embuggered you too?” No, he 
had whipped her while her father looked on; judge thereby of the 
imagination of a man whose prick lifts and spits as he watches 
his daughter being flogged by a public executioner. In the course 
of our first night together I supplied my pupil all the rudiments 
of the theory of libertinage; and in three days’ time she was 
frigging me as adroitly as Clairwil. Be that as it may, this child 
gradually began to set my teeth on edge; I was already caressing 
visions of her undoing when I asked Noirceuil his intentions con- 
cerning the creature. 

“I shall make a victim of her, needless to say. I’ve never 
done anything else with a wife.” 

“Then why the delay ?” 

He smiled. ‘Because of the dowry, because of the child I 
want to sire on her, or have somebody else sire, because of my 
desire to preserve the Minister’s protection through this alliance.” 

These were considerations which had not occurred to me; I 
had to abandon my plans. I simultaneously lost all interest in 
Alexandrine and, in order not to have to mention her again— 
I have more important things to talk about—let me say that she 
married Noirceuil, became pregnant one way or another; and the 
moral instruction I gave her having penetrated not very far, it was 
early on in the game that she succumbed to the concerted villainy 
of her father and husband, perishing during a rout I did not 
attend because of events whose details I shall enter into shortly. 

The girls whom I furnished to the Minister did not always 
cost me as much as I retailed them for, and it sometimes even 
happened that I edrned money through their acquisition. I shall 
cite an instance of this, realizing that it does not. speak in favor 
of my probity. 

From a personage residing in the provinces I one day receive 
a letter, telling me that the government owes him half a million 
francs which he loaned the State during the last war; his affairs 
have taken a catastrophic turn, for want of the sum aforemen- 


486 <> THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tioned he has been brought to the worst extremes, he is faced by 
nothing short of starvation, he and his sixteen-year-old daughter, 
who, devoted to her as he is, he would marry with a part of the 
money if he could but recover his due. Knowing of my influence 
with the Minister he has been obliged to invoke my aid; all 
pertinent documents accompany his missive. I make inquiry, learn 
that what he advances is true; obtaining the funds will require 
intercession from a powerful source, but that they are owing to 
the claimant is beyond all question. Moreover, the young lady 
referred to in the letter is, so I am assured, one of the most 
enchanting creatures in the entire country. Without airing anything 
of my scheme to the Minister, I ask him for the necessary order 
for payment. It is delivered to me at once; in twenty-four hours I 
accomplish what ten years of struggle have failed to get the pro- 
vincial. As soon as I have the cash in hand, I notify the latter that 
appropriate steps have been taken; but that his presence is indis- 
pensable; that success could only be accelerated by his arrival 
in the disbursor’s office accompanied by a pretty young thing; in 
fine, I urge him to bring his daughter to town with him. The 
simpleton is taken roundly in; he appears at my door and with 
him, sure enough, he has one of the loveliest girls it has ever been 
my fortune to see. I loclged them in a place of safety, but did 
not keep them long in doubt of their fate: they were the principal 
ornaments at the next cf the frolics I arranged each week for 
Saint-Fond. Already five hundred thousand francs in pocket and 
thanks to this newest piece of treachery now in the possession of 
the father and daughter. you will not, I suppose, be hard put to 
guess what employment I reserved for these spoils. The money, 
enough to have guaranteed a comfortable future to several families, 
was squandered by me in less than a week; the daughter, who might 
surely have made, had fate been kinder, for the felicity of some 
honest man, instead of that, after having been soiled by our 
nocturnal pollutions for three days in a row, made a fourth supper 
victim, her father providing a fifth, both expiring under a torture 
the more barbarous for being prolonged over twelve hours of 
hideous suffering. 

To complete this self-portrait, after describing my perfidy I 
ought to represent my greed to you. With me greed went far: to 


Juliette & 487 


the point, indeed, of usury. Once finding myself with eight hun- 
dred thousand francs worth of objects in pledge, objects which 
would not, had I auctioned them off, have fetched a fourth of that 
sum, I declared bankruptcy, and the gesture sufficed to ruin twenty 
humble families who had deposited into my keeping all they had 
of value in exchange for a pitiful fugitive subsistence, no more 
than enough to enable them to pursue the desperate toiling whence 
they earned practically nothing. 


Eastertide was drawing near, Clairwil reminded me of our 
appointment at the Carmelites. There we betook ourselves, 
Elvire and Charmeil, the two prettiest of my hired sluts, in tow. 
No sooner were we inside the monastery than the Superior asked 
for news of Claude. Nothing further had been heard from him 
since he had left after accepting our invitation. In reply, we won- 
dered whether in the absence of other information it might not 
be conjectured that, libertine as he decidedly was, he had flung 
away his frock. No more was said of Claude. We entered a vast 
hall; and it was there the Superior had us review his legions. 
Eusebius, so was the head of the establishment called, summoned 
them forward from ranks one by one; they stepped forth, were 
taken in charge by my two women who frigged them and displayed 
their pricks when they were in fullest flower. Anything short of six 
inches around by nine in length was rejected, so was anything older 
than fifty. We had been promised only thirty opponents, here in 
fact were fifty-four friars plus ten novices with engines not one 
inferior to the dimensions noted above, and certain of them ten 
by fourteen. The ceremony began. 

It transpired in that same hall. Clairwil and I were bidden 
to recline upon broad couches, thick-mattressed and elastic, our 
legs flexed, our loins pillowed on big cushions, totally naked; in 
this first assault, we gave the cunt for target to the adversary. Our 
tribades sorted out the pricks according to size and directed them 
our way, starting with the smaller; from now on all pollution was 
effected by us, that is to say, we each readied the pair of pricks 
which were to succeed the ones encunting us at the moment. When 
a cunt became filled by what had been in a hand, that empty hand 


488 <%& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


was immediately given a new prick to prepare; we each had, at all 
times, three men either on or by us. After he had completed his 
attack, a friar would retire from the field and into an adjoining 
room, there to rest and await further orders. They were all naked, 
their pricks were all sheathed, and it was into those protectors 
they all discharged. First they visited Clairwil, then me; and so 
were we each fucked four and sixty times in the course of this 
engagement, toward the close of which our women went into the 
other room and busied themselves preparing the friars for fresh 
affray. The second attack began. . . . Another sixty-four fuckings 
apiece; it was under identical circumstances the third was launched, 
except that it was directed at our asses and we, instead of frigging 
pricks manually, constantly had one in our mouths: a prick that 
had just emerged from our asses we sucked, furbishing it for the 
fourth attack. Here, we introduced the weaving variation: that is, 
I sucked the prick which withdrew from Clairwil’s bum and she 
mouthed the one that czme out of mine. When truce was called 
we had each been fucked one hundred twenty-eight times cuntwardly 
and as many times in the ass, making two hundred fifty-six fuckings 
in all. Biscuits and sherry were served, then battle was resumed. 

We took on our men in groups of eight: we had a prick 
underneath each armpit, one in each hand, one between the bubs, 
another in the mouth, the seventh in the cunt, the eighth in the 
bowels. No sheaths now; the object was to lave, bathe our bodies 
in sperm from head to toe and to have fuck spouting from all 
sides at once. Each eight-man platoon loosed two volleys, bringing 
first one of us, then the other, under fire, and the constituents of 
each changed posts; thus it was we each underwent eight such 
assaults, and when they were over we declared ourselves satisfied 
and at our hosts’ disposal; they might do what they wished with 
either of us and to their hearts’ content. So it was that Clairwil was 
fucked another fifteen times in the mouth, ten in the cunt, and 
thirty-nine in the ass; and I forty-six in the ass, eight in the mouth, 
and ten in the cunt.® All told, another two hundred fuckings each. 


9 In such sort that these two winning creatures, not counting oral incursions—for 
mouth-fucking produces upon the fucked too faint an impression to merit consideration 
here—had, at this stage, been fucked, Clairwil one hundred and eighty-five times 
and Juliette one hundrd and ninety-two, this both cuntwise and asswardly. We have

The sun rose and as it was Easter day, the rascals who had 
treated us thus marched off to Mass and then marched back; the 
hour for dinner being*not far off, we indicated to the Superior 
our desire to proceed to the little impieties that had been included 
in our agreement, before sitting down to the noon meal. Eusebius, 
who cared for men only, had, during our lubricious antics, con- 
fined himself to readying pricks and embuggering a few of his 
brothers while they were fucking us. 

‘“‘Why certainly,” he assured us, “I shall myself celebrate the 
Holy Mystery in the chapel of the Virgin. Have you any prefer- 
ences touching how it should be done?” 

“As follows,” said Clairwil. ‘“‘A second friar will officiate 
beside you: these two Masses will be said upon the cunts of our 
two tribades; while this is going on yet another friar will be mouth- 
fucking them, this enabling him to present his ass to the celebrant 
and at the point the Host is consecrated he will drop a mard upon 
the girl’s belly, and the priest will promptly insert the wafer in 
the mard; my friend and I shall come forth to seek God therein, 
we'll apply fire to some of it, stab it elsewhere with the point of ‘a 
knife; what remains of the mixture shall be divided into four 
portions, two of these are to be buried in the asses of the celebrants, 
rammed home by prodding pricks, and the third and fourth por- 
tions will be likewise stored in Juliette’s ass and in mine: four little 
syringes—we have them here—shall have been got ready in the 
meantime, and the holy wine shall now be squirted into our funda- 
ments. Next, we two women and the two priests shall be sodomized 
anew, and to what is already in our asses discharged fuck shall 
be added. Your prettiest and best crucifixes will be beneath our 
bellies throughout the operation, and we shall shit thereupon, 
as well as into your chalices and various sacred vessels, immediately 
after we have been fucked.” 

All passed in conformance to my friend’s wishes.

She came away from the rites very satisfied. “Excellent, ex- 
cellent,” she repeated, ‘‘so much silliness, doubtless, and quite 
useless, but I found it stimulating and that is sufficient justification 
for anything. Voluptuous delights are no more than what the 
imagination makes of them; and that which pleaseth best will 
always be the most delectable: 


All tastes partake of Nature; 
The best is that which one has.” 


We shared a magnificent repast with Eusebius and four of 
the friars whose performances had been most noteworthy; we 
rested for two hours, and the orgies recommenced. 

Our two tribades were stationed on either side of Clairwil, 
one displayed her cunt, tre other her ass; my task was to erect the 
sixty-four pricks and to lodge them one after the other, first in 
my companion’s vagina, then in her anus, she awaiting them lying 
on her back, her legs raised, her ankles being afhxed to the posts at 
the foot of the bed; her swains did no more than excite themselves 
in her cunt, all discharging occurred in her ass. I took Clairwil’s 
place, she now rendered me the same service. By dint of such 
arrangements, those libertines not only obtained the pleasure of 
fucking us bilaterally, but in addition to that obtained, while 
fucking, the pleasure of being aided, assisted, guided by a pretty 
hand, and of kissing a mouth, a cunt, or an asshole at will; fuck 
flowed in tides. 

At the second sitting while each of our tribades was rubbing 
a prick on our faces we were frigging another in each hand, and 
two ecclesiastics were tonguing us: we were in a crouching position, 
squarely above the nose of the man who was licking our asshole; 
between our legs, knee.ing there, was he who was sucking our 
cunt; the seventh and eighth stood by, prick in hand, awaiting 
instructions, and they would encunt or embugger us when, properly 
aroused by the sucker or the licker, we gave the signal for intro- 
duction. An hour or so of this and our total number of fuckings 
had risen by eight more. 

Overtaxed, our spirits were beginning to flag when into 
Clairwil’s head popped the thought that revived us both. She 
expressed it thus: ‘With a little skill, it is possible for two men to 


Juliette @ 491 


encunt a woman at the same time; let those approach who are still 
in condition to try it.” Several came forward, my friend designated 
two of them. “You,” said she tc the better-weaponed, “you'll lie 
down and I shall get aboard you and take your prick first. And 
you,” she said to his fellow, “you'll fuck me from behind, frigging 
my asshole while you do. I can perfectly well suck a third man’s 
prick; and what’s to prevent me from frigging two others?” 

Not every cunt is made for the success of such an enterprise; 
Clairwil’s, happily, was by no means narrow. Pounded and scraped 
by two gigantic members, their action coordinated in such a manner 
that while the one slid aft the other crashed forward till hair met 
hair,” thus fucked at a sustained allegro for the space of three 
hours and better by the twenty-six friars who were agile enough 
to accomplish the trick, the whore, at the end of it all, was in a 
frantic condition; her glaring eyes roved, sparks shot from them, 
foam whitened her lips, she was in a lather; and spent as she looked 
to be, yet she would have more; like one possessed she darted hither 
and thither through the press, clutching at pricks, sucking upon 
them, pulling them, essaying this and that to stiffen them to new 
efforts. Too young, too delicate, to permit myself even to attempt 
the obscene irregularity my companion was engaged in, I enter- 
tained myself at preparing the pricks required for her feast; but 
more than this I could not do. In both the zones of pleasure there 
was such a burning sensation, a scorching so intense, that I was 
scarce able to sit down. 

We supped. It was late. Clairwil said she would fain lie that 
night in the convent. 

“Kindly have a mattress placed for me upon the altar in your 
church,” said she to the Superior, “‘there’s yet a deal of fucking to 
be done. Juliette will join me. The weather is warm, we shall be 
more comfortable there. Or, if she prefers, Juliette may lie in

that the woman well enough constituted to make trial of this method will ex- 
tract therefrom sensations so highly flavored, vibrations so compelling that it is not 
easily practiced without loss of consciousness; if she can secure the collaboration of 
a third man capable of address enough to embugger her in the meantime, she will 
then be sure of tasting the most violent pleasure that can possibly be procured by our 
sex.” (From a note communicated by a lady of thirty years, who elsewhere declares 
having enjoyed this experience upon better than one hundred separate occasions.)

the chapel dedicated to the whore who, they say, begot the hanged 
God of your infamous Christianity. What say you, Juliette? Go 
sprawl yourself upon that altar, there’s my suggestion, spread 
your legs in pious remembrance of the whorishness of Dirty 
Mary. Instead of soldiers from the Jerusalem garrison by whom 
the buggeress would get herself stuffed every day, from amongst 
our Carmelite army you'll select those in whom you suspect a 
little lingering vigor.” 

“But I can fuck no rrore,” I protested. 

“Nonsense. You'll frig them, they’ll frig you; you’ll suck them, 
they'll suck you. You'll sce. One can always scrape up fuck to shed 
in foul circumstances. You tell me you are spent? Not I. Far 
from it; I’ve been well tupped today, better than you, and I am 
still ablaze. The floods of sperm that washed into my ass and 
cunt put no flames out, but fed them. I am on fire... . The more 
one fucks, my dearest, the more one wants to fuck; only fuck 
soothes the inflammation fucking causes; and when a woman has 
a temperament like the ane Nature gave me, only from fucking, 
only while fucking, can ste be happy. Woman has one innate virtue, 
it is whorishness; to fuck, that and that alone is what we were 
created for; woe unto her whom a thoughtless and stupid vir- 
tuousness ever keeps prisoner of dull prejudices; a victim of her 
opinions and of the chilly esteem she hopes for, almost always in 
vain, from men, she'll have lived dry and joyless and shall die 
unregretted. Libertinage in women used once to be venerated the 
world over; it had worshipers everywhere, temples even; I become 
more and more a zealot in that cause. "Tis my creed, my whole 
concern and ambition; so long as there is breath in me, I[ shall be 
a whore, I proclaim it, I swear it. If there is anyone who can claim 
gratitude from me, it belongs to those who encouraged me in the 
way of vice. To them ] owe everything, I owe life itself. That 
which I received from ny parents was besmirched by infamous 
prejudices, they comprised a very jail; I burst out of it, my passions 
broke down those walls, cindered those prejudices, and since the 
daylight my eyes behold only became pure the day I learned the 
art of fucking, I consider that my existence dates from then. . . 
Pricks, aye, pricks, those are my gods, those are my kin, my boon 
companions, unto me they are everything, I live in the name of

nothing but the penis sublime; and when it is not in my cunt, nor 
in my ass, it is so firmly anchored in my thoughts that the day they 
dissect me it will be found in my brain.” 

After this exuberant statement, delivered somewhat more in- 
coherently than I reproduce it here and in a voice bordering upon 
a shriek, Clairwil laid hold of two Carmelites and dashed away to 
wrestle with them upon the altar; I repaired to the chapel. Having 
first sponged myself with rose water, I provoked attacks from the 
two superb novices I had chosen, and I was in the throes of new 
transports when Clairwil reappeared, crying that she was in re- 
quirement of fresh men. 

“It is all very well—and natural enough—to pick and choose 
amidst abundance, but provisions are now run out, these buggers 
are frayed and bone-dry. Can you believe it, Juliette, I have just 
been flubbed—aye, flubbed, I who never before had to endure that 
affront. Up, my lass, there are other pricks in this convent; we 
merely requisitioned the cream of the crop, let’s feel out the rest. 
If the Superior,” she went on, bidding someone go in search of him, 
“if the Superior has made no individual contribution to the satis- 
fying of my desires, he shall yet prove himself useful in having 
them appeased by those of his underlings who, hale in wind and 
limb and having not yet lifted weapon, ought to have fight enough 
in them to content us. Ah, Eusebius, there you are,” she said when 
he arrived, ‘‘good Eusebius, take us to the cells inhabited by the 
friars who were excused from duty but of whom we are in need at 
present; lead on.” 

We wended our way slowly through the cloister; doors opened 
at our summons; and whatever the conformation of those we un- 
covered in those chambers, they were enjoined to tup us. All sub- 
scribed to the bargain, all signed it in sperm: some had at us from 
the front, and others, they were the majority, would take us nowise 
but from behind; and we, with a single aim in view, that of being 
fucked, we wasted no time higgling or disputing, but lent ourselves 
on the spot to this usage or to that, glad simply to obtain fuck in 
no matter what orifice: such is the attitude every woman should 
adopt. Is there anything more absurd, indeed, than to fancy that 
there is only one part of the body for the reception of pricks, and 
that if perchance one strays off the beaten track crimes at once

start to be committed ? as if, in shaping us two-holed, Nature had 
not indicated to man to stopper them both, indiscriminately; and 
that with a predilection for the one or the other, let him but proceed 
as he likes, he acts within the laws of a mother far too wise to have 
conferred upon one of her feeblest creatures the empty little privi- 
lege of outraging her. 

Very partisan to this manner of fucking, considering it beyond 
comparison with the other, I was gratified to have no one, during 
this second round, ask yor anything but my ass, and I made it 
available to all comers. 

At length we reached the elder recluses. 

“Nothing must be reglected, no exceptions granted,” Clairwil 
said, ‘‘no man is without merit once he can be got to discharge; 
fuck is all I expect of any of them.” 

Several who were lying abed with novices bent cold glances 
in our direction. “You've nothing to offer us that would recompense 
infidelity on our part,” trey told us; “even were you to avail us of 
the shrine wherein we perform our customary sacrifices, there 
would yet be that other altar whose mere presence nearby is sufh- 
cient to defeat any attempt at homage: 


Contrive what she will, however she turn, 
A womun can be nought but a woman. 


—Martial, Epig.” 


From others we hed friendlier greeting; but to what trouble 
we had to go only to stif'en their antique instruments! to what were 
we not obliged to consent! what ministrations, what lewd atten- 
tions! how many different roles did we have to play! Now victims, 
now priestesses, we had. by means of cruel macerations, to resusci- 
tate a well-nigh extinct Nature in some, whereas others could not 
be brought out of their lethargy until we submitted ourselves to be 
molested by them. One of these old sinners must flog us, we gave 
him leave; we lashed others; we had to lend our mouths to five or 
six; and very scurvily they repaid our industry, spending their 
strength before we could obtain the least benefit from it; yet others 
demanded more unusual treatment; we complied in every instance 
... and they all discharged, down to the sexton, to the gate-keeper, 
to the pew-sweepers who fucked us unendingly, attaining staggering

s 


totals; and after having been a good three hundred times mounted 
in one way or another by all manner of riders, we took our de- 
parture, smitten by every sort of fatigue that can whelm the human 
frame. Nine days of moderate living, including lots of baths and 
whey, restored us so wonderfully to rights that you’d never have 
guessed the Carmelites had served us anything stronger than tea. 

But while no outward marks of that party were left on me, 
it had fired my imagination; my mental state was something that 
defies description, I was enwrapped in an unabating delirium of 
lubricity; to find relief or, if not that, to arouse myself further, I 
decided to go alone for once to a foregathering of our Sodality: 
there are moments when, however agreeable the company of a 
person like in mind to ourselves, we nevertheless prefer solitude, 
thinking, perhaps, that we will be freer, that our fancy will enjoy 
a wider scope; for when alone one is dispensed of that kind of 
shame or bashfulness so hard to be rid of when with others; and 
there is, after all, no equivalent to solitary crimes. 

It had beeen some while since I had appeared in those circles: 
constantly surrounded by pleasures, I often did not know how to 
choose among them. No sooner did I enter than I was beset by 
suitors and paid a thousand compliments; and it became quite 
clear that though I might have come there animated by ferocious 
intentions, the part I was going to have to enact was not the 
sacrificer’s, but the victim’s. A man in his early forties encunted me; 
to his ardors I responded with that minimum of interest courtesy 
demands; I remained very listless until my glance lit upon an ex- 
tremely handsome abbot who at the time was alternately embugger- 
ing two young ladies while having himself fucked. He was scarce a 
yard away; I ventured a few smutty comments, I noticed that they 
excited him, and that he was now devoting a good deal more at- 
tention to me than to the material he was using. Hastily disen- 
cumbering ourselves of our several entourages, we joined each 
other. 

‘Your style of fucking is far more to my liking | than the one 
you saw me subjected to a moment ago,” said I; “it surpasses 
my understanding how a man fit to belong to this Sodality durst 
continue to dally with a cunt.” 

“TI too am puzzled by the thing,” Chabert admitted. 


496 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


(For it was Chabert, my friends, the very same who today is 
the fairest ornament in our little rural society, and whom you shall 
soon see playing a role in my adventures.) 

“That is to say,” mv engaging abbot went on, “‘this prick you 
see here, and you see it yet in goodly size and fettle, is of the 
variety that tickles more in ass than in cunt.” 

“Tm sure of it,” I replied. 

“In which case,” said he, taking me by the hand and beckon- 
ing his late fucker to follow, “let us remove to a boudoir, and I'll 
show you to what a degre our tastes are alike.” 

We established ourselves; Chabert’s fucker was furnished 
like a mule: the Abbot himself was very respectfully outfitted; my 
ass drained their four balls dry. I promised Chabert we would 
meet again, and stole off to the seraglios where, thanks to the 
stimulants I had just absorbed, I arrived in a fury. After treating 
myself to three hours of ass-fucking I went from the male slaves’ 
quarters to the females’, in search of victims. Recollecting those 
pits dug between the two walls, and in whose depths one had the 
feeling of being in the remotest place on earth, I selected a pair 
of little girls, one aged five, the other six, and off we went. I had 
a marvelous time: there where we were, you might scream, you 
might rave, you might shout your lungs away, dwellers in the anti- 
podes would sooner have heard you than the inhabitants of our 
hemisphere; and after such horrors as you may prefer to surmise 
rather than have me pant for you, I alone climbed up flights of 
stairs three human beings had descended not long before. 

It was soon afterward that I dined at the home of Noirceuil. 
His other guest, a striking figure of a man, was identified to me as 
Comte de Belmor. 

“Here is our new president,” said Noirceuil. ““The Comte 
assumes office today, and for his inaugural address he has promised 
us a discourse on love. Unless I am mistaken it will contain much to 
forearm the feminine heart against a sentiment which women only 
too often have the extravagance to conceive for men. And you, my 
friend,” he continued, turning to Belmor, ‘allow me to introduce 
the famous Juliette to you. Have you met at the Sodality ?” 

“No,” said the Comte, “I do not believe I recall having seen 
Madame—” 


Juliette & 497 


‘Never mind,” said Noirceuil, “you'll have become acquainted 
with her before you Jeave. . . . Here is the fairest ass . . . and the 
blackest soul—a personage of our own stripe, Comte. She shall 
be there to listen to you this afternoon; would you care to do any- 
thing before we dine? I am expecting Clairwil but, you know, it will 
be four o’clock ere she has completed her toilette. Since it is only 
three now, let me exhort you to step briefly into my boudoir, my 
valet will be at your orders.” 

Belmor consented; the valet arrived, and we all three en- 
closeted ourselves. Belmor’s passion was simple: he kissed, he 
lengthily, pensively brooded over a woman’s buttocks while receiv- 
ing a sodomization from the man; then, when this man had dis- 
charged, he re-stiffened the man’s prick by rubbing it upon the 
woman’s ass, got from him a second ejaculation which with great 
care he guided so that it landed exactly in the hole, and devoured 
what the man had just loosed, the woman farting meanwhile. He 
was then flogged. The Comte now rehearsed each scene in the 
drama, but feeling that he would have to face heavy obligations 
later onin the day, refrained from discharging; we quit the boudoir. 
A perfectly heavenly Clairwil had just appeared; we took ourselves 
to table. 

“Juliette,” Noirceuil said to me, “you must not think that 
the Comte’s practices are limited to the mild little ritual you and he 
have just executed. You are our friend, this he knew. He behaved 
with the appropriate consideration.” 

‘‘He is capable of singular self-restraint,” Clairwil put in. 

“Are you then familiar, Madame,” I asked, smiling, ‘with 
what Monsieur does when carried away? Do not leave me in 
ignorance, I beg of you; for I would fain be privy to everything con- 
cerning such an amiable gentleman.” 

“Comte,” Noirceuil asked, ‘do you deem it fitting she be 
told?” 

‘Ts it truly advisable? Such information must surely give 
Madame an unfavorable impression of my character.” 

‘“‘Reassure yourself,” said Clairwil. “My friend is apt to 
esteem you above all for the multiplicity and superlativeness of 
your vices.” 

‘This scoundrel’s favorite caprice,” said Noirceuil,

have a little boy of five or six bound to the shoulders of a beautiful 
woman; a knife is taken to the tender victim, innumerable gashes 
are so inflicted as to cause the flowing of blood to collect and run 
in a single rivulet down between the buttocks and over the asshole 
of the woman, who is obliged to shit during the operation. As for 
Belmor, he, kneeling before that behind—the formulation of the 
details is correct as I give them, Comte?” 

The Comte nodded. 

‘‘Belmor, kneeling before that behind, laps up the blood while 
one after the other three men discharge themselves limp into his 
bum. And so, you see, what you and he have recently done is merely 
a diminutive version of jis choice vagary; here again we find the 
general truth confirmed: that in a man the lesser quirk relates 
directly to the greater, and that to the discerning eye there is no 
lack of clues pointing to a man’s predominating vice.” 

“Fuck!” I exclaimed joyously, throwing my arms around the 
Comte’s neck, “your mania makes my head fairly reel; I entreat 
you to employ my bottom in connection with quantities of such 
operations, and depend upon me to omit nothing that may con- 
tribute to the perfection of your ecstasies.” 

My Lord gave me assurance that he would be calling upon me 
before the day was out; and in a discreet whisper he besought me 
to reserve him my turd. 

“Just as I thought,’ said Clairwil. “I knew that in announc- 
ing your libertinage to her you were in no danger of displeasing 
Juliette.” 

Said Noirceuil: ‘Aye, temperance is a very foolish virtue, 
that is certain. Man is sorn for enjoyment, and through his de- 
baucheries alone does he: gain access to the sweetest pleasures of 
life. Only idiots are wont to deny themselves.” 

Now Clairwil: ‘Fo: my part, I believe that we owe it to our- 
selves to indulge blindly ‘n everything and at all costs to pursue the 
happiness we situate in the midst of the extremest irregularities.” 

And the Comte: ‘‘Nature counsels man to seek it nowhere else; 
the inconstancy that has been provided him, urging him to broaden 
the range of his sensaticns every day, conclusively shows that the 
fairest lie out of the wiy of onerous routine. Woe betide them 
who, setting shackles on a man’s passions while he is yet young, 


Juliette & 499 


develop in him the habit of self-denial and thereby render him 
the most unfortunate of beings. What a terrifying disservice is thus 
done to him—” 

“Let there be no mistake as to the aims of those who behave 

‘in this manner,” Noirceuil interrupted; ‘doubt not that they are 
motivated by jealousy, by vindictiveness . . . by fear lest others be 
as happy as those same pedants feel when they surrender to their 
own peculiar passions.” 

“Superstition,” said Belmor, “has a large hand in the thing: 
it had inevitably to compose possible offenses to the God it created; 
what else could be done? A God who is never cross with anybody, 
vexed by nothing, instead of appearing omnipotent, soon takes on 
the air of helplessness; and in what more likely place could the seed 
of crime be located than in the spurt of passion?” 

“Immense are the wrongs religion has done the world,” Noir- 
ceuil muttered. 

“Of the ills afflicting mankind,” said I, “I regard it as the 
most dangerous; he who was the first to broach the subject to men 
was plainly their greatest enemy at the time, and history provides 
no worse since. No death however atrocious would have equaled his 
deserts.” 

“The necessity to destroy it, to extirpate it,” said Belmor, 
“{s not deeply enough felt in our country.” 

‘“‘The task will be arduous,” said Noirceuil; ‘‘man cleaves to 
nothing so doggedly as to the principles he is fed in childhood. 
We shall perhaps someday see the people become prey to another 
set of prejudices quite as ridiculous as those of religion, and in the 
name of a new craze topple the idols of the former. But like unto 
the timid child, our nation will after a little begin to weep for its 
broken rattles and will soon put them back together again with a 
thousand times more fervor. No, no, philosophy is not something 
you shall ever observe in the people, too rude, too dense ever to be 
softened and refined by the sacred torch of that goddess; sacerdotal 
authority, perhaps enfeebled temporarily, will only re-establish it- 
self the more forcefully, and ’twill be to the end of time you'll see 
superstition supplying its venom to human thirst.” 

“That is a horrible prediction.” 

“It is horribly apt to be true.” 


500 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘Is there no remedy for our plight ?” 

“One,” said the Comte, ‘only one, it is violent but it is sure: 
we must arrest and slaughter all the priests in a single day and 
deal similarly with all their followers; simultaneously, inside the 
space of the same minute, destroy every last vestige of Catholicism; 
and concurrently proclain atheistic systems, and instantly entrust to 
philosophers the education of our youth; print, publish, distribute, 
give out, everywhere dsplay those writings which propagate in- 
credulity, unbelief, and for fifty years prosecute and put to death 
every individual, without exception, who might think to re-inflate 
the balloon." But, you may hear it insolently objected to this, sever- 
ity makes proselytes to a cause; intolerance is the soil whereifi all 
martyrs grow. These replies are absurd. All this they are telling 
me has happened in the past, to be sure, but only because hitherto 
the process has been conducted far too gently, far too lazily, 
far too vaguely: the surgery has now and again been attempted, 
but cautiously, fumblingly, then suspended short of completion, 
never pursued to the er.d. You don’t confine yourself to severing 
one of the Hydra’s heads, it’s the entire monster you must 
exterminate; if your martyrs have confronted death courageously 
it is because they were inspired and enheartened by their prede- 
cessors. Massacre them all at a stroke, let nothing remain, and 
from then on you'll have done with both sectarians and martyrs.” 

‘This is not an easy operation,” Clairwil hazarded. 

“Infinitely easier than one might think,” Belmor replied, ‘‘and 
I am prepared to direct it if the government cares to place twenty- 
five thousand men under my command; the elements of success 
are some political support, secrecy, and firmness: no flabbiness, 
that’s essential, and no keeping people waiting in line. You fear 
martyrs, you'll have them so long as a single worshiper of that 
abominable Christian God is left alive—” 

“But,” I declared, ‘‘are you not going to be forced to wipe 
out two-thirds of France?” 


11 Simply compare the oceans of blood these knaves have spilled over the course 
of eighteen centuries with the lakes of it promised by Belmor’s measures, and one 
cannot but conclude that in qualifying his remedy as violent, the Comte speaks with 
a touch of irony. For no juster measures have ever been proposed, and peace shall 
not reign among men until this one is adopted and carried ruthlessly out. 


Juliette & 501 


“Not even one-third,” Belmor assured us; “but supposing the 
destruction were to have to be as extensive as you say, would it 
not be a hundred times better that our fair part of Europe be 
inhabited by ten million honest folk rather than by twenty-five 
million rascals? However, I repeat, it is exceedingly doubtful that 
France counts as many Christians as you seem to imagine; at any 
rate, separating the sheep from the goats would not take long. 
Compiling my lists should require no more than a year’s work in 
shadow and silence; and I’d not unleash the campaign until I was 
sure of all the objectives it entailed.” 

“The bloodshed would be stupendous.” 

“Granted; but it would ensure France’s health and happiness 
forever; it is a potent remedy administered to a vigorous body: 
repairing matters all at one stroke, it eliminates the need for con- 
tinual purgings which, become too numerous, finally result in com- 
plete exhaustion. 

“Be well persuaded of it, eighteen hundred years of thorns 
in France’s side have been planted there only by religious fac- 
tions.’ 

“From what you say, Comte, are we to infer that you think 
poorly of religion in general ?” 

“I see it weigh upon nations like a plague. Had I not such 
love for my country I would perhaps be less opposed to those forces 
which tend to maim and ruin it—”’ 

“‘May the government charge you with the mission you de- 
sire,” said Noirceuil, “I too would be delighted by the results, since 
it would cleanse out of the portion of the globe where I live an 
abominable confession which I hate at least as much as you do.” 

We had completed a most sumptuous meal and the hour being 
late, we went straight to the Sodality after coffee. 

The inauguration of a president was accompanied by a curious 
traditional custom. The presidential chair was, as you know, upon 
an elevated platform; now, before and below it, a large pouf 
was placed, over it the new chief officer bent, and each Sodality 
member stepped forward in turn to kiss his ass. When he had

gathered homage from everyone, the Comte rose and mounted 
to his throne. 

‘Fellow members,” he began, “Jove is the subject of the 
speech I have prepared for this august occasion. Although my re- 
marks may appear to be addressed to men only, I believe I may 
venture to say that they contain virtually everything a woman 
need hear to ensure her protection against this grave peril.” 

Then, adjusting his dress, and silence descending upon the 
assembly, he expressed himself in the following terms: 

“The word Jove is used to designate that deep-seated feeling 
which propels us, as it were despite ourselves, toward some foreign 
object or other; which provokes in us a keen desire to become united 
to it, to ever lessen the distance between it and ourselves . . . which 
delights us, ravishes us . . . renders us ecstatic when we achieve 
that union, and which casts us into despond, which tears us asunder, 
whenever the intrusion of external considerations constrain us to 
rupture this union. If only this extravagance never led to any- 
thing more serious than pleasure intensified by the ardor, the 
abandon, inherent in it, it would merely be ridiculous; but as it 
leads us into a certain metaphysic, which, confounding us with the 
loved object, transforming us into it, making its actions, its needs, 
its desires quite as vital and dear to us as our own—through this 
alone it becomes exceedingly dangerous, by detaching us from our- 
selves, and by causing us to neglect our interests in favor of the be- 
loved’s; by identifying us, so to speak, with this object, it causes us 
to assume its woes, its griefs, its chagrins, and thus consequently 
adds to the sum of our own. Meanwhile, the dread of losing that 
object, or of seeing its feelings for us pale and vanish, harries us un- 
ceasingly; and though a: the outset we be in the serenest of states, 
this cross once become our burden we gradually sink into what is 
doubtless the cruelest that can be imagined on earth. If the reward 
for so many pains, or their counterpart, were anything beyond an 
ordinary spasm, I might: perhaps recommend risking it; but all the 
cares, all the torments, all the anguishes and nuisances of love 
never yield anything but what might be conveniently obtained with- 
out it; why then must one put on these chains! When a beautiful 
woman offers herself to me, and when I fall in love with her, 
my ambitions in her regard nevertheless remain no different from 


Juliette & 503 


those of another who claps eyes on her and who desires her without 
feeling for her any sort of love at all; both he and I want to lie with 
her—he, ’tis but her body he desires; and J, by a fallacious and al- 
ways perilous metaphysic blinding myself to the veritable motive 
which, howbeit, is not one whit different from my rival’s, I per- 
suade myself that it’s only her heart I want, that all carnal pos- 
session of her is quite aside from the question, banished therefrom, 
and of this I persuade myself so thoroughly that I would gratefully 
come to an arrangement with this woman, whereby I would love 
her only for her self and purchase her heart at the price of sacri- 
ficing all my physical desires. There is the cruel cause of my error; 
there is what is about to drag me down into a frightful abyss of 
unhappiness, there is what is about to spoil my life: I am in love, 
from now on everything is going to change: suspicions, jealousies, 
alarms, worries are going to become my eternal fare, the very 
substance of my wretched existence; and the nearer I come to the 
day when happiness shall be mine, the greater shall be the store 
I set by it, and the worse’shall become the fatal terror of losing it. 

“By refusing the thorns of this dangerous sentiment you 
must not think that I deprive myself of its roses; no, this will enable 
me to pluck them without danger; I'll retain only the nectar in the 
flower, discarding the dross of extraneous matter ; likewise Ill have 
possession of the body I desire and shall not have that of the soul, 
which is of no use to me at all. Were.man to reflect more carefully 
upon his true interests in pleasure-taking, he would spare his heart 
this cruel fever that burns and wastes it: if he could but realize that 
there is no need to be loved in order to be satisfied, and that love 
acts rathef to hinder than to promote the transports of enjoyment, 
he would disdain this metaphysic of sentiment which beclouds his 
understanding, confine himself to the simple enjoyment of bodies, 
would make acquaintance of true happiness, and would deliver 
himself forever from the anxieties inseparable from his baneful 
fineness of feeling. 

“Tis an intellectual construction . . . a mystification, an en- 
tirely fictitious, chimerical sensation, this delicacy we would intro- 
duce into the desire of enjoyment; it sometimes assumes consider- 
able importance in the metaphysic of love; it’s the same here as 
with all illusions, they embellish one another reciprocally. But 


504 » THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


delicacy is useless, even disruptive, in all that pertains to the satis- 
faction of the senses: the complete inutility of love now becomes 
very evident, and the rztional individual can no longer behold 
the object of his pleasures as anything more than an object which 
causes a sharp rise in the temperature of the neural fluids, than a 
creature of precious little account per se, a creature whose function 
is simply to contribute to the purely physical satisfaction of the 
desires that have caught fre from the heat it has provoked in this 
neural fluid, and which, this satisfaction once given and received, 
loses, in the thinking man’s eyes, all particular attributes, return- 
ing to its former anonymous place within its general class. It is not 
unique in its species, he will be able to find other samples of the 
same thing, equally good, equally compliable; he was living well 
before this encounter, why should he not live just as well after it? 
In what possible way could he be disturbed by this woman’s infi- 
delity ? When she lavishes her favors upon somebody else, will she 
be robbing her lover of anything? He has had his fair turn, what is 
he complaining about now? Why should somebody else not have 
his turn too, and what will he lose in this creature that he cannot 
immediately find in another? Put case that she is false to him and 
lies with a rival, she can quite as easily deceive that rival and get 
back into bed with him; she is thus no more in love with this 
second lover than with the first; wherefore should either of them 
be jealous, since neither is treated better than the other? Such 
regrets might, at the vzry most, be pardonable if this cherished 
woman were the only one in the world; they are preposterous once 
loss of her is reparable. Imagining myself for a moment in our 
first lover’s place, what is there about this creature, I wonder, that 
can give rise to my dolor? She made some fuss over my person, 
to my feelings made some responses; if they seemed emphatic at 
all, it was because illusion supplied nine-tenths of their force; mere 
eagerness to possess this: woman, my curiosity about her, my strata- 
gems to gain her, these embellished her in my eyes, and if the 
having of her does not make the scales drop away, it is either be- 
cause I yet want experience in these things or am still laboring 
under the effects of my earlier mistakes, it is the blindfold I used 
to wear and was accustomed to in the days before I came to know 
anything about women, which, in spite of me, now returns to

obscure my vision and befuddle my brain again; and I do not snatch 
it off and fling it away! It is weakness, it is most unmanly; the 
romping over with, let’s consider her analytically, this Aphrodite 
who dazzled us a short while ago. Here, in this moment of calm 
and weariness, here is the opportunity for a scientific survey; as 
Lucretius says, let’s have a glance into the backstage of life. Well, 
we shall find her, this celestial object we were enthralled by, en- 
tranced by, we shall find her endowed with the same desires, the 
same needs, the same shape of body, the same appetites, afflicted 
by the same infirmities as all the other creatures of her sex; and 
cold-blooded examination dispelling the ridiculous enthusiasm that 
drove us toward this object, in no particular different from all the 
rest of its kind, we shall see that in having it no more we lack noth- 
ing that cannot be easily replaced. Amenities of character comprise 
an element that is not relevant to our discussion; these virtues 
falling entirely inside the domain of friendship, they ought only 
be appreciated there; but, in love, I am wrong if I believe it was 
that which attracted me: no, it’s solely the body I love, and it’s 
the body alone whose loss I lament, though I can get another as 
good, just like it, whenever I please; how pointless now are my 
whinings, and how superfluous my regrets! 

“Let us have the courage to acknowledge the truth: in no case 
is a woman designed to ensure the exclusive happiness of one man; 
viewed froi the angle of his enjoyment, she can hardly be said to 
render it complete, for he obtains better and livelier in conversation 
with his fellows; while if now she be regarded in the role of a 
friend, her duplicity and her servility, or rather her baseness, 
scarcely favor the perfection of the sentiment of friendship; friend- 
ship requires openness and equality; when one of two friends 
dominates the other, friendship is destroyed; now, this preponder- 
ance of one of the two sexes over the other, fatal to friendship, 
exists necessarily where two friends are of unlike.sex; thus, woman 
is good neither as a mistress nor as a friend; she is only where she 
belongs when in the sefvitude where the Orientals keep her; her 
usefulness extends no farther than the pleasure she can afford, 
after which, as good King Chilperic used to say, best have away 
with her as promptly as ever you can. 

“If it is easy to demonstrate that love is nothing but a na- 


506 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tional superstition; that three-fourths of the world’s societies, 
whose custom is to keep their females under lock and key, have 
never been subject to the ravages of this imagirfative disorder; so 
now, in tracing this superstition back to its sources, we shall have 
little trouble assuring ourselves that it is merely an ailment and 
arriving at the sure means for curing it. Now, it is certain that this 
our chivalric gallantry, which ridiculously proposes as the object 
for our veneration that object which is made only for our needs, it 
is certain, I say, that this attitude comes from the respect our an- 
cestors used long ago to have for women owing to the witchcraft 
and the prophetic trades they exercised in the towns and rural 
places; terror turned resject into worship, and gallantry was born 
from the womb of ignorant superstition. But this respect was not 
natural, you’ll waste your time scanning Nature for any sign of it; 
the inferiority of females to males is established and patent, there 
is nothing in their sex which can constitute a solid title to our 
respect; and love, begot of this blind respect, is, like it, a super- 
stition: respect for women increases the farther the principles 
animating a given government depart from those of Nature; so 
long as men remain obedient to her fundamental laws, however, 
they are bound to hold women in supremest contempt; women be- 
come gods when those laws cease to be heeded, for when Nature’s 
voice grows faint in me1 they become enfeebled, and the weaker 
must inevitably command where the stronger degrade themselves : 
wherefore it is that government is always debilitated when women 
reign; cite not to me the example of Turkey, if her government is 
weak today this was not the case before harem intrigues began to 
regulate its workings: the Turks destroyed the Byzantine Empire 
in the days when they dragged that sex in chains, and when in 
the presence of his marshaled army Mahomet II beheaded Irene, 
who was suspected of having overmuch influence upon him. Woman- 
worship, however mild, attests baseness and sore depravation; for 
it is impossible even ir. the moment of ecstasy, how can it be 
possible afterward? If because something proves serviceable this 
be reason for deifying it, you owe a like reverence to your bull, 
your donkey, your chamberpot, etc. 

“That which they all love is, in short, nothing else than the 
desire to enjoy; so long as it exists, worship is of no help; 


Juliette 2 507 


so soon as it is satisfied, worship is impossible: which proves that 
it was certainly not from worship the respect was born, but the 
contrary. Glance at examples showing the lowly position women 
occupied in the past and yet occupy in a great many lands today, 
and you will conclude, if you are yet in any doubt, that the meta- 
physical passion of love is in no wise innate in man but is the fruit 
of his erroneous thinking and mistaken practices, and that the ob- 
ject which gave rise to this passion, generally scorned everywhere, 
ought never have blinded him. 

“Such is that scorn amongst the Croats, more particularly 
known to geographers as Uskoks and Morlacks,"* that when they 
refer to their wives, they employ the same coarse expression the 
vulgar commonly use in connection with a vile animal.** They never 
suffer them in their beds, women in that part of the world sleep on 
the bare ground, without a murmur and with utmost alacrity do as 
they are told, and are mercilessly beaten at the least hint of dis- 
obedience; their subordinate situation, their drudgeries, and their 
fare remain unchanged at all times, even when they are with child: 
they are often seen to give birth in open fields, pick up their off- 
spring, wash it in the nearest stream, bring it home, and resume 
their chores; and observers have remarked that in this country the 
children are a good deal healthier and more robust, the wives a 
good deal more faithful, than elsewhere; it would seem that Nature 
is loath to relinquish the rights which decadent habits and false 
delicacy seek to strip her of in our climates without achieving any 
other result than abasing our sex in ranking it evenly with the other 
Nature created to be its slave. 

“In Zaporozhian Cossack country women are excluded from 
the clan; those who serve-for propagational purposes are relegated 
to islands, and when in need men go thither to use them, but hap- 
hazardly, indifferently; need eliminates all considerations of age, 
looks, kinship, in such wise that the father begets children on his 
daughter; the brother on his sister; and no other laws with these 
people, save such as need establishes.

“There are places where, when women menstruate, they are 
treated like beasts; they are penned, caged, shut up tight, food is 
thrown to them from a goodly distance—so tigers are fed, or bears; 
do you fancy these people go to much bother loving their wives? 

“In the kingdom of Loango, in Africa, pregnant women are 
yet more rudely dealt with; once in this state, they are reckoned 
more than ever impure, misshapen, and disgusting; and indeed, 
pray tell me, what is there more frightful to see than an expectant 
mother ? Gravid and stark naked, it is thus the entire sex ought to 
be shown to its admirers, since they have a liking for the grotesque 
and the horrible. 

‘‘A woman gives birth, and the blacks of Barray suspend all 
commerce with her for four years and upward. 

“The wives of Maclura, alluding to their husbands, speak in 
circumlocutions; which signify the profound respect they have for 
them. 

“The Romans and the Celts held the right of life and death 
over their wives, and exercised it often; this is a right we have by 
Nature: flouting her and weakening her laws, when we neglect to 
use it. 

“Their bondage is grim throughout almost all of Africa; she 
esteems herself beyond words fortunate when her husband deigns 
to accept her attentions. 

“They are so ill-trzated, so unhappy in the principality of 
Juida, that those who are recruited for the harems of the prince 
prefer, when they can, to kill themselves rather than be taken there, 
this sovereign never making dalliance of a woman without, they 
say, subjecting her to execrable discomforts. 

“Do we bend a glance at those magnificent retreats in Asia: 
there we see proud despots, whose desires have the force of orders, 
exposing purest beauty to all such nasty whims as imagination may 
compose, and reducing to the lowest level of degradation those in- 
solent divinities whom we, to our disgrace, revere.

form a kind of dromedary, the four sturdiest being its legs; His 
Majesty is hoisted up into the saddle, and off they trot. I leave you 
to speculate upon this monarch’s conduct inside his pleasure palaces, 
and upon what his astonishment would be if someone were to tell 
him that the very same creatures he uses for Bums -wipes were ob- 
jects of worship in Europe. 

“The Muscovites are unwilling to eat anything that has been 
killed by a woman. 

“Ah! be certain of it, my brothers, it was not to see us grovel 
in the grips of a sentiment so base as love that Nature put muscle 
and intelligence on our side: it was to rule that weaker and de- 
ceitful sex, to force it into our desires’ service; and we totally 
forget her intentions when we accord some independence, let alone 
some ascendancy, to beings whom she made to be absolutely in our 
power. 

“We fancy there is happiness to be found in the affection 
we fancy women to have for us; but that sentiment, always 
meretricious, is always measured out, so much, so little, depending 
upon the need a woman calculates she has of us, or upon the sort 
of passion we flatter in her; let age whiten our hairs, or let there 
be an adverse shift in our fortunes, so that we can no longer serve 
her pleasures, her greed, or her pride, and she abandons us upon 
the spot, frequently to become our most mortal enemy. In any case, 
we have no crueler foes than women, even those who adore us 
sincerely; if we consult them for our pleasures, then they tyrannize 
over us; if we snub them, then they look for revenge and always end 
up doing us ill; whence it results that of all man’s passions, love 
is the most dangerous and that against which he should take the 
greatest care to defend himself. 

“To judge whether love be madness, is not the lover’s dis- 
traction sufficient proof of it? or that fatal illusion he entertains, 
which causes him to ascribe such charms to the object he dotes upon 
and goes scampering about praising to the skies? Not a flaw that 
has not been rewrought into a virtue; not a defect that does not 
become a beauty; all that is ridiculous in her is changed into grace; 
ha! when the tempest subsides and the lover, open-eyed, can coolly 
inspect the contemptible object of his enthusiasms, must he not, 


510 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


as he blushes before his despicable error, at least make firm resolu- 
tions never to be misled in the future ? 

‘Inconstancy and libertinage, those, my brothers, are the two 
antidotes to love; accustoming us to dealings with these false 
divinities, they both exert a gradual erosive action upon the illu- 
sion, till finally it is all eaten quite away; you cease sooner or later 
to adore what you see every day: thanks to the habit of inconstancy 
and of libertinage, the heart loses, little by little, the dangerous 
softness which permits it to be susceptible to the impressions of 
love; surfeited, it hardens, it toughens, and the patient may soon 
be considered cured. What! shall I go mope before the door of this 
creature who only lets me in at last to put the remnants of my 
good humor at further defiance, shall I endure all this when, if 
I pause to think an instant, I realize that with perfect ease and at 
the price of a few francs I can have the hire of a body just as fair 
as hers? We must bear it ever in mind that the woman who strives 
to get us the most inextricably into her captivity is certainly con- 
cealing flaws which would rapidly disgust us if we knew what they 
were; do we but sét our imagination to envisaging these details, 
to probing after them, t> guessing at them; and this preliminary ex- 
ercise initiated at the same moment love is born will perhaps 
succeed in extinguishing it. Be she a girl? She surely exhales some 
unhealthy odor, if not 10w then later on; is it worth your while, 
sir, to pant after a cesspool? Be she a woman? Another’s leavings 
may, I admit, momenta-ily rouse our desires... . But our love... 
and what’s to be idolized here? This vast mold that’s cast a dozen 
brats. . . . Picture her giving birth, this treasure of your heart; 
behold that shapeless mass of flesh squirm sticky and festering from 
the cavity where you believe felicity is to be found. Undress this 
the idol of your soul, undress her, even at some other time: is it 
over these two crookecl and stubby thighs you propose to rave? 
Or over this unclean, fetid gulf where they meet? Ah ha, it’s per- 
haps this apron of matted hairs hanging untidy between those same 
thighs that is due to fire your imagination . . . or else these two 
flaccid globes drooping dappily onto her navel? Would it not be on 
this nearer side but on the farther she harbors charms worth your 
homage? Lo, here they are, these two wattles of weary tallow- 
colored flesh, sheltering a livid hole that connects with the other:

oh yes, these are the wonders your mind battens on, and it is for 
their sake you sink yourself into a condition lower than the condi- 
tion of an earthworm? But what's this? I am mistaken? you are 
not attracted by any of this, there are much finer qualities than 
these that spellbind you: it is that traitorous cunning character, 
those perpetual dishonesties, that lying tongue, that shrewish scold- 
ing tone, this voice like a cat’s, or this whorishness, or this prudery, 
for woman spends her life in the one or the other of those two 
extremes; this calumny . . . this spitefulness . . . this contrariness . 
this witless i inconsequence, ever nagging, caviling, cawing stupidity. 

Yes, yes, I see it clearly, such are the attributes you cherish in 
“her, and they doubtless merit going into a dither over.* 

“Think not that I exaggerate matters: if all these defects 
are not combined in the same individual, the one you worship 
surely has her share of them; if they escape your eye, that’s because 
they are screened from your sight, but they exist, fear not, they 
exist: clothing or education may disguise what would revolt you if 
you saw it, the defect is none the less real even though you see it 
not, or not yet; hunt for it before attaching yourself, you will 
ferret it out every time, and if you be wise, my friend, halt there 
rather than throw happiness and tranquillity to the winds for the 
enjoying of an object which, certainly, infallibly, you will soon start 
to loathe. 

“Oh, my brothers, contemplate a little the host of sorrows 
this baneful passion brings in its wake . . . the cruel maladies caused 
by the sufferings it gives, the material expenditures, the loss as well 
of sleep, of ease, of appetite, of health, the obligatory renunciation 
of all other pleasures; realizing the gigantic sacrifices it entails, and 
profiting from all these examples, do as does the prudent helms- 


15 The difference between a man and a woman, of this we may be perfectly 
confident, is quite as pronounced, quite as important as between man and ape; our 
grounds for refusing to include women in our species would be quite as valid as for 
refusing to consider the chimpanzee our brother, Next to a naked woman stand a 
man of the same age and naked too; now examine them attentively, and you will 
be at no pains to discern the palpable and marked difference which (sex aside) 
exists in the composition of these two beings; you will be obliged to conclude that 
woman is simply man in an extraordinarily degraded form; there are internal 
differences as well, and these are brought to light by anatomical comparison: the 
dissection should be performed carefully and simultaneously.

man who steers not for the reef littered with the hulks of a thou- 
sand shattered vessels. 

“Eh, can you not forego these dubious pleasures when life has 
so many other, genuine, ones to offer? Why, what is this I say? life 
offers you the very same ones, and gives them to you free of any 
disagreeable accompanirients or aftermaths. Since libertinage as- 
sures you the same enjoyments and in return asks only that you 
clear them of this icy metaphysic, which adds nothing to pleasures, 
feast unrestrictedly upon everything that appeals to your senses; 
and in order to use a woman must you necessarily love her? We all 
of us here feel, it seems to me, that a woman is made much better 
use of when she is not loved or at least that loving her is perfectly 
gratuitous so long as mutters are taken no farther than that. And 
what need have we to take them farther, I should like to know, 
wherefore prolong our pleasures by a ludicrous flight of melancholy 
and madness? After five or six hours of her, have we not had quite 
enough of this woman? One night more, a hundred nights more 
would only yield us the same pleasures; while other objects hold 
new ones in store for you. What! millions of beauties await you, 
and you'd be such a fool as to bind yourself to one? Would you not 
smile at the simpleton who, invited to a magnificent banquet, ate of 
one dish only, though fivescore others were offered to his delecta- 
tion? It is diversity, it 's change, that makes for the happiness in 
life, and if every singl: object on earth can procure you a new 
delight, what manner of lunatic are you who would be the prisoner 
of somebody who can afford you only one? 

“What I have said of women, my brothers, may also be 
applied to men. Our defects are just as serious as theirs, and they 
are as unluckily moored to us as we to them, the putting on of any 
shackle is a folly, every bond is an attempt against the physical 
liberty which is our due, and which we ought to enjoy here on earth. 
And while I am wasting my time with this being, whatever it is, a 
hundred thousand others are growing old around me, who would 
much more merit my hcmage. 

“And, further, is it a mistress who can satisfy a man? Is it 
then, as slave to his goddess’ velleities and whims, which he must 
labor to content, that he will be able to devote attention to his 
personal desires? Superiority is necessary in the pleasurable act; he

of the two who shares his joy has less of it, he who obeys has none; 
get thee gone, idiotic delicacy which causes us to find charms .. . 
even in our sacrifices; these pleasure-takings, purely intellectual 
stunts, can they compare to those which involve our senses? The 
love of women is like unto that of God: in either case, we feed 
upon illusions. In the former, we wish only to love the spiritual, 
making abstraction of the corporeal, in the second, we ascribe a 
body to a spirit; and in both, we tumble to our knees before fictions. 

“Let us enjoy ourselves to the full: such is Nature’s law; and 
as it is altogether impossible to love for long the object we enjoy, 
let us calmly accept that things be with us as they are with those 
creatures we sometimes unjustly deem inferior. Do we observe the 
pigeon or the dog return and salute his companion when finished 
with her? bow and scrape, kiss her paw or claw? If loves flares up 
tn a dog, this love could as well be called need, is nothing else than 
need; once the bitch has satisfied him, indifference, 2version charac- 
terize his attitude toward her until he begins to desire again; but 
his desire will not be for the same female; all those he comes across 
will each in turn become the object of the inconstant male’s atten- 
tions; and if a dispute arises, yesterday’s favorite will be sacrificed 
as today’s rival. Ah, we err when we depart from these models, 
closer than we to Nature; they act in much nearer harmony with 
her laws; and if Nature has allotted us a few more sensitive 
faculties than they, this is in order that we refine their pleasures. 
From the moment we recognize that if the human female is more 
than an animal the difference is made up wholly of shortcomings, 
why must we reverence this portion which in fact humbles her? 
We may love her body, as the animal loves its mate’s; but let us 
have no sentiments for what we suppose distinct from the bedy, 
since precisely there is located that which counterbalances the rest, 
that which alone ought to make us reject her entire. Yes, oh yes, 
the womanish character, her surliness, her unwholesome mind, her 
perfidious soul, these ought always to dampen in me any inclination 
to enjoy a woman’s body, and if you would gauge to what extent 
his reason has been impaired by metaphysical frenzy, only listen 
to the love-sick exclaim that it is not his beloved’s body he wants, 
but her heart—her heart! that thing which should rather make 
him flee in horror from her presence. This extravagance has no

parallel; more, beauty being nothing but an affair of convention, 
love can be no more than an arbitrary sentiment once beauty’s 
traits, which are what cause love to be born, are not uniform. 

“Love thus being simply the taste describing the requirements 
of a given individual’s organs, it is a physical impulse, neither more 
nor less, and with it delicacy of feeling, sophis:icated modes of 
courtship can have nothing to do; for it is now plain that I love a 
blonde because she has attributes which establish close link with 
my senses; you love a brunette for similar reasons; and with both 
blonde and brunette, the material object becoming the instrument 
for the relief of our em nently material need, how are you going 
to apply your delicacy and your disinterest to this piece of plumb- 
ing? Do you fancy something metaphysical there? Then pride has 
induced you into prodigious error; a single glance should suffice to 
blast the illusion. Would you not call him mad, who in all earnest- 
ness insisted that he wzs fond of the sweet william’s scent but 
indifferent to the flower: There is no imagining into what incredi- 
ble absurdities a man may tumble, who will become attached to and 
guided by every metaphysical mirage. 

“But, and here I anticipate a possible objection, but this 
worship has existed throughout the ages; the Greeks and Romans 
deified Love and his mother. To this I reply, the thing may have 
come about with them as it did with us; in Greece and Rome 
women foretold the future also. Whence, probably, was born 
respect for them and from that respect, worship; I have already 
described how it may come about. However, concerning objects 
of worship, one ought to refer only very sparingly to the Ancients; 
peoples who adored fecal substances under the name of the god 
- Sterculius and the sewe:s in the shape of the goddess Cloacina 
could readily worship women, so often likened by odor to those 
two classical divinities. 

‘And so let us fina:ly use our common sense and treat these 
ridiculous idols as the Jepanese treat theirs, whenever they fail to 
obtain satisfaction from them. Let us worship away or pretend to 
worship, if you like, until our prayers have been answered and the 
desired thing has been obtained; once it is ours, let’s despise it; if 
we are refused, we'll give the idol a hundred blows with a stick, to 
teach it to disdain our wishes; or if you prefer, we shall imitate

the Ostiaks who when irked by their gods promptly take a lash to 
them; with a god that proves thoroughly useless there is but one 
thing to do: pulverize it; a feigned belief will be quite enough at 
those moments when you are in hope of results. 

‘Love is a physical need, let us avoid ever considering it any- 
thing else.’* ‘Love,’ writes Voltaire, ‘is the imagination’s embroidery 
upon Nature’s homespun.’ The aim of love, its desires, everything 
about it is:physical; forevér shun the object which would seem to 
demand anything more; absence and change are the sure remedies 
for love; one soon thinks no more about the person one has stopped 
seeing, and new delights efface the memory of old ones; regrets 
surrounding such losses do not long endure; irretrievable pleasures 
may of course engender bitter regrets, but those which are so easily 
replaced, those which are every moment reborn at every street 
corner, over these not a tear need be shed. 

‘And think now, what if love were not an evil but something 
truly good, that which does really make us happy, why, we should 
have to spend a fourth part of our lives without any enjoyment at 
all! What man dares suppose he will be able to captivate a woman’s 
heart when he is past sixty? At sixty, however, if he be soundly 
made, he has still another fifteen years’ potential enjoyment ahead 
of him; but he has lost his looks and so must bid happiness adieu! 
We shall accept no such monstrous proposition; if age withers the 
roses of springtime, it does not extinguish either the desires or the 
means to satisfy them; and the pleasures one tastes in later years, 
ever more elaborate, more choice, further divested of that stony 
metaphysic, a very grave to voluptuousness; these pleasures, I 
say, are a thousand times more delicious gathered in the depths of 
debauchery, of crapulousness, and of libertinage than were those 
he used long ago to procure his fair mistress; in those days he 
toiled for her sake, and at present his only concern is for himself. 
Watch him, mark those refinements, observe how he clings to some- 
thing which he knows he can caress for but a fleeting instant; what 
a wealth of details in his lewd amusements, how he wrings every 
drop of enjoyment from each... . notice how he would make free

zealot, has interesting things to say. 


516 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of everything and how he wants all thoughts, all attentions to be 
concentrated upon him. The mere suspicion of pleasure in the object 
he is using would alarm him, infuriate him, he wants its submission, 
and that is all. Fair-haired Hebe averts her eyes, she cannot hide 
her revulsion; it matters not to seventy-year-old Philater, it is not 
in her behalf he exerts himself; and even these gasps and shudders 
of horror he produces only contribute to his mounting delight; 
disgust is easy to inspir2; he is obliged to apply pressure; a few 
threats, then he opens his stinking mouth and sucks into it a sweet 
pure tongue; the young beauty quails; and suddenly here’s the image 
of rape and consequentl,, for Philater, one pleasure the more. At 
twenty did he experience the like? They would rush upon him, 
deluge him with kisses, bewilder him with caresses, he'd hardly 
have time enough to desire them, and it would be over in the 
twinkling of an eye, without his being sure it had happened at all. 
Indeed, can that be callizd a desire which is satisfied before it has 
had the chance to be born? And where can there be desire if it has 
not resistance to overcone? If then pleasure is only stirred up by 
the irritations of resistance encountered, and if the latter is only 
bred by aversion, it may become delicious to cause aversion, and all 
the caprices which disgust a woman may then become more sensual 
and a hundred times better than love. . . love, the absurdest of all 
follies, the most ridiculous, and doubtless the most dangerous, 
whereof I think I have given you adequate demonstration.” 

This dissertation was not, to be sure, very warmly received by 
the women present; but Belmor, who sought their praise with no 
more eagerness than he ‘Jid their sentiments, was amply consoled by 
the masculine applause that rang out heartily everywhere in the 
hall; handing the presidential attributes temporarily over to his 
predecessor, he made ready to reconnoiter the seraglios and exer- 
cise his authority there; Noirceuil, Clairwil, and I met him at the 
foot of the platform, and we all started off together toward the 
side door. We were not halfway there when a man of sixty halted 
Belmor and, asking to be allowed to express his congratulations, 
begged the favor of his ass; Belmor, unable to refuse, poised him- 
self appropriately; the sexagenarian embuggered our Belmor and 
would not restore him to us until he had discharged into the chief 
executive’s bum. 


Juliette 517 


“There’s a bit of unexpected luck,” said the Comte. 

“It is owing to your eloquence, my Lord,” Noirceuil assured 
him. 

“Materialist that I am,” said Belmor, “I’d prefer to owe it 
to my ass than to my ideas,” and we entered the game preserve, 
laughing at his Lordship’s sally. 

The President gave orders that during his inspection nobody 
be admitted into the premises apart from ourselves, who made up 
his escort; and he commenced his tour forthwith. Such a man, with 
such prepossessions, was able, as you may well imagine, to uncover 
a prodigious number of culprits; he was accompanied on his rounds 
by a quartet of executioners, two flayers, six flagellators, and four 
jailers: the first harem our procession entered was the one com- 
posed of women: to the lash he condemned thirty aged between 
five and ten, twenty-eight between ten and fifteen, forty-seven 
between fifteen and eighteen, sixty-five between eighteen and 
twenty-one; three children in the six-to-ten age group were con- 
demned to be flayed alive, three others heard the extreme penalty 
pronounced against them; among those aged between ten and 
fifteen there were six girls selected for flaying, four were appointed 
to die; the next group (fifteen to eighteen) yielded another six for 
flaying and eight for execution; while from the last group only four 
were found to merit death and five the loss of their skins. The 
creatures thus sentenced were directed into the several chambers 
where, before suffering the penalties decreed, they were first made 
available to those libertines who, out of peculiarity of taste, might 
happen to repair thither for satisfaction. Four female subjects were 
condemned to the dungeons; regarding floggings, they were all 
meted out in our presence: the naked victim was led before the 
President, he would examine her, handle her for a little, a flagella- 
tor would then take her in charge, bend her over his knees; and 
when once she was in a position where she could not budge, a 
second flagellator, armed with a switch, a cat-o’-nine-tails, or some 
other instrument of the President’s preference, would apply the 
number of strokes prescribed by him. Belmor was decent enough to 
leave the specification of a figure to us in almost every case, and I 
doubt whether we were beneath him in severity; six of those girls 
received such a hammering that, half-dead, they had to be borne

out; the whole while these lubricious operations were going ahead 
we were all four entwined in one another’s arms, there was a great 
deal of frigging done and much outpouring of fuck. 

We moved to the seraglio of men; here Clairwil agitated 
against any relapse into indulgence and made liberal essay of stimu- 
lations. Belmor, however, whose fondest practice consisted, as you 
already have heard, in the massacre of small boys, was by no means 
backward in his display of ferocity. Forty-two children of between 
seven and twelve received the lash with utmost rigor; in this same 
group there were six sentences of death and ten of flaying. Sixty- 
four lads of between twelve and eighteen were no less sternly dealt 
with ; here were three mcre death sentences, eight more flayings. In 
the upper class, comprised of those ranging from eighteen to 
twenty-five, fifty-six asses were singled out for whipping, two lives 
were lost, and three skins removed; all told, three males were 
designated for the dungeons; in addition, two matrons were given 
whippings for dereliction in the line of duty, and Belmor himself 
thrashed them till he had lifted the epidermis off their behinds. 

I had been frigging him incessantly throughout all these 
operations, his prick was in a state of excessive erection; but if I 
am to do justice to his strength of character, let it be said that he 
did not once leak a drop of sperm nor show any pity for an instant. 

“Very well now,” Noirceuil said to him, “‘let’s turn to pleas- 
ures; that passion of yours, Belmor, will you set it forth into view ?” 

“That is my intention,” said the Comte; “but dreadfully 
wrought up as I am, I mean to give an appallingly extensive vent 
to it.” 

“Excellent, we'll only enjoy it the more.” 

Whereupon the President re-examined all the little boys and 
out of the lot chose ten no older than seven. He required as many 
girls; but I having askec. to play the part of one of them, he had 
to select only nine: they were all from eighteen to twenty-one, and 
I noticed that they were without exception picked from among those 
_whom he, in his mischievousness, had lately condemned either to 
death or to flaying. Ten :nen, their eligibility determined by superi- 
ority of member alone, were appointed to fuck him during the 
forthcoming rout, and here is how it began. 

To one of the girls—the Comte suggested that I not be first, 


Juliette ® 519 


in order that I at least have the pleasure of judging the thing before 
taking a hand in it—a child was, I say, attached to the shoulders 
of one of the girls, bound to her so tightly and so thoroughly that 
the two bodies almost seemed one; then the girl, her papoose on 
her back, lay flat upon a sofa, her buttocks largely exposed; Belmor 
scrutinized, nibbled experimentally, forcefully bit and pinched the 
child’s ass, and slapped the girl’s; another girl, one of three 
thirteen-year-olds chosen for this purpose, seated herself on the 
floor between the legs of the child-carrier, and Belmor, kneeling on 
a cushion, mouth-fucked the girl who was sitting; while this was in 
progress he was embuggered, and Clairwil busied herself whipping 
his fucker. The Comte’s attitude brought his head near the buttocks 
of the girl on the sofa; two executioners now had at the bound 
child and, wounding it in a thousand places but very artfully, made 
its blood flow into the cleft between the buttocks at which the 
Comte was staring. 

“Off you go, shit!’ said he to the girl, as he caught sight of 
the nearing stream of blood, “shit, I tell you, shit into my mouth.” 

The whore obeyed; and the lecher, gluing his lips to her ass- 
hole, was thereby able to imbibe, simultaneously, the blood flowing 
out of the body of the child and the mard emerging from the ass of 
the girl. No one stirred out of formation until all the blood had 
drained from the victim; once it was manifestly dead, the girl 
carrying it was ordered to her feet and she, her burden remaining 
ever in place, went to stand at the head of the sofa, facing away 
from it, so as to provide a prospect to the Comte. I alone of the 
carriers was dispensed from this part of the ceremony; I was the 
third to mount the sofa, and the child was removed when I arose; 
all then were slaughtered in this same manner, while the ten 
fuckers fucked, the ten girls shat, and the three suckers took turns; 
Belmor discharged into each mouth, discharged without interrupt- 
ing his other activities, and the entire feat was accomplished with- 
out a single pause; Clairwil was exhausted, she may easily have 
delivered above ten thousand strokes of the whip to the asses of 
the Comte’s ten fuckers. As for Noirceuil, passably calm through- 
out, he had been content to watch affairs and to molest the behinds 
of the two extremely pretty lasses of sixteen who were frigging and 
sucking him by turns. 


520 e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘‘A charming passion,” said he to Belmor, when the President 
had discharged for the last time; “but, with his Lordship’s per- 
mission, I am going to show him that this same fancy is susceptible 
of an entertaining variation. Have them send me ten little girls of 
five or six, seven at the most, and ten boys of seventeen or so; the 
Comte’s fuckers appear still to be stiff, and I can make do with 
them.” 

Then Noirceuil began his arrangements. He had one of the 
youths lie out straight, and upon his chest he attached the little girl, 
but in such a way that her cunt was placed over the boy’s mouth; so 
taut were the cords drawn that the boy had great trouble breathing. 

“Notice,” Noirceuil pointed out to us, “that the carrier as well 
as the carried is ill-used in my operation, while in the Comte’s the 
carrier experiences no pain at all, and that is something which 
should be rectified, I feel; for, surely, these hecatombs improve as 
concomitant sufferings inzrease.”’ 

Noirceuil knelt before the carrier and mouthed his prick; the 
executioners fell to work upon the child; the suckers teated 
Noirceuil’s prick, and he was fucked; the victim’s blood was soon 
pouring over the prick Noirceuil was sucking, and he was soon 
swallowing a mixture of blood and fuck. The tenth little girl died 
at last; and thus did this barbarous caprice cost twenty children 
their lives. 

“I prefer Noirceuil’s interpretation of the scene,” said I, “and 
were it not so late I would enact it a few times myself.” 

Belmor, far from taking umbrage, congratulated Noirceuil 
upon his ingenuity. “However,” he told us, “what must prevent me 
from changing is the girls Noirceuil butchers, for I, unfortunately, I 
have the bad taste of liking to sacrifice little boys.” 

“And so do I,” said Clairwil; “there is nothing in all the 
world so delicious as choosing one’s victims from among men. What 
kind of triumph can strength obtain over weakness? where can the 
amusement be there? But how sweet are the victories the weak 
contrive to win over the strong.” 

Then addressing the two friends in that impassioned tone 
which could render her so splendid to see: “Ferocious men,” cried 
she, “massacre as many women as you like, I shall be nought if not 


Juliette & 521 


content, provided I am able to avenge every ten victims of my sex 
by one of yours.” 

Thereat we separated. Noirceuil and Belmor returned to the 
seraglio of women, and later report told of how they bagged 
another dozen victims of every description and by a wide variety 
of methods; whereas we, Clairwil and I, remained in the seraglio 
stocked with men, which we did not finally leave before having 
had ourselves fucked sixty or eighty times apiece, and achieving 
some other little atrocities in such kind as I need not trouble to 
delineate, since you have some acquaintance of these affairs. 

But a few days after the infamies we had performed at the 
Sodality in the company of Belmor and his friend, our club’s ami- 
able President waited upon me and convinced me that Clairwil had 
not been mistaken when she said he would be only too delighted to 
form a connection with me; the Comte, excessively rich, proposed 
fifty thousand francs a month for only two entertainments per 
week; Saint-Fond representing no obstacle, I saw no reason for not 
coming to an arrangement with Belmor. I told him, therefore, that 
I would be glad to be of service to him, but that the sum he offered 
would not even cover the costs of the suppers; the Comte heard me 
out and doubled his bid, agreeing to meet all additional expenses— 
which promised to be considerable, at each foregathering the 
libertine wishing to have three superb new women upon whose 
bodies he would immolate, or have immolated, a corresponding 
number of small boys; his murders once consummated, he would 
retire with me for another two or three hours of mutual friggery, 
after which he would return home. Such were his conventions; the 
bargain was struck. 

Without excepting Noirceuil and Saint-Fond, I have known 
few men so corrupt as Belmor; he was corrupt by temperament, 
through taste, and on principle; his exceedingly criminal imagina- 
tion often led him to invent things that surpassed all I had heard of, 
or even dreamt of, hitherto. 

“This imagination you laud in me, Juliette,” he said one day, 
“is precisely what in you seduced me; for lasciviousness, diversity, 
and energy I have seldom seen its equal; and you have surely 
remarked that my sweetest pleasures with you are those I taste 
when, the two of us giving free rein to fancy, we fabricate ideal 


522 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lubricities whose existence, unfortunately, is impossible. Oh, Juliette, 
how delicious are the pleasures of the imagination, and how 
voluptuously one follows out the lines of its dazzling constructions ! 
Ah, dear angel, how little do they realize what we are about, what 
we originate, what we create during these divine intervals when our 
fiery souls are plunged utterly into the impure depths of lubricity; 
what raptures we experience as, frigging each other, we come erect 
erecting phantoms; nor with what ecstatic joy we caress them... 
elaborate them .. . surround them with a thousand obscene details 
and episodes. All the ea:th is ours in these enchanted moments; not 
a single creature resists us, to our aroused senses each affords the 
kind of pleasure which to our boiling imagination each appears 
capable of giving; we devastate the planet .. . and repeople it with 
new objects, and immolite these in their turn; the means to every 
crime is ours, we commit them all; we multiply the horror an 
hundredfold; and all thz deeds ambitioned by all the most infernal 
and the most malignant spirits that ever were, in their most dis- 
‘astrous effects were nought compared to what we dare desire. . . . 
‘Happy,’ says La Mettrie, ‘happy they whose lively and wanton 
imagination keeps their senses ever whetted to the foretaste of 
pleasure!’ Truly, Juliet:e, I sometimes think the reality possessed 
is not worth the images we chase thereof, and wonder whether the 
enjoyment of that which we have not, does not much exceed the 
enjoyment of that which is ours: lo, there is your ass, Juliette, 
there before my eyes, and beauteous it is to my contemplation; but 
my imagination, a more inspired architect than Nature, a more 
cunning artisan than she, creates other asses more beautiful still; 
and the pleasure I derive from this illusion, is it not preferable to 
the one which reality is about to have me enjoy? There is beauty in 
what you offer me there but only beauty; what I invent is sublime; 
with you I am going to do nothing that anyone else may not do, 
whilst with this ass my imagination has wrought, I might do things 
which not even the gods themselves would invent.” 

Little wonder then if, with a mind like that, the Comte was 
prone to erratic flights; few men I had met had ever carried them 
to such lengths, and I had known few so attractive. But I have so 
many things sti]l to recount to you that I cannot linger over the 
horrors we committed together; let it suffice you to know that we 


Juliette & 523 


did our worst, and that your conceptions of what that might be 
probably fall short of the truth. 


About four months had elapsed since I had admitted my father 
to the honor of my couch; our conversation having transpired at 
a critical moment, there was a great danger he had got me with 
child. My fears were only too well justified; the fact had to be 
faced, a decision taken; I consulted a renowned midwife who, 
hampered by no scruples in this matter, deftly inserted a long and 
well-sharpened needle into my matrix, found the embryo, and 
pierced it. I evacuated it two hours later, experiencing no pain at 
all: this remedy, surer and better than juniper, which upsets the 
digestion, is the one I recommend to every woman who, like me, is 
courageous enough to grant greater importance to her figure and 
her health than to some molecules of organized fuck which when 
come to maturity will frequently prove the bane of her existence 
who vivified them in her womb. The scion of his excellency my 
father once dropped into the privy, I came forth trimmer: about 
the waist than ever before. 

“Juliette, I have just been given the address of a most unusual 
woman,” Clairwil confided to me one day. “We must pay her a 
call: she is a fortuneteller and also blends poisons of all ‘sorts, 
which she sells.” 

“And does she,” I asked, “give the recipe for her poisons ?”’ 

“In return for fifty louis.” 

“They are reliable?” 

“If you like she will make test of them in your presence.” 

““We must decidedly visit her. I have always been fond of the 
idea of poisoning.” 

“Ah, my dove, it is exquisite to have the lives of others arbi- 
trarily in one’s power.” 

“And killing them by poison, that must be exquisite too—I 
am sure of it, for, would you believe it? you no sooner mentioned 
the thing than I felt a quivering in my nerves, a sudden flash of 
heat... . Clairwil, I am quite certain that if you were to touch me 
now you would find me wet... .” 

Clairwil reaches a verifying hand beneath my skirts: ‘Aye, 


524 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it is so—oh, beloved child, what a mind is yours! But, Juliette,” 
she said, knitting her brows, “did you not tell me Saint-Fond gave 
you an entire chest ?”” 

I nodded. 

“Well? What have you done with it ?” 

“There is none left and I dare not ask him for more.” 

‘You mean you used it ?” 

“All of it.” 

“For his purposes ?”” 

“Yes, a third of it. The rest for my passions.” 

““Revenges?” 

“Some were revenges. There were a good many lubricities.”’ 

“Delicious creature!” 

“Oh, Clairwil, you’ never be able to conceive the horrors 
I have achieved in this domain . . . the joys I have derived from 
performing these crimes. . . . A box of poisoned almonds in my 
pocket, I used to stroll disguised through the public gardens, along 
the boulevards, into brothels; I would distribute those fatal eandies 
to all who crossed my pa*h; yes, to children also, especially to chil- 
dren. Afterward I would return to ascertain the results; were I to 
see a bier at the door of the individual upon whom the day before 
I played one of my crvel pranks, a glow would come into my 
cheeks . . . a fever into my blood . . . my head would reel. . . I 
would totter, have to lean against a wall or a lamppost for support; 
and:Nature who, doubt.ess with a view to her own needs, had 
constituted me differently from others, would in the form of an 
unspeakable paroxysm reward an action which according to the 
belief of fools ought to have offended her.” 

“All perfectly understandable, my dear,” Clairwil rejoined, 
“and the principles upor. which we have been nourishing you for 
some time, Saint-Fond, Noirceuil, and I, elucidate the workings 
and designs of Nature as regards this entire matter; it is no more 
extraordinary to come to the point you have reached than to like 
to inflict beatings, it’s the same pleasure, but refined; and once it has 
been proven to us that from the commotion of the pain experienced 
by others there results an impact upon our nervous system and in 
it a vibration which must perforce provoke lust, all possible means 
for causing pain become for us so many means for tasting pleasure; 


Juliette 525 


and starting out with little teasings, we shortly arrive at execrations. 
The causes are the same, only the effects are different; the laws of 
Nature and, even more so, satiety require that there be a gradual 
but steady growth: you begin by poking with a pin, you end up 
stabbing with a dagger; there is, furthermore, a kind of perfidy 
in the employment of poison which singularly augments its at- 
tractiveness. Well, you have excelled your teachers, Juliette, I have 
perhaps imagined more than you, but I fear have accomplished 
less—”’ 

“Imagined more!” I exclaimed. ““What the devil more can 
you have imagined ?” 

“T would like,’’ Clairwil answered, ‘“‘to find a crime which, even 
when I had left off doing it, would go on having perpetual effect, 
in such a way that so long as I lived, at every hour of the day and 
as I lay sleeping at night, I would be constantly the cause of a par- 
ticular disorder, and that this disorder might broaden to the point 
where it brought about a corruption so universal or a disturbance 
so formal that even after my life was over I would survive in the 
everlasting continuation of my wickedness. .. .” 

“For the fulfillment of your aims, my dear,” said I, “I know 
of little else than what may be termed moral murder, which is ar- 
rived at by means of counsels, writings, or actions. Belmor and I 
have discussed this question together; here is a little computation 
he made just the other day, it suggests how rapidly contagion un- 
furls and how voluptuous it may be to cause, if it is true, as neither 
you nor | have any doubt, that as the crime becomes more atro- 
cious, to that degree is the sensation enriched.” 

And Madame de Lorsange displayed to her listeners the same 
paper Belmor had given her years before. This was the text: 
“Dedicating himself to this sort of action, one libertine can easily, 
in the course of one year, corrupt three hundred children; at the 
end of thirty years he will have corrupted nine thousand; and if 
each child he has corrupted only matches him in only one-fourth of 
his corruptions, and we can hardly expect less, and if each succeeding 
year’s batch of corrupted children follows suit, as must very prob- 
ably happen, by the time those thirty years have elapsed the liber- 
tine will have seen this corruption flower in two whole generations, 
will be able to number nearly nine million persons corrupted either 


526 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


by himself or by the doctrines and examples he has disseminated.” 

“Charming,” Clairwil replied; ‘‘but the undertaking, easy 
enough to launch, must be sustained—” 

‘Not only must a full three hundred victims be regularly 
corrupted every year, one must also, insofar as one can, aid in 
the corruption of the rest.” 

“Think of it,” Clairwil murmured, ‘merely find ten con- 
federates for the simultaneous and coordinated execution of ten 
such plans, the spread of corruption would, even as they watched, 
become swifter than the most headlong progressions of the plague 
or malignant fevers.” 

“Of course,” I saici; ‘‘but it is not enough to watch develop- 
ments, such an enterprise needs constant promotion, constant main- 
tenance. To that end, and to ensure final success, a combined and 
extensive use must be made of the means I spoke of a moment 
ago: counsels, actions, writings.” 

‘You are, you know, treading on dangerous ground—” 

‘‘Admittedly; but remember Machiavelli, according to whom 
it were better to be impetuous than circumspect, because Nature 
is a woman to be mastered only by him who goes to her whip in 
hand. Experience shows, the same authority continues, that she 
far more readily grants her favors to ferocious suitors than to 
diffident.”’ 

‘Your Belmor must: be delightful,” Clairwil remarked. 

‘‘He is indeed,” sa.d I; “there are not many men so lovable, 
none more libertine—by the way, he will adore the purchases we 
are going to make; we shall have to resell them to him for their 
weight in gold—and d you really believe that however we be 
devoted to a man, whatever be our relationship to him, do you 
really believe that notwithstanding all that we should constantly 
deceive him too ?” 

“Most certainly,” was Clairwil’s reply; ‘dealing with a man, 
we have the human nature in him to contend with, and are obliged 
to proceed toward him as he always proceeds in our regard; and 
since no man is frank, why would you have us be frank with them? 
Enjoy your lover’s tastes where they concur with your caprices; 
make the most profitable use of his moral and physical faculties; 
heat yourself by the fire of his intelligence, be inspired by his

talents; but never for one instant forget that he belongs to an 
enemy sex, a sex bitterly at war with your own... that you ought 
never let pass an opportunity for avenging the insults women have 
endured at its hands, and which you yourself are every day on the 
eve of having to suffer; in short, he is a man, and you have got to 
dupe him. . . . You know, Juliette, on this head you are still of an 
incredible guilelessness: you are kindly, you are good-hearted, why, 
you respect men; whereas they must be used and deceived, and 
nothing else. From Saint-Fond you don’t glean a sixth of what 
I'd extract; had he a similar weakness for me, in your place I 
would be banking millions every day.”. 

Our conversation, held in Clairwil’s carriage while driving to 
a remote point on the edge of the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, was now 
broken off, for we were come to where the sorceress lived. 

It was a little house, isolated and lying between courtyard 
and garden; one of our lackeys rang, an old serving-woman 
answered the door. Having learned our business she bade us first 
dismiss our coachman and attendants, suggesting we have them 
wait for us at a certain wineshop some distance away; the orders 
were given and she ushered us into a small chamber. 

A quarter of an hour later Madame Durand appeared. Forty 
years of age, this was a very handsome woman, richly and grace- 
fully made, tall, with a majestic presence, Roman features, a 
wondrous skin and large expressive eyes; her speech was seemly, 
her gesture measured; her look and manners contained everything 
that announces breeding, education, and intelligence. 

‘‘Madame,” my friend addressed her, “persons well in your 
acquaintance and whom you have satisfied send us here. . . . First, 
we would have you say what the future holds in store for us, these 
twenty-five Jouis are in payment for that; next, we would have you 
provide us the wherewithal for controlling that future, I mean a 
complete assortment of the poisons you prepare. And there,” 
Clairwil went on, tendering her fifty Joués more, “is the sum you 
ordinarily ask for instruction in the composing of those same 
poisons, and for showing the beginner your laboratory and your 
garden of venomous plants. Be sure of it, our interest in these 
things is practical.” 

‘Let me begin by saying,” Durand replied, “that you are two 


528 @» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


extremely pretty women, and as such, before anything else, you 
shall have to undergo initial and quite indispensable ceremonies 
which may perhaps displease you.” 

Clairwil inquired in what these ceremonies consisted. 

“You must accompany me into a dimly lit cabinet,” said the 
sorceress, “where, once you have removed all your clothes, you 
shall be flogged by me.” 

“Vigorously ?” 

“Until the blood flows, my fair friends. . . yes, until the lash 
draws blood from your bodies: I never give out the least informa- 
tion save this little request be complied with; more, I have need 
of your blood for the avguries, and of blood resultant from a pre- 
liminary fustigation.” 

“Come along,” I said to Clairwil, ‘‘under circumstances like 
these one must demur to nothing.” 

The cabinet into wiich Durand led us was too unusual not to 
merit a description; and though for illumination there was but 
one smoky lamp, we could still discern objects well enough to 
make out their details. ‘This cabinet, painted black, was about nine 
feet wide by twelve long; all along the wall to the right were 
alembics, furnaces, and other instruments of chemistry; to the left, 
shelves containing bottles and jars in great profusion, numerous 
books, there was a workbench, a stool; opposite us, at the farther 
end, hung a black curtain dividing this room from another; the 
curtain fell upon a divan, dividing it also, so that half the divan 
was in the cabinet, half in the room beyond; and there was, rising in 
the center, a velvet-covered wooden post to which Madame Durand 
attached us, face to face. 

“So then,” this personage demanded, ‘‘are you resolved to 
suffer some pain to acquire the knowledge you seek ?” 

‘“‘Lay on, Madame,” we answered, “lay on, we are prepared 
for whatever may come.” : 

At that Durand kissed each of us very amorously, gave our 
buttocks a friendly squeeze, and blindfolded us; and from this 
moment onward silence was observed: we were softly approached, 
by whom we could not be sure, and given fifty strokes each. They 
were but rods that were first used upon us, but willow rods so green 
and so tough and wielded with such force that, notwithstanding our 


Juliette » 529 


habituation to these pleasures, I think this volley of cuts may well 
have opened our skin. However, we durst not complain, and not a 
word was said to us. Our buttocks were palpated then, and it is 
certain those hands were not Madame Durand’s. 

Our tormentor set to work anew, and now we could be in no 
more doubt of his sex: a prick made contact with our behinds, was 
rubbed in the blood oozing forth from them; some sighs, some 
voluptuous moans were heard, and two or three kisses were be- 
stowed on our assholes, a tongue even twittered into them, then 
twittered out again; a third attack occurred, but the rods had been 
laid aside; numb though our asses were, we had no trouble deciding 
that here the instrument being employed was a cat, the tips whereof 
were sharp; so indeed they must have been, for I immediately felt 
blood course down my legs and gather in a puddle around my bare 
feet. Back came the prick, back came the tongue, and the ceremony 
terminated. The blindfolds were taken away and all we saw was 
Madame Durand; a saucer in her hand; she placed it beneath 
Clairwil’s buttocks, placed another beneath mine; then when they 
were brimful with blood, removed them and loosed our bonds. She 
sponged our behinds with water and vinegar and asked us, had it 
hurt? 

‘Never mind,” said we, “‘is there anything else that has to be 
done ?”’ 

“Yes,” Durand replied; ‘‘you must be frigged about the clito- 
ris: I can make you no predictions unless I have observed you in 
pleasure’s throes.” 

The sorceress now had us stretch out side by side upon the 
divan; thanks to the curtain bisecting it, we were from the waist 
down in the cabinet, from the waist up in the room adjoining. By 
means of a strap passed across our midriffs Durand fixed us to the 
couch: unable to sit up, we would be unable to make out with whom 
we were having to do. She, half-naked herself, had settled near us; 
her superb breasts were placed where we could kiss them; she 
watched us carefully and glanced from time to time at the two 
saucers. Our friggings started with the clitoris, very knowing 
attentions were then turned to our cunts and assholes; we were 
tongued in both those orifices; other straps were fastened around 


530 fd THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


our ankles, our legs were hoisted into the air; and a mediocre prick 
was introduced alternately into our cunts and our bums. 

Detecting the hoax, I spoke up at once: “I should hope, 
Madame, that you have at least some assurance of this man’s 
trustworthiness ?”’ 

“Simple creature,” was Durand’s response, “’tis not a man 
who is taking his pleasur2 with you, ’tis God.” 

‘Madame, you are inad,” Clairwil affirmed, “there is no God; 
and if there were, all his acts approaching to perfection, he might 
perhaps have himself ernbuggered, but for a certainty he would 
not fuck women.” 

“Silence,” Durand commanded; ‘‘concentrate upon fleshly im- 
pressions without frettiny: over the identity of those who cause you 
to feel them: if you utte- another word, all shall be in vain.” 

‘““We shall not say anymore,” I replied, “but mark you well, 
Madame, we want neither the pox nor offspring.” 

“None of these things is to be feared with God,” Durand 
declared; ‘now an end to this conversation, there is nothing further 
I can say.” 

And I very distinctly felt the prick belonging to the personage 
aboard me discharge abundantly inside my bowels; he even swore, 
he stormed, he fumed; and that same instant, hardly noticing what 
was happening, we were borne aloft, divan and all. 

We found ourselves in a largely unfurnished room which, 
judging from the time we took ascending there, seemed very high 
up; no more curtain separating our heads from our bodies now; 
another machinery had conveyed Durand, she was there, so also 
were two little girls of :hirteen or fourteen: they were sitting in 
armchairs and were bound fast. ... From their countenances, from 
their pallor it was plain to see those creatures had been reared in 
extreme poverty; not far from them lay, in a cradle, two infant 
boys nine months of age; a big table was in the room, ranged upon 
it were numerous parcels resembling those enveloping drugs in a 
pharmacy: and also in this room were a great many more Jars and 
bottles than we had seen in the other. 

“It is here I pronounce opinion,” said Durand. 

And she undid the strap pinioning us. 

“You, Clairwil,”’ she began, looking hard into the dish con- 


Juliette 2 531 


taining her blood, “and you see that I know your name, without 
anybody having told me it; you, Clairwil, shall live only five years 
longer; but for the excesses you indulge in you would be able to live 
to sixty: your fortune shall increase as your health declines, and 
the day the Bear moves into the Scales you shall regret the flowers 
of springtime.” 

“T do not understand.” 

“Write down my words and the day will come when their 
meaning shall be very clear.” 

At this my friend seemed worried. 

“As for you, Juliette—and, pray tell me, who ever could have 
given me your name?—you, Juliette, shall be enlightened by a 
dream, an angel will appear to you, it will unveil incomprehensi- 
ble truths; but between now and then I may foretell this: when 
vice doth cease woe shall betide.” 

And now a thick cloud filled the room. Durand fell into a 
trance, she shrieked, did strange contortions, in doing them shook 
off the little that still adorned her lovely body; the cloud having 
dissipated, she returned to her senses. That vapor had left an odor 
of mingled amber and sulphur in the air. Our clothes were restored 
to us; once we were dressed Durand asked us what kinds of poison 
we desired. 

“Your prediction distresses me,” said Clairwil; “death inside 
five years |” 

“Ah, who knows? May be you will avoid it,” Durand replied. 
“[ told you what I saw in your fate, my eyes sometimes deceive me.” 

“Let me cling to that hope, else I must truly despair,” said 
Clairwil; ‘“‘but perhaps she errs in another direction, and I have 
only a week to live? So be it; such time as remains to me I shall 
spend ‘soiling myself in crimes. Eh then, Madame, be quick about 
it, show me your wares; open your jars, let us see the weird plants 
in your garden: explain to us all the properties of all these lethal 
things, we'll set aside those which please us, and you can dress a 
reckoning afterward.” 

‘I must have twenty-five Jouis more,” said the witch, “that is 
the fee for admission to my exhibits; later you will pay for the 
separate items you select, according to the rate of each. You may 
wish to experiment with them, you will of course be at liberty to 


532 cd» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


do so: those two little girls are at your disposal, and if they do not 
suffice I will furnish you, at fifty Jouis a head, as many men as you 
like.” 

“You are delightful, Madame,” I exclaimed, throwing my 
arms around Durand’s neck, “I am so happy we consulted you, and 
I am certain you shall be happy to have us for clients.” 

Taking down the jars from the shelves one at a time, she 
began by showing us aphrodisiacs and love philters as well as 
emmenagogic agents, electuaries, and other antiaphrodisiac purga- 
tives. We had an ample store of the former done into packages, 
amongst them goodly arnounts of cantharides, ginseng, and several 
vials of Joui liqueur from Japan for which, because of its rarity 
and its unusual virtues, Durand charged us ten Jouis an ounce. 

“Add to my list some larger flasks of the latter,” said Clairwil, 
“they will be helpful to me in my dealings with lots of men.” 

“We now come to the poisons,” said Durand; “if it is some- 
times pleasant to labor at propagating the human species, it is 
more often delicious to hinder its progress.” 

“These actions should not be mentioned in the same breath,” I 
protested, ‘‘the one is horrible, the other divine; our aim in buying 
these philters is not to promote the population, it is to increase our 
lubricity; and that prozeniture which we detest, ’tis for the de- 
lectable destruction thereof we intend to buy the rest.” 

“Kiss me,” said Durand. “Ah, here are two women of the 
stripe I adore. The better we come to know one another, the better, 
I am convinced of it, we shall get on.” 

These poisons were in very great number, each classified 
according to its category. In the first we examined, Durand drew 
our attention to a powder where the basic ingredient was vert toad; 
what she related of its effects was so exciting to hear that we be- 
sought Durand to make trial of it there and then. 

“Gladly,” said she, “designate the victim.” And after having 
detached the girl we pcinted to, she wondered whether we fancied 
having her fucked by a man, and poisoning her meanwhile; we 
rejoiced in this suggestion. Wherewith Durand rang, and in answer 
to her call appeared a tall individual, lank, pale, and nervous, some 
fifty years of age and in a very neglected state. 


Juliette 2 533 


“There,” I whispered to my companion, “he’s the one who 
sported with us a little while ago, I’m certain of it.” 

Clairwil nodded. “I think you’re right.” 

“Alzamor,” said Durand, ‘‘this maid must be devirginated 
while these ladies disorganize her with a powder. . . . Are you 
stiff?” 

“Turn the child over to me,” said Alzamor, mournfully, “TI 
shall do what I can.” 

“Madame, what manner of man be this?” I demanded. 

“He is an old sylph,” Durand replied, “by pronouncing a 
formula I can cause him to disappear. Would you care to see it 
done?” 

“Ves.” 

Durand uttered two barbarous words which I was unable to 
retain; where Alzamor had been there was now only smoke. 

‘‘Now make the sylph return,” said Clairwil. 

Another outlandish phrase and a second cloud brought him 
back; this time the sylph had an erection, and it was prick atower 
he caught hold of the child. This personage proceeded to give 
evidence of prodigious vigor, in two minutes he had perforated the 
girl’s maidenhead and spattered blood all about the room. "T'was 
then Clairwil administered the dose: it was dissolved in a cup of 
broth, the poor little soul quaffed it off. Her convulsions began 
promptly; when they were at their height Alzamor adjusted her 
for embuggering; her writhings, her screams increased; it was 
hideous to behold; six minutes later she collapsed and the sylph 
withheld his discharge until she was completely lifeless. Her death 
throes were noisy beyond belief; her violator, too, loosed unearthly 
sounds, and it was the violence of that ecstasy which made us 
finally conclude that, indeed, this was the man who had tupped us 
earlier on. The uncouth words were pronounced again, Alzamor 
vanished, and the victim vanished with him. 

Durand resumed the displaying of her goods and, after having 
indicated the features of the second category of poisons, said, 
“Here is burnt engri flesh, the engri is a variety of Ethiopian tiger; 
its effect is subtle, awful, and deserves to be witnessed by ladies as 
curious as yourselves.” 


534 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Then let us try some out,” Clairwil said, “but upon a young 
man.” 

“Of what age precisely?” 

“Of eighteen or twenty.” 

In a trice stood a youth, comely, prettily made, superbly 
membered, but showing such signs of privation as to leave us in no 
doubt of the class from which our sorceress chose her victims. 

“Will you amuse yourselves with him?” Durand wanted to 
know. 

“Yes,” said I, “but will you not join us? He looks capable of 
fucking the three of us.” 

“What’s this? You are of amindtoseeme fuck?” 

‘“‘We most decidedly are.” 

“I’m beastly, you will be appalled.” 

“Fie, slut,” said Clairwil, clasping her in her arms, “do your 
damnable worst—we ex ect it of you, for you are a woman after 
our own sort and we are burning to see you in action.” 

And without further ado Clairwil shoots toward the young 
man and begins to arouse him; and I, having brought Durand’s 
charms into view, with eyes, hands, and tongue begin to devour 
every part of her splendid body. Here were symmetry and 
luxuriant abundance in perfection, never was flesh so firm, so fair, 
so responsive to the touch; never were buttocks and breasts so 
smooth, so round, so ful; and this clitoris! ah, this clitoris, never 
had we in all our days seen one so long nor so straight-standing. I 
own that, catching sight of this last-named wonder, I was over- 
swept by an invincible partiality for this woman and I had already 
mouthed her member when Clairwil, leading up the youth by the 
end of his prick, brushed me aside and made ready to bury that 
prick in the enchantress' cunt: but she voiced her opposition in a 
terrible cry. 

‘Why would you require this horror of me?” she demanded. 
“Cunt-fucking is not to my liking, neither is it within my capacity, 
do you take me for an ordinary woman?” 

And driving the youth back with a powerful blow of her fist, 
she spun about and presented him her ass. Clairwil conducted the 
device which, all unprepared for this, sank its full length into this 
anus just as easily as it would have disappeared into the hugest 


Juliette & 535 


cunt. The whore then began to wriggle and cavort in the most 
lubricious manner, Clairwil and | furnished fuel to her ecstasy by 
palpating her, by fingering her, by tonguing and sucking and 
pumping her, by polluting and kissing and caressing her with all 
the means at our command, physical and moral. There is no con- 
ceiving the ardor of that woman’s imagination, the foulness of her 
talk, the originality of her lewd ideas, and the wildness of their 
incoherence; in fine, the disorder which, established by the incredi- 
ble heat of her passions, reigned throughout her entire person. 
Nearing her crisis, she clutched at our asses, kissed them; and the 
whore, after tonguing and spitting in our vents, fucked them as 
a man should have done. 

“Poison him, poison him!” she screamed as delirium invaded 
her-senses and mounted into her brain. 

“No, by God!” said Clairwil, “the wight shall bugger-fuck 
us both before we have any of that.” 

At which Durand emitted dreadful screams, howls, all her 
limbs twitching, thrashing, she succumbed to a nervous fit, and 
loosed fuck in such vast quantity that my mouth, for I was sucking 
her then, was filled to overflowing. 

“He is yet intact,” she told us, expelling the youth, “prevent 
him from discharging in order that he fuck you the better.” 

My ass chancing to be the first snapped into position, therein 
the fucker deposited the seed which Durand’s convulsing bowels 
had so well readied for ejaculation. I continued, while being em- 
buggered, to gobble the jets of fuck still spouting from Durand’s 
vagina, whose anus Clairwil was tonguing; my friend soon changed 
places with me and it was while the young man was in the midst of 
sodomizing her that the necromancer had him swallow the venom- 
ous brew. He was seized by cramps before he had time to with- 
draw from my friend’s ass, so that he perished embuggering her, 
which hurled Clairwil into transports of joy so intense I thought 
she too was in danger of dying. 

“By God,” the buggeress declared, “I do believe I got his 
soul and his fuck in the same spasm; you have no idea how the 
rascal’s prick dilated while the poison was having its effect, neither 
can you conceive the pleasure which such an operation procures.” 

Oh, voluptuous women! the time to poison your fuckers is 


536 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


while they are even in your asses or your cunts, you'll see what one 
gains thereby... . We did indeed have no end of trouble dislodging 
the murdered youth’s member from my companion’s rectum, and 
when at last we had it pried loose, we noted that his death agonies 
had not prevented him from discharging. 

“Aye, that was my impression,” said Clairwil, “did I not tell 
you he gave up the ghost and his sperm all in one throw?” 

The corpse is whisked away and pots of poison from the 
third category are disposed on the counter before us. 

Among others it ircludes the poison royal, the same which in 
the days of Louis XV trought about the deaths of so many mem- 
bers of his family; poisoned darts and hatpins; the poisons com- 
pounded of snake venoms and known under the names of cucurucu, 
kokob, and Aimorrhoiies; polpoch poison, so called after the 
reptile that inhabits a northwestern zone in faraway Jupatan. 

“TI mix it with a digestive or cordial,’ Durand explained; 
“diluted in the proportion of one drop to a pint it remains abso- 
lutely fatal; in all my experience I have never known it to fail; 
would you like to see what it can do?” 

“By all means yes,” I replied, “rest assured that such pro- 
posals are of a kind we z.re never apt to reject.” 

“And what would vou prefer in the way of a victim?” 

“An attractive young man,” Clairwil volunteered. 

Durand rang a little bell and there before us appeared a boy 
of eighteen, fairer than the previous one, and in the same state of 
dejection and misery. 

‘Will you have Al:amor embugger-him ?” 

“Gladly !” 

Another puff of smoke, and out of it steps the sylph. 

“Fuck this boy,” Durand instructs him. “Mesdames wish to 
try some polpoch brandy on him.” 

“Wait,” Clairwil interrupted, “he must embugger me in the 
meantime.” 

“And what are we to do, Madame Durand and I ?” 

“You may tongue Alzamor’s asshole, Juliette; and our hostess, 
upon whom I shall recline, will encunt me with her clitoris; my 
fuckeress, otherwise unoccupied, will, when she sees the boy about 


Juliette & 537 


to discharge in my bum, be able to hand him a little glass of the 
poison whose effects we are eager to study.” 

Everything proceeds in accordance to Clairwil’s plan until the 
moment when the young man absorbs the drink: he is shaken so 
powerfully by the poison in his vitals that postures are disturbed 
and the group must disperse; we relinquish the middle of the 
room to the patient; Alzamor frigs Clairwil, I spring into Durand’s 
arms, who tickles me exquisitely, she possesses the ultimate in art 
and experience, all the coigns and concavities of pleasure are 
explored with equal thoroughness by the libertine fingers of that 
ravishing personage, whose lips cover me with fervent kisses. The 
hard-pressed victim is by now staggering like a drunkard and while 
we look on, gradually sinks into a terrifying vertigo; the venom’s 
impact upon his brain was so fierce, that, in shrieks, he complained 
of having his head full of boiling oil; this phase was followed by a 
generalized tumefaction that spared no part of his body, his face 
became livid, his eyes bulged from their sockets, and flailing his 
arms like one drowning in the sea, the wretch fell to the floor and 
writhed and struggled there in the oddest possible manner, while 
to left and to right the four of us sprayed torrents of the impurest 
and the most abundant fuck. 

“For me,” said Clairwil, ‘“‘that is the most divine of all 
passions, the one I shall never be able to resist. I am resolved to 
indulge in it every chance I get in the future.” 

“And you may do so without fear,” said Durand, ‘“‘murder by 
poison is certain and it is safe. Witnesses? There need be none. 
Clues, telltale traces left behind whereby you may be found out? 
Let the most learned physician hunt for them, his art will avail him 
not; the effects of poison are indistinguishable from the causes of a 
natural ailment in the bowels; they accuse you nonetheless? Deny 
the charge, and be firm. Let the crime be gratuitous. So long as they 
can assign to you no motive for having committed it, you will al- 
ways be under cover.” 

“Go on, temptress, go on,” Clairwil said to her; “if you were 
to convince me I do believe I'd depopulate the whole of Paris 
tonight.” 

Durand pronounced the arcane formula; the sylph disap- 


peared. 


538 <2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Come with me to the garden,” she said, and then added, a 
note of apology in her voice: ‘you may have whatever you like 
there. And I am afraid there is not very much: the frosts were so 
severe last winter that most of my plants died.” 

This garden, an extremely somber place, bore a strong re- 
semblance to a burial ground: save where some rare plants were 
growing, sinister and grayish, it lay in the shade of tall trees. Our 
curiosity drew us toward a remote corner where we espied newly 
turned soil. 

“It’s the spot where you conceal your crimes, Durand, isn’t 
it?” Clairwil asked. 

“Come along,” the sorceress replied, guiding us in another 
direction, “it were better I show you that with which one kills 
rather than what has been killed.” 

She explained the properties of this plant, she explained those 
of another; at length, unable to curb my impatience, ‘‘Listen to me,” 
I said, ‘‘the sight of tha: cemetery just ten yards away is driving 
me quite out of my mind. Conjure up a little girl of fourteen or 
fifteen, give her a dose of whatever occasions the most agonizing 
possible gripes in a human being’s guts; we shall dig a ditch first, it 
will be there waiting for her; we shall let Nature take its course, 
and when the victim’s convulsions roll her into the pit, we'll cover 
her over with earth, and discharge.” 

“I am determined to be of service to you,” Durand replied to 
this; ‘observe: I foresaw your request, there is the girl you want. 
And glance again at the :emetery: to the east there, do you see the 
pit? It is ready.” 

Indeed, behind a wild Cayenne fig tree, there stood a very 
pretty child, naked as the day she was born; but the pit . . . we 
strained our eyes, then saw it open up in the earth, by what magic 
we could not guess. . . 

“Ha!” exulted the sorceress, gazing at us as we, petrified, 
watched these prodigies, ‘‘are you afraid of me?” 

“Afraid? No; but ‘we do not understand you.” 

‘All Nature is at my orders,” Durand answered, “as she al- 
ways submits herself to the will of whoever will probe her deep: 
with chemistry and physics nothing is beyond one’s power. Archi- 
medes lacked only a place to rest his lever, else he would have 


Juliette 539 


moved the earth; and I now need but a plant in order to destroy it 
in five minutes. .. .” 

“Delicious creature,” Clairwil said, hugging her to her breast; 
“how happy I am to have met somebody whose methods so nicely 
correspond to my aims.” 

Shutting a gate, we enclosed ourselves inside the cemetery with 
the little girl; her contortions began as soon as she had downed 
the poison. 

“Let us sit ourselves here,’ I said, “where ground seems to 
have been broken. very recently—” 

“I believe I read your thoughts,” said the sorceress. 

From her pocket she pulls out a box, opens it, sprinkles some 
powder upon the soil; and the plot beneath our feet suddenly 
becomes strewn with cadavers. 

“Oh, fuck me, what a sight!”’ cries Clairwil, wallowing amidst 
these heaps of dead bodies; “quick, let’s all three frig one another 
while we watch that little bitch suffer.” 

‘Let us take off our clothes,” Durand proposes, ‘‘with naked 
flesh we must rall upon this carrion, the sensation is voluptuous.” 

“It occurs to me,” said I, “that these bones, shaped as they 
are, might serve in the stead of pricks.” 

And Clairwil, finding the idea greatly to her taste, snatched 
up a femur and stowed it in her cunt. 

“Well done,” I remarked to my companion; “but we should be 
sitting on skulls, pointed nosebones should be prickling our assholes 
—see how I place myself. . . .” 

“Move a trifle to the left,’ said Durand, “‘there’s the head, 
perhaps still warm, at any rate fresh, of the last boy you im- 
molated: hold still a moment, Juliette, I have one of his hands, let 
me frig you with it... .” 

What now shall I say, my friends? Delirium and extravagance 
were at their height, we invented, we enacted a hundred things 
more infamous, more morbid yet; and the victim expired before 
our eyes, racked by execrable ‘convulsions: the final ones having 
flopped and pitched her to the brink of her grave, she slithered 
into it, I discharged in the embrace of my two consorts who them- 
selves smeared their fuck over me while the one sucked my nipples 
and the other drank my saliva; we donned our clothes again, and 


540 <2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


resumed our tour, just as cool as a trio of fools after having per- 
formed an exceptionally meritorious good deed. Concluding our 
visit of the garden, we re-entered Durand’s abode. 

‘The pair of infants you see in this cradle,” the sorceress now 
said, ‘‘are the material I shall use in composing the costliest and 
most potent poison I sell. Do you wish to enjoy the spectacle?” 

“Certainly,” we replied. 

“T am not surprised,” said Durand, “in you I recognize 
woman philosophers who view the disorganization of matter as a 
merely chemical operation; and the compelling importance of the 
results outweighs, in your consideration, the so-called crime lesser 
minds notice in this action. .. . 1 am going to begin.” 

Madame Durand plucks the babes out of their cradle, one 
after the other she hangs them by their feet from the ceiling, like 
hams, and lashes them mercilessly ; in time a foam bubbles from the 
mouths of the dilapidated infants, the sorceress carefully gathers 
this pink froth and sells us the little bottle for a hundred Jouis, 
certifying that of all the poisons she confections, this is the most 
virulent, and it was true. The children, to whom Durand gave no 
further heed, expired or. their hooks. Ah, who any longer doubts 
that for greatest delectation it is casually, phlegmatically, crime 
wants to be committed ? 

“Yes, my dear fried,” said Clairwil, pondering over all the 
things we had seen that day, ‘those are awful secrets you possess.” 

“IT have a good many more, Mesdames,” Durand declared. “I 
hold the lives of multitides in my hands: I can send the plague 
roaring abroad, poison streams and wells, propagate epidemics, 
contaminate the air of provinces, clap blight on houses, fields, vine- 
yards, murrain on flocks; into deadly poison transform the flesh 
of cattle, I cause villages to burn, make suddenly perish he who 
inhales the scent of a flower or who unseals a letter; in a word, I 
am a woman without peer in my kind, nay, I am unique in it.” 

“But, Madame,” I demanded, “how can somebody so well 
acquainted with Nature admit the existence of a God? When not 
long ago we inquired of you by whom we were being fucked, you 
answered ‘twas by God.” 

“Is there one more mighty than the prick?” Durand asked by 
way of answer. 


Juliette 2 541 


“Ah,” said I, “I prefer to hear you respond thus than other- 
wise. But come now, dear heart, jesting aside: you do not believe 
in God, do you?” 

“My friends,” Durand said to us, “the more one studies 
Nature, the farther one probes into her secrets; the better one 
comes to apprehend her energy, the greater grows one’s conviction 
of the futility of a God: the erecting of that empty idol is of all 
pieces of mystification the most odious, the most ludicrous, the 
most dangerous, and the most detestable; this revolting little fable, 
which wherever it exists has been whelped out of human hopes and 
fears, is the final consequence of human folly. Once again, to 
suppose an author of Nature is to misappreciate her altogether, 
only willful ignorance of all the effects of this fundamental power 
and prime mover permits the assumption of another which directs 
it, and you will never see any but idiots or rogues acknowledge or 
believe in the existence of a God. This God men have dreamt up 
is, in their presentation of him, what? an assemblage of all beings, 
all properties, all powers; the immanent and nondistinct cause of 
all natural effects. Baffled about the qualities of this fictitious being, 
in their confusion seeing him sometimes as good, sometimes as bad, 
now jealous and now vindictive, people could only be further misled 
into imagining that he had to punish and reward; but their God 
is actually only Nature, and Nature does not discriminate, neither 
does she deign to judge: zin her eyes, all her creatures are equal and 
equally indifferent; since the production of one costs her no more 
than the production of another, to her the destruction of an ox is 
no worse than the destruction of a man.” 

“And your doctrine touching the soul, what is it, Madame?” 
Clairwil asked. “For your philosophy is in too close concordance 
with our own for us not to relish an exposition of its various 
tenets.” 

“No less a materialist in my approach to the soul than, in my 
analysis of the deity, I am prepared to state,” said Durand, “that 
after having sedulously perused ail the reveries philosophers have 
left us on this chapter, I came away with my conviction unshaken 
that the soul of man, absolutely similar to that of all animals but 
otherwise modified in him owing to the difference of his organs, is 
nothing else than a quantum of that ethereal fluid, of that infinitely 


542 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


subtle matter the source whereof is sunshine. This soul, which I 
consider substantially identical in all animate things, is the purest 
fire there is in the universe: it is not hot, it does not burn by itself, 
but upon penetrating intc the hollows in our nerves its impact there 
is so explosive, it sets the animal mechanism so dynamically into 
motion as to render it capable of every sentiment and every com- 
bination thereof; in this its effect is similar to one of those of 
electricity, upon whose nature our information is still incomplete 
but which is basically the selfsame thing; upon the death of a man, 
or of some other animal, this fire is exhaled and, so a raindrop 
falling into the ocean, loses itself in the immense universal mass of 
the same matter, always existing, ever moving, perpetually active; 
the rest of the body putrifies, decomposes, and recomposes in other 
forms which other portions of this celestial fire enter and animate; 
I leave it to you to guess. in the light of this definition, what he who 
accepts it is bound to think of the comical ideas of heaven and hell.” 

‘““My dear,” said Clairwil, “after having talked to us in so 
frank a manner, and after the manner in which we have illustrated 
our adherence to principles like your own, you ought indeed, with 
the same candor, tell us who it is and what, this God by whom you 
latterly had us so well whipped and fucked; willing to unveil to 
us the mysteries of Nature, why should you fear revealing those of 
your house?” 

“Because those of Nature are everybody’s by right,” Durand 
rejoined, ‘‘whilst those of my house belong to me alone; I may 
therefore disclose them or keep them secret, whichever I wish; well, 
my wish. is not to discuss these matters with anyone, and if you 
persist in asking me about them, though you offer me the wealth of 
the Indies, you’ll go away from here empty-handed.” 

‘So be it,” said I, “let us not pester Madame with questions 
upon a subject she is not disposed to speak about; but there are 
others upon which she may be able to give us satisfaction. . . . The 
possibilities of libertinage here in your house, they exist—of this 
we are sure. What can you propose to us, for we are exceedingly 
libertine—”’ 

‘There is not a single passion,” replied Durand, ‘‘not a single 
whim or fancy, not a living being on this globe, not an extravagance 
or eccentricity, however unusual or picturesque it be, that cannot be 


Juliette 543 


enjoyed here; merely give me several hours forenotice, I will pro- 
cure you anything under the sun; let your desire be irregular, let 
it be fantastic, let it be gruesome, and this in no matter what degree, 
I solemnly promise to provide you the means to execute it. Nor is 
that all. If there be any men or women anywhere in the world, 
with whose tastes or practices you were eager to be acquainted, I 
will have them here; and unseen by them, you will watch them in 
action through a gauze curtain. This entire house is mine, the ease 
wherewith on all four sides it may be entered or left without being 
seen, its secluded location, the height of the enclosure girting it, in 
a word, its mysterious loneliness, these, I think, guarantee both 
security and pleasure, which should be carefree; so command and 
you will be served: all individuals, all races, all nations, all sexes, 
all ages, simply specify what you wish—any debauchery, every 
crime: you have but to choose. You pay well, this I know; and with 
money anything can be had in my establishment.” 

‘‘And yet you must not be in any great need of it, Madame, 
your wealth must be immense.” 

“Yes,” Durand conceded, “but I too have tastes and as I spend 
virtually everything I earn, I am not by a long shot as rich as you 
might think. . . . Yes, ladies, yes, strictest secrecy and unlimited 
facilities, such are the features of this place; you have immolated 
five or six victims so far today, assassinate five hundred more, there 
is no dearth to fear; do you wish to make further experiments upon 
boys, upon girls, upon mature persons, upon aged persons, upon 
youngsters, only say so, you will be served on the spot.” 

“T want,” said Clairwil, “to bum-fuck two fifteen-year-old 
boys with a red-hot dildo while you martyr them, and while two 
handsome lads, already gorged on poison, bum-fuck me.” 

“One hundred Jouis per victim,” said Durand, ‘‘and you will 
be satisfied.” 

‘For my part I'll have two young girls,” said I, “‘since I only 
like to do to my sex what this whore likes to do to men; I shall 
encunt them with a like device, and your sylph will lash them to 
ribbons with martinets—the points of steel must be heated to the 
same temperature; I shall be whipped throughout the operation.” 

“Fifty louis per girl,” said Durand. 

We took out our purses and in less than ten minutes every- 


544 ce THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thing was under way. The little girls given me were ever so pretty, 
and ever so ferocious were the sylph’s proceedings; the woe-begone 
victims expired in our arms and our transports were indescribable; 
the sylph and the corpses were whisked away in a flash, but our lust 
remained unappeased. Clairwil, disheveled, wild-eyed, was foaming 
at the mouth and I was hardly any calmer. Durand besought us to 
enact another drama, if that were agreeable to us it would be 
witnessed by libertine observers. 

‘Give us a victim apiece,:’ was our reply, ‘‘and your examiners 
will be contented.” 

I am provided with a charming girl, naked, her hands tied 
behind her back; a similar subject for sacrifice, but of masculine 
sex, is produced for my companion: we begin by flogging them with 
nettles, then with our martinets, the work is already well advanced 
when it is interrupted by a knock on the door: it is Durand, who 
had stepped out of the room and now returns: ‘The gentleman 
outside,” she says, “requests you to prolong the torture, and to 
turn slightly to this side while you operate: he would like a view of 
your asses whereof until now he has been unable to judge.” 

“Go, and say it will be as he wishes,” Clairwil replied. 

We resumed. The fierce creature opens the abdomen of the 
boy who has been entrusted to her, she tears out his heart and 
thrusts it hot into her cunt. 

“Ah, Juliette,” says she, her breathing becoming hoarse, “for 
ages I’ve been wanting to frig myself with a child’s heart, this 
should lead to a memorable discharge.” 

Sprawled atop the corpse of her latest victim, she yet sucked 
its mouth and chewed its tongue as she fucked herself with its 
heart. “And now,” she grunted, “let’s bury it completely.” In order 
to be able to fish it out again, she pierced it, ran a string through; 
and the lump of viscera sank out of sight. 

Clairwil set up a howl of pleasure. “Juliette,” she gasped, “try 
it, Juliette, try it, there’s nothing to equal the sensation.” 

“T once knew a man,” I said, “who had roughly the same 
mania.: he used to make a hole in a yet palpitating heart, force his 
prick into it, and discharge there.” 

“That could be charming,” said Clairwil, “but aesthetically 


Juliette 545 


less pretty than what I am doing; try it, my angel, you owe it to 
yourself.” 

There is nothing like the effect of example upon an imagination 
such as mine; it suggests, it encourages, it electrifies: I soon have 
my victim laid wide open and promptly insert its living heart 
between my labia; but, more straitly avenued than my companion, 
my efforts are unavailing, it will not enter my cunt. 

‘Slice it in two,” Clairwil urges upon noticing my plight, 
“provided some of it goes in, that is all that matters.” 

I follow her advice and having taken the same precautions 
as she, bury a fair half of the heart in my womb. The fiendish 
creature was right, for dildo this is without peer; for warmth, for 
elasticity where will you find its match? And the moral parts, my 
friends! how they are fired by these horrors. . .. Oh yes, yes, there 
is no denying it, Clairwil’s idea was excellent, and I had not dis- 
charged so deliciously in a very long time. After an hour devoted 
to these infamies we summoned Durand again. 

“Fuck!” she exclaimed upon catching sight of the frightful 
debris littering the room, “apparently, you need only be shown 
the opportunity—” 

“Exactly, and we will duplicate that massacre at any hour of 
the day,” said Clairwil; ‘come, come, my dear, murder is as 
familiar to us as it is to you, we idolize it just as passionately, 
and so long as there is killing in your house you may always count 
upon our custom.” 

“Kind friends,’ Durand said to us then, “‘there is yet some- 
thing I would propose to you.” 

“Do not hesitate.” 

“Will you help me make fifty outs?” 

“Certainly.” 

‘Then have the goodness to receive an admirer for a mo- 
ment; he has been watching you, your doings fascinate him, and 
he is burning from eagerness to make your more intimate acquaint- 
ance.” 

“Very well,” said I, “but we too wish to be paid, no money 
is more enjoyably spent than what one earns in a whorehouse; 
simply ask him for a hundred Jouis, that leaves twenty-five for 
each of us.”’ 


546 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“T am of my companion’s mind,” said Clairwil; ‘‘but what 
would the fellow do with us? One must not take payment for 
nothing.” 

“Ah,” said Durand, “you, will not be disappointed, he is 
extremely libertine; nonetheless, he is aware that you are ladies 
of condition and will treat you with fitting consideration.” 

‘Send him in,” said I, “let him only pay and not trouble to 
consider us, we are whores and intend to be treated as such.” 

In they walked: first a little man of some sixty years, short, 
stout, almost naked, with the opulent look of a financier; a 
sodomizer followed hard on his heels, tooling him on the move. 

“Lovely asses ... lovely,” he cried, handling them; ‘‘ah, ladies, 
you have done remarkable things. . . .” And while frigging him- 
self amain: “You have killed, aye . . . butchered—that’s the very 
thing I adore. How would you like to begin again? We shall do 
the same together.” 

So saying the lecher pushes me onto the bed and embuggers 
me while fondling Clairwil’s buttocks; after a few moments of 
clumsy shoving and jerking he takes up his stance behind Clairwil, 
gomorrahizes her, and, as he does, examines and nuzzles my bum. 
At this point his fucker discharges; the little man, seemingly con- 
sidering it useless to go on warring in the breach without the 
support of a good pr-ck in his rear, debuggers straight off and, 
catching up a handful of withes, he bids his fucker hold us while 
he gives us both a thrashing. The little rascal arranges us in this 
bizarre manner: facing: in the same direction, we stand close beside 
the fucker, a tall man, who faces in the direction opposite and 
prisons our heads beneath his armpits: thus is Monsieur Mondor 
confronted by a sturcy prick for frigging and two superb asses 
for belaboring, and he flies to the task. Our bums, already in very 
fit sorts, bear up bravely under the storm, and it is severe, the 
bugger does his worst; prolonged was the ordeal, and bloody too, 
he wore out six bundles of withes, and our thighs were as badly 
treated as our buttocks; during occasional pauses he sucked his 
man’s prick and when finally he got it to a stand, had us fucked 
by this superb member: after all that flagellation, you may readily 
appreciate our need of that balm. While his retainer fucked us 
turn by turn, the financier worried the fucker’s ass and thereinto 


Juliette % 547 


plunged his prick ever and again; his passion now well in the 
wind and running full-sailed, he cried out for a victim. One was 
brought him, an eleven-year-old boy: Mondor fucks him; Mondor 
is fucked: the villain orders us to carve the child open and extract 
his heart, as just before he had watched us do, and to rub it over 
his face while he discharges : all his bidding is done and the monster, 
bathed in blood and braying like a donkey, unpents his fuck. No 
sooner was he finished when, without so much as a word to us, 
he was gone out of the room. See there an example of the effects 
of libertinage upon a timid soul. It is ever the same: remorse and 
shame rush in the instant their fuck rushes out, because such 
people, unable to forge principles to themselves, always suppose 
they have behaved ill because they have not behaved quite like 
everybody else. 

“And who was that queer fellow ?” we asked Madame Durand. 

“An exceedingly wealthy man,” she answered, “but I shall 
not give you his name; you would not be pleased to have me 
publicize yours.” 

“His practices go no farther than what we have just seen?” 

“He usually does his own murdering; but today he was visibly 
not in form and therefore charged you with the chore. You say 
he impressed you as being unsure of himself? You were not mis- 
taken, he is indeed shy, overly scrupulous . . . and even very devout: 
he dashes off to pray to God after perpetrating horrors.” 

“Poor fool, he is truly to be pitied. If you cannot first conquer 
vulgar prejudices, better not venture into our way of life at all; 
for, once having elected it, he who does not advance with deter- 
mined step is heading for a great many embarrassments.” 

And after adjusting our clothes we wrapped up our purchases, 
made this valuable new acquaintance a generous settlement, and 
returned to our carriage, both of us determined to cultivate Durand 
‘and make the most extensive and frequent use of the supplies we 
had bought from her. 

“I am going to poison every creature who crosses my path,” 
Clairwil announced, “if for no other reason—and is there another 
so solid?—than to commit an action which already affects my 
senses more profoundly than most, and is soon apt to win the 
position of a favorite in my heart.” 


548 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


I was eager to introduce Belmor to Durand: they struck me 
as made for each other, and I frigged myself incontinently over 
the thought of seeing my lover in the arms of that evil witch. At 
our next encounter I mentioned her name; no, he was not acquainted 
with her; we agreed to call upon her together, and we went. After 
offering my excuses for having neglected her so dreadfully—I had 
not indeed been back since that first visit; lack of a free moment 
was the reason—I preserted the Comte to her, and the welcome 
she gave him was warm. Enchanted by everything he saw there, 
and after some heavy purchasing, he succumbed to the voluptuous 
titillations that stunning personage was causing in him. The scene, 
just as I had hoped, transpired before my eyes; first sodomizing 
her, Belmor then begged to know, would she satisfy his dearest 
passion? I provided the necessary explanations; the victims were 
produced without delay, und Belmor, aided by me, regaled himself 
delightfully. 

“Sir,” said the sorceress, “let me offer my felicitations, that 
passion of yours is charming; if you care to visit me again the 
day after tomorrow, I shall enable you to observe one of approxi- 
mately the same sort, although a thousand times more spectacular.” 

We came faithfully to the rendezvous; but nobody came to 
open the door. The shutters, we then noticed, were drawn over 
the windows, the house seemed deserted; and we went away. 
Despite the great many inquiries I made, I was never able to 
discover what became of that remarkable woman. 


Nothing very out of the ordinary befell me in the course of 
the next two years; I livecl higher than ever before, my debaucheries 
multiplied, and finally brought me to the point where I lost all 
taste for the simpler pleasures of Nature; to the point where if 
there was not something exceptional or criminal in the frolics which 
were proposed to me, I could not even feign an interest in them. 
It is likely that when we reach this stage of numbed indifference, 
virtue makes a final effort inside us, whether because in our ex- 
haustion we are so reduced that her voice reassumes its authority 
in the face of our torpor, or because, through a natural desire 
for change, we, bored with crimes, wish to try a little of the con- 


Juliette & 549 


trary; whatever the case may be, this is the moment, beware of it, 
when long-forgotten prejudices reappear, and if they overtake 
somebody who has already traveled far in a vicious career and 
gain the upper hand over him, the unhappiness they cause is 
terrible; there is nothing worse than to limp back to Susa in defeat 
and dishonor. 

I had just attained my twenty-second year when Saint-Fond 
broached another of his execrable schemes to me. Still infatuated 
with his depopulation measures, his aim in the present plot was to 
starve two-thirds of France to death, by engrossing foodstuffs, 
grains chiefly, on a colossal scale; and in the execution of all this 
I was to have the principal role. 

I—yes, I confess it: corrupt to the core though I was, before 
the idea I shuddered; O thou, the fatal start I gave, what wert thou 
not to cost me! Little impulse, why could I not have suppressed 
thee ?—Saint-Fond caught it with his searching eye. He turned 
and went away without a word. 

I watched him go and, when the door was shut and the sound 
of his footsteps died away, waited there yet a certain while; then, 
for it was late, retired for the night. Long did I lie awake; once 
fallen asleep I had a troubling dream: in it I saw a fearful figure 
putting a torch to my belongings—to my furniture, to my house, 
to everything I owned: all was afire and in the midst of it a 
young creature stretched forth her arms to me . . . sought desper- 
ately to save me, and in the attempt perished herself in the flames. 
I awoke all asweat, and consciousness brought back to me the 
sorceress’ prediction: when vice doth cease, thus had she spoken, 
woe shall betide. O Heaven, I cried in my heart, I stopped being 
vicious for a fleeting instant, I shuddered at a proposed horror; 
misfortune is about to engulf me, it is sure. The woman I saw in 
my dream, she is the sister, the unregenerate and sad Justine with 
whom I fell out because she was bent on taking the virtuous way; 
virtue appeals to me, and in my heart vice falters. . . . Fatal 
prognostic . . . and you who could explain it to me and tell me 
what I should do, you disappear just when my need for your advice 
is greatest. ... I was still at grips with these lugubrious reflections 
when, unannounced, a stranger enters my bedroom, tenders me a 
note, and forthwith steals away. I recognize Noirceuil’s hand: 


550 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“You are ruined,” it reports to me, “never would I have 
expected frailty in her whom I formed and whose conduct hereto- 
fore has been flawless; seek not to repair the want you have ex- 
hibited of zeal: it is too late: your impulse betrayed you, and add 
not insult to injury by supposing the Minister can be further 
duped. Leave Paris before this day is out; take with you the money 
you may have by you; count not upon anything else. Everything you 
have acquired through Saint-Fond’s largesses and aid is forfeited; 
he is a powerful man, this you know, you also know his wrath 
when he has been failed: so do not tarry, go. And go with lips 
sealed: you will not outlive an indiscretion. I leave you the ten 
thousand livres a year you have from me, your drafts will be 
honored anywhere. Now fly, and to your friends say nothing.” 

A bolt of lightning: would have smitten me less cruelly; but 
dread of Saint-Fond affected me even more strongly than despair. 
I rise hurriedly from my bed; having deposited all my valuables 
and all my savings with Saint-Fond’s notary, I dare not go reclaim 
them. I ransack drawers, turn purses inside out: five hundred 
louis is all I can assemble, all I have left. I make several rolls of 
the notes and hide them upon my person, and then, alone, on foot, 
in the middle of the night I go quaking out of this house where 
yesterday I dwelled like an empress, this house upon which I cast 
one last backward glance, tears in my eyes. ... Whither shall I go? 
To see Clairwil. . .. But no, it has been prohibited; and moreover 
is it not she who has betrayed me? is it not she who wishes to 
usurp my place? Ah, how unjust we are rendered by misfortune, 
and how wrong I was, is you shall soon see, in rushing to suspect 
the best friend I had. 

Come now, take hold of yourself, let’s not rely for help upon 
anybody but ourselves . . . I’m still young, I said to myself, it’s 
merely a question of starting afresh; I have learned from my 
youthful errors. .. . O fatal virtue! thou tricked me once; never 
fear, I’ll never again come under thine execrable sway. Only one 
fault have I committed, only once have I slipped, and it was an 
infernal impulse to probity that tripped me. Let’s now snuff it out 
forever within us, virtue is man’s mortal enemy, capable of pro- 
curing him nothing but his doom; and the greatest mistake which 
can be made in a completely corrupted world is to want to put up 


Juliette 2 551 


a lonely fight against the general contagion. And, great God, how 
often have I told this to myself! 

Without anything like a definite plan in mind, concerned only 
to escape the vengeance of Saint-Fond, I jumped, as though 
mechanically, into the first public carriage I found; it was the 
mail-coach for Angers; in due time I arrived there. Never having 
been in this city before, not knowing a soul there, I decided to rent 
a house and to open it for gaming: the nobility from all the 
countryside around soon came flocking to me. . . . Countless lovers 
made their declarations; but the air of modesty and reserve I 
affected quickly persuaded my suitors that I was not to be wooed 
successfully save by him who would make my fortune. A certain 
Comte de Lorsange, the same by whose name I still go today, 
looked to me to be more assiduous and a great deal richer than 
the others: he was then forty years of age, pleasing of face and 
figure; and from his manner of expression I was convinced his 
intentions were loftier and more legitimate than his competitors’ : 
I heeded his attentions. It was not long before the Comte confided 
his designs to me: a bachelor, enjoying an income of fifty thousand 
livres a year, having no near relations, he, if I were to prove 
worthy of his hand, would prefer to have me inherit his wealth 
than have it passed on to some distant kin; and if I were willing 
to be frank with him, to describe my life in fullest detail, omitting 
nothing, he would wed me and accord me twenty thousand a year. 
A proposal such as this was too fair not to accept at once; it was 
a complete confession the Comte must have, it was a complete 
one he got. 

‘Listen to me now, Juliette,” spoke up Monsieur de Lorsange 
once I had terminated my recital, “the avowals you have just made 
me evidence an openness I admire; she who owns her sins so can- 
didly is far nearer to never sinning again than she who has been 
faultless all her life; the former knows what to expect—and the 
latter may at any time fall prey to the desire to essay something 
new. Deign to listen to me a little, Madame, I insist that you do, 
to me your conversion would be a precious thing, I want to guide 
you into the righteous path; I do not propose to upbraid you in a 
sermon, no, but to put certain truths before you, truths your pas- 


552 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


sions screened long from your sight, and which you will always 
find in your heart whenever you wish to inspect it alone. 

“Oh, Juliette! he who was capable of telling you that morals 
are useless in the world set for you the cruelest trap into which 
it would be possible to snare you, and he who was then able to 
add that virtue is futile and religion a fraud might better have 
assassinated you there and then, and been done with it. Killing 
you outright, he would have caused you only an instant’s suffering; 
instead, he readied you for griefs and woes beyond number; the 
misuse of words and the twisting of meanings were responsible 
for all your errors, let us now strive to make a just analysis of 
this virtue wicked teachers sought to make you hate. That which 
is called virtue, Juliette, is constant fidelity in the fulfillment of our 
obligations toward others; I ask you now, what person can be so 
thoughtless, so unfeeling as to venture to situate happiness in that 
which shatters all the ties that bind us to society ? Does that person 
brashly fancy, will he delude himself into believing, that he can be 
happy all alone when he hurls everybody else into distress? Will 
he be strong enough, powerful enough, audacious enough to succeed, 
single-handed, in resistinz the will of society, strong and powerful 
and audacious enough to compel every individual will to make way 
before the irregularities of his own? Is he so bold as to imagine 
he alone has passions? And if all the others have them as surely 
as he, how can he hope to cow the rest into putting theirs into 
abeyance and serving his only? You will agree with me, Juliette, 
no one but a madman can entertain such ideas; but even supposing 
he is ceded to, is he sheltered from the law? Does he doubt but 
that its blade will cut him down as it would another? Will you 
place him so high up that he is hindered by none of these checks? 
Very well; he must still contend with his conscience. Nay, Juliette, 
believe me, nobody ever escapes from that terrible voice: you have 
seen it for yourself, you have had the experience: you attempted 
to slay the conscience in you by imposing silence upon it, and 
instead, more imperious than your passions, it called them to a halt. 

“Instilling in man a taste for society, the unknown Being who 
shaped him had necessarily to give him, simultaneously, a taste 
for the duties whereby he could comfortably maintain himself 
therein; now, virtue consists precisely in the fulfillment of these 


Juliette % 553 


duties; virtue is hence one of man’s primary needs, it is the sole 
means to his felicity on earth. Oh, in what lucid and stately order 
religious truths proceed from these fundamental verities, and how 
easy it is to prove the existence of a Supreme Being to the man 
of virtuous heart; the sublimities of nature, Juliette, those are the 
virtues of the Creator, as benevolence and humaneness are those 
of His creatures, and from the relationships knitting them all up 
together is born the concord of the universe. God is the center of 
the supreme wisdom whereof the human soul is a ray; the moment 
you close yourself up against that divine light, your lot upon earth 
must be to wander in darkness from error to misfortune; cast your 
glance upon those who have presumed to formulate different prin- 
ciples and analyze their motives coolly; did they desire anything 
else than to seduce you and abuse your good faith? Were they 
animated by any other intentions than to flatter their despicable 
and dangerous passions? And in addition to deceiving you, they 
deceived themselves; there is the worst of it, there is what never 
enters into the wicked man’s calculations; to get himself one pleas- 
ure he loses a thousand, to pass one happy day he destines himself 
to a million dismal days; such is the contagion of vice that he who 
is attacked by it wishes to infect everyone around him: the mere 
sight of virtue is a reproach to him, and the wretch does not realize 
that all his efforts to annihilate it become triumphs for it; the 
delight of the evildoer is to do worse every day; but having done 
the worst, then he must stop, and is not this the moment which, 
revealing his limitations, reveals his weakness to him, and _ his 
fault? But is it likewise with virtue? The more he improves its 
delights the more delicate they become, and if he would attain 
virtue’s farthermost limits, he finds them in the bosom of God, 
with Whom he unites his existence to live eternally in bliss. 

“Oh, Juliette, manifold and deep are the joys of virtue and 
religion! I have lived like other men—yes, it is in a pleasure-house 
I have had the fortune of your acquaintance; but even in the 
flings of my youth, even in the fiery noon of my hot-blood days, 
virtue never lost its beauty in my eyes, and it was in discharging 
the duties she imposes I always found the sweetest of my satis- 
factions. Come Juliette, be honest with yourself, how are you able 
to think there is greater charm in causing the tears of distress to 


554 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


flow than in relieving the miserable in their hard plight? I am 
willing enough to grant you, for the sake of discussion, that there 
may be souls so depraved as to allow a delight in the first case: 
do you believe it can compare with the delight produced in the 
second? That which is excessive, that which affects for a brief 
instant only, must it nor seem poor indeed beside a pure, mild, 
and enduring pleasure? The hatred and the curses of our fellow 
man, can they outvalue his love and blessings? O! immoral and 
warped spirit, are you immortal, are you unimpressionable? do you 
not drift like us upon this. peril-strewn sea of life, and have you not 
our own need of rescuers the day you drive upon a rock? think you 
men will heed your cal] after you have insulted them? and do 
you think yourself a gocl, to be able to dispense with men? Only 
grant me these first principles, and how easily I shall lead you 
from love for the virtues to belief in the Being who combines 
them in the ultimate degree. . . . Oh, Juliette, what is the atheist’s 
dreadful quandary! Do but contemplate the beauties of the uni- 
verse, do only that and you will realize the necessity of its Divine 
Author’s existence; it is pride in his passions that prevents vain- 
glorious man from recognizing his God. He who has done a guilty 
deed is wont to doubt the existence of his judge; is readier to deny 
Him than to fear Him, finds it more consoling to say There is no 
God than to have to dread the retribution of Him he has outraged; 
but banishing these deceiving prejudices, let him glance impartially 
at nature, he will discover God in all the infinite art of nature’s 
Author. Ah, Juliette, theology is a science for the vicious only; 
it is the voice of nature for the man whom virtue animates: the 
image of the God he worships and serves, he would be sore 
troubled if virtue’s consolation were but a fable; yes, the universe 
bears everywhere throughout it the stamp of an infinitely powerful 
and industrious Cause; and chance, the paltry and unsure resource 
of dishonest thinkers, that is to say, the fortuitous concurrence of 
necessary and irrational causes, could not have formed anything; 
the Supreme Being acknowledged, how abstain from the worship 
that is His due? Is not our homage owing to that which in all the 
world is most sublime? He from Whom all our joys derive, is He 
not entitled to our thanks? And at this point how soon I shall be 
able to convince you that of all the world’s creeds, the most 


Juliette. 2% 555 


reasonable is the one you were born into. Juliette, if you love virtue, 
you shall quickly come to love the wisdom of the Divine Author 
of your religion; consider the sublime morality that characterizes 
it, and say, was there ever an ancient philosopher who preached 
one so pure, so beautiful? Self-interest, ambition, ulterior motives 
lie back of all those other ethical systems, only Christ’s is based 
upon love of mankind: Plato, Socrates, Confucius, Mohammed 
seek reputation and followers; the humble Jesus awaits only death, 
and his death itself is an example.” 

I listened to that sensible man. . . . Good heavens! said I to 
myself, this must surely be the angel Durand alluded to, and 
these the incomprehensible truths that were to be divulged to 
me... and I pressed the hand of this new-found friend: tears 
were gathering in his eyes, he hugged me gently to his breast. ‘‘No, 
my Lord,” said I, hanging my head, “‘I do not feel worthy of the 
happiness you hold out to me. . . my sins are too many, my fate 
cannot now be reversed.” 

“Ah,” he replied, ‘how. little you know of virtue and of the 
mighty God whence it emanates! never was entry into His fold 
denied the repentent; implore the mercy of the Lord, Juliette, 
implore His forgiveness and your prayers shall be heard. Vain 
formulas, superstitious practices—ah no, I require none of this 
of you; it is faith, it.is virtue, it is your behavior as manifested 
in all the things you do which may ensure the happiness of the long 
life you have yet to live. They who have loved you only for your 
vices, because their own found stuff there to feast upon, they spoke 
to you in no such terms as I have used; nobody but the friend 
of your soul would take it upon himself to address you thus, and 
you will pardon these effusions, they stem from my ardent desire 
to see you happy.” 

Needless to say, my friends, Monsieur de Lorsange’s pretty 
little diatribe persuaded me of nothing unless it was his innocence 
and striking inaptitude as a controversialist. For indeed, what 
grossly inadequate means were these for swaying someone whom 
the habit of logic had by now rendered inaccessible to prejudice 
or superstition, and what more ludicrous than to establish the 
necessity of virtue to human happiness—and this for my benefit! 
Virtue, eh! Whence came all my misfortunes if not from my 


556 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


weakness in having listened to it for one accursed instant; I ask 
you next whether Lorsange’s captious induction could impress 
anyone with a head on iis shoulders. If virtue is proven necessary, 
said he, then religion is equally necessary; my informant’s con- 
struction of lies piled cn bigotries collapsed the moment its bases 
were undercut. Ah no, said I to myself, virtue is by no means 
necessary, it is merely t.armful and a menace—have I not found it 
out from fatal experience !—and all the religious fairy tales they 
seek to found upon virtue can only rest, like it, upon basements of 
absurdity, selfishness is the sole law of Nature; well, virtue con- 
tradicts selfishness, since it consists in the incessant sacrifice of one’s 
leanings and preferences in the interest of the welfare of others: 
if, as Lorsange argues, virtue’s existence proves God’s, what sort 
of God is this that perches atop a system raised upon Nature’s 
deadliest foe? Oh, Lorsange, your whole edifice crumbles of itself, 
and you have built on nothing solider than sand. Virtue is of no 
advantage to man, and the God you establish thereupon is the 
absurdest of all absurd phantoms; man, created by Nature, should 
heed none but the impulses he receives directly from her; his mind 
once freed of confusing prejudices and his vision clear, his natural 
understanding will discover neither any necessity for God nor any 
virtue either. Howeve:, pretense is obligatory here, my situation 
demands it; I must get me out of the mire and back onto the road 
of prosperity, Lorsan;ze’s hand is indispensable to that end; so 
let’s seize it, and never mind the rest; let guile and treachery be 
the weapons I place Leaviest reliance upon, the weakness of my 
sex dictates the choice of them, and my individual principles must 
make them the basis of my character. 

My skill as a liar, acquired over long years of practice, was 
such that I could dissemble with ease and success in any circum- 
stances whatsoever, I put on the appearance of espousing Lor- 
sange’s point of view and counsels; I ceased receiving people in 
my house, each time he called on me he found me alone, sewing, 
and so wonderful was the progress he was making toward the 
salvation of my soul that I was soon noticed at Mass. Lorsange 
tumbled happily into the trap; the twenty thousand /ivres’ annuity 
was written out to me and the marriage contract signed a mere six 
months after I had first set foot in the city of Angers. As I was on 


Juliette & 557 


good terms with the neighborhood, and as my former errors were 
known to nobody there, Monsieur de Lorsange’s choice was gen- 
erally applauded and I saw myself mistress of the finest house 
in town. Hypocrisy restored to me an affluence which dread of 
crime had stripped me of not long before; and here again stood 
vice at the top of the tree. Oh, my friends, say what they will, 
it shall ever be so until humanity’s final hour. 

There is little I can relate touching my conjugal pleasures 
with Monsieur de Lorsange; of these the good man was acquainted 
with none but the most banal; as untaught in lubricity as in philos- 
ophy, during the two dreary years I spent as his wife, the poor 
devil never once took it into his head to vary his routine: soon 
suffocating from the monotony of it, I put out a watchful eye to 
see whether this city might not have something in the way of 
satisfactions to offer. | had no particular requirements as to sex 
and, provided it gave signs of imagination and verve, the object 
could be of any sort. I was long in searching; the strait and strict 
upbringing one encounters in the provinces, the moral rigidity, 
the mediocrity of the population, that also of its means, every- 
thing complicated my efforts, everything posed an obstacle to my 
pleasures. 

A young thing of sixteen, very pretty, the daughter of one 
of my husband’s oldest friends, was the first I attacked. Caroline, 
intrigued by the originality of my remarks, suborned by the im- 
morality of my systems, quickly yielded to my desires: one day 
when we had gone bathing together I made her discharge in my 
arms. But Caroline, who was only beautiful, might well once have, 
but could hardly hold someone who, like myself, had to be roused 
through the imagination; whereof the dear child possessed none 
at all. Brief was our idyll; I shortly found somebody else, aban- 
doned her for a third. Yes, attractive women did not entirely lack 
in Angers, but how dull were their minds—never a hint of frisk- 
iness. Oh, Clairwil, how longingly I thought on you, how greatly 
you were missing to my happiness! Useless to deny it, he who loves 
vice, who since childhood cherishes it either from taste or from 
habit, he, I say, is invariably more apt to find felicity in the con- 
tinual practice of depraved customs than will he who comes late to 


558 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


them after having alwavs plodded along the desolate path of 
virtue. 

I tried men, met with hardly better luck; I was on my tenth 
when one day, while hearing Mass beside my virtuous husband, 
I thought I recognized in the celebrant a certain Abbé Chabert 
with whom I had had some agreeable connections at the Sodality 
of the Friends of Crime-—a charming boy, you often see him here 
today. Never had Mass seemed so tedious; it finished at last. 
Monsieur de Lorsange ‘eaves; some supplementary prayers are 
my excuse for remaining behind. I request a word with the priest 
who has just officiated; he comes: why, my God, yes, it was 
Chabert. We removed at once into a secluded chapel; and there 
the amiable Abbé, after having congratulated himself upon this 
stroke of good fortune and expressed his delight at seeing me 
again, told me that large benefices he possessed here and there in 
the diocese compelled him to keep under cover but that I should 
not be misled by his smirks and antics, bowing and scraping are 
enjoined to politics and cannot be avoided; that his way of thinking, 
views, and habits were quite what they had always been, and that 
he would be only too happy to give me proof thereof at the first 
convenient opportunity. [ for my part recounted what had befallen 
me; having arrived in Angers but a week before, he had not known 
of my presence there, and reiterated his desire that we amply 
renew our acquaintance. 

“Abbé,” said I, “need we delay? Fuck me here and now. The 
church doors are shut, this altar will serve as our couch; make 
haste, reconcile me with pleasures over the loss of which I weep 
every day. Will you believe it? Ever since I came to this wretched 
town, not one of the persons to whom I have surrendered has so 
much as thought to look at my ass, I who cherish none but those 
attacks, and who behold all other pleasures as necessarily accessory 
or incidental to that one.” 

‘Why, very well then, let us indulge in it,” said Chabert, 
turning me so that my belly was resting against the altar, raising 
my skirts from behind. “Ah, Juliette,” cried he after a moment 
spent admiring my buttocks, ‘‘your ass is still the same, Aphrodite’s 
own.” 

The Abbé inclines, he kisses it; ’tis most inspiring to feel, in 


Juliette 559 


my asshole, this tongue where a god lay of late . . . he soon re- 
places it by his prick, and lo! I am sodomized to the balls. And so 
these were the delights of backsliding! Ah, good my friends, my 
pleasure was beyond description; it is cruel to interrupt sinful 
habits, it is heavenly to resume them. During my enforced ab- 
stinence from this kind of pleasure I had felt the most violent need 
of it, this had manifested itself in the form of itchings so keen, so 
insistent that to soothe them I had had to resort to scratchings and 
scrapings with whatever instrument lay ready to hand; Chabert 
gave me a new lease on life. Remarking the extreme pleasure he 
was affording me, he prolonged it to the utmost, and the rascal, 
young and vigorous as he was, hung in my bum until he had spat 
three discharges there. 

“There’s no substitute for it, it has no equal—there’s my 
opinion,” said he as he withdrew. ‘‘Or do you not agree ?” 

“Oh, Abbé Chabert, can you ask such a question? And of the 
staunchest defender of sodomy you are likely to meet in all your 
life ! We must see each other often, my dear.” 

“We shall, Juliette, heaven be my witness, we shall. And I 
would that you were doubly content at having encountered me 
again.” 

‘What do you mean?” 

“T have friends.” 

‘And, you wag, you intend to prostitute me to them?” 

“With attributes and proclivities like yours, you are better 
suited to the role of a whore than the one you are enacting at 
present.” 

‘Abbé, I am touched by what you say, it is a mark of recog- 
nition. Tis a sad part to play in the world, that of an honest wife; 
the title itself implies stupidity. Every chaste wife is mad; or else 
a fool who, lacking the strength to shake off her prejudices, re- 
mains buried beneath them through witlessness or because of some 
constitutional flaw, and is hence nothing better than a creature 
Nature mismade or contrived in jest. Women are built for im- 
pudicity, born for it, and those of them who remain prudes through- 
out and in spite of all are fit only for ridicule and scorn.” 

Chabert knew my husband and described him as a bigot; he 
urged me to seek:some compensation for the austerities of the 


560 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


marital couch. Having overheard someone say that Monsieur de 
Lorsange was to depart the next day for one of his estates, he 
advised me to take advantage of his absence to come to a country 
dwelling of his whither he would escort me, and partake in a 
replica of our Parisian debauches. 

“Tis a wicked thing you are doing,” said I, rallying the 
Abbé, “you are unsettling all my plans for virtue. Say now, is it 
right for you to flatter my passions? should you thus pave for 
me the way to crime? ought you lure his wife away from a husband? 
Ah, your conscience will answer for it; it is time you halt your 
wicked machinations. The harm is not yet done, I have but to con- 
sult a spiritual guide less perverted than you, he will teach me how 
to resist such criminal desires; he will show me that they are the 
product of a perverse soul, explain to me that, in submitting to 
them, one dooms oneself to eternal remorse, to remorse of the very 
bitterest as there are evil deeds for which there is no possible 
reparation. He will not. like you, advise me that I am at liberty 
to do anything, that I have nothing to fear; he will not encourage 
me to wild conduct by raising hopes of impunity, he will not facili- 
tate my journey into adultery and sodomy, he will not cheer me on 
to betraying my husbarid—a gentle, God-fearing husband, wise, 
pious, good, who sacrifices himself for his wife. . . . Oh no, no, it 
will be the contrary of that, he will trundle out the great terrors of 
religion, he will brandish them to affright me; like the virtuous 
Lorsange, he will remind me of a dead God who died for the sake 
of my salvation;”” he will make me sense how guilty I am in dis- 
regarding such favors... . But I shall not attempt to conceal it from 
you, my dear Abbé Chabert, she who is today no less a libertine, 
no less a scoundrel thar: you knew me to be in the past would be 
mightily prone to take such pratings ill; and in reply to his golden 
words, tell him: My friend, I abominate religion, to the devil with 
your fuck-in-the-ass God and a fig for your advice: gibber to me 
no more, clumsy little oaf, virtue offends me, it’s vice I like; and 
it is to enjoy myself Nature put me on this earth.” 


17 A dead God! Nothing so droll as this incoherent term out of the Catholics’ 
lexicon. God means eternal; dead means noneternal. Blithering Christians, what do 
you propose to do with your dead God? 


Juliette & 561 


“Ah, Juliette,” said Chabert as we parted, “‘wrong-headed as 
ever, and just as engaging. Here in this solitude and bleakness 
where we live, ’tis a treasure I have found in finding you.” 

I arrived punctually at the rendezvous, Chabert and I set off 
for his retreat; apart from ourselves, there were gathered four 
men and four women. Among the latter were three with whom I had 
held voluptuous commerce previously; while the four men were 
carnal strangers to me. The Abbé gave us merrily and plentifully 
to eat and drink, and we gorged ourselves on libertinage too. The 
women were pretty, the men vigorous: my ass was fucked by all the 
men, my cunt fingered, sucked by all the women. I discharged pro- 
digiously. No need to describe that party to you, nor the eight or 
ten others which followed it during my stay at Angers. You are 
weary of lubricious descriptions, and henceforth I shall spare you 
all but those which exceptional crimes or other singularities render 
worthy of your hearing. 

Before advancing with my story I must mention a few vital 
details which cannot longer be omitted. Eleven months after my 
marriage to the Comte de Lorsange I presented him with a charm- 
ing baby girl; bearing the child was a struggle for me, but shrewd- 
ness won out in the end. The measure was essential: I had to con- 
solidate my claims to the fortune of the man who had given me 
his name. I could not do this without a child—but was it fathered 
by my virtuous husband, that’s what you are wondering, isn’t it 
now, prying busybodies that you are? Why then, allow me to make 
you the same reply Madame de Polignac made to Monsieur in 
answer to the same indiscreet question: “Oh my Lord, when one 
ventures into the midst of a thicket of rosebushes, how is one 
to tell by which thorn one has been pricked?”’ But do you suppose 
Lorsange bothered to inquire? He accepted everything, jibbed at 
nothing; the honor and the burdens of paternity devolved upon 
him, did my greed require anything more? This little daughter, 
whom my husband named Marianne, was completing her first year 
and I my twenty-fourth when, taking deep and long counsel with 
myself, I decided I had no alternative but to leave France. 

From anonymous correspondents I had received warnings 
that Saint-Fond, whose star was only continuing to rise at the 
Court and who was in apprehension of a damaging indiscretion 


562 <<» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


from me, regretted not having clapped me away into a place of 
safety, and that he was having me sought after everywhere. Fearing 
lest my change of name and condition prove insufficient camouflage, 
I resolved to put the Alps between the Minister’s hatred and me: 
but there were ties binding me, they had to be dissolved; could 
I make my escape so long as I was under a husband’s thumb? Here 
was something that hac. to be remedied and I began to lay my plans. 
The great deal I had already accomplished in this domain reduced 
a rather unimportant crime to a mere trifle in my eyes; meditating 
it moistened my cunt, I hatched my plot to the tune of acute spasms 
of joy, and prospects of others goaded me toward its speedy 
execution. I had half a dozen pinches left of each poison bought 
from Durand: to my tender spouse I administered a strong dose of 
the royal variety, both out of respect for his aristocratic person, and 
because the time whict was to elapse between the envenoming and 
the death of the beloved would screen me from all possible sus- 
picion. 

Never was there a sublimer death than that of Monsieur de 
Lorsange; his acts and sayings were elevated, they were exemplary ; 
his bedchamber turned into a chapel where sacraments of all sorts 
were celebrated continually. He exhorted me, he preached to me, 
he bored me; recommended to me the little daughter he thought 
was his; and hemmed in by three or four confessors, breathed his 
last. Truly, had all that dragged on another two days, I believe 
I would have left him to die all by himself. The respect and care 
allegedly due to the dying: comprise another social obligation which 
makes no sense to me. One ought undoubtedly to take the fullest 
possible advantage of a living creature; but as.soon as Nature, 
afflicting it through maladies, advises us that she has initiated the 
process of reclaiming that creature, rather than risk infringing 
her laws we must let her operations take their course; we may 
hasten them, yes; but interfere with them, never. In short, the sick 
must be abandoned to their own devices; place a few objects inside 
their reach that may bring them relief, if you like, then proceed 
about your business. It is unnatural for a healthy individual to go 
and breathe, before his appointed time and in open violation of 
Nature’s intentions as they regard him, the contaminated air of 
a sickroom, and to expose himself to falling ill too, all in order 


Juliette & 563 


to do something unlawful: nothing being more criminal in my 
opinion than to venture to force Nature to desist or retreat; and 
always acting according to my principles, I may assure you that I 
shall never be seen nursing the sick, nor comforting them in any 
way whatsoever. Nor do I wish to be told that it is my harshness 
of character which is responsible for this attitude of mine; it 
comes from nowhere but my intelligence, and my intelligence rarely 
deceives me where the issue is philosophical. 

My very chaste husband interred, I went gladly into mourning 
for him: no widow, I am told, was ever so becoming in her weeds, 
wherein I had myself fucked on the burial day—in Chabert’s com- 
pany it happened; but even more delicious than wearing those 
lugubrious tires was to become the owner of four fine estates 
evaluated at fifty thousand livres a year in rents, plus the one 
hundred thousand francs in specie I found in my husband’s coffers. 

More than enough here for my Italian journey, said I, trans- 
ferring the bundles of banknotes from the deceased’s moneybox 
into mine, and there’s the hand of fate, friendly to crime as always 
and crowning it once again in bestowing her blessings upon one 
of crime’s most devoted disciples. 

It turned out that Abbé Chabert had traveled in Italy and 
was able to furnish me a quantity of glowing letters of recommenda- 
tion. In exchange, I left my daughter in his wardship; he promised 
to take the very best care of her—my concern for the child was of 
course motivated by material considerations rather than by any 
motherly affection, there being neither any place in my heart for 
such a sentiment, nor any justification for it in my beliefs. For 
lust-objects I took along only a tall, well-shaped, and pretty lackey 
by the name of Zephyr, to whom I had frequently played Flora, and 
one chambermaid, Augustine, eighteen years of age and heavenly 
to behold. Accompanied by these two trusty individuals, by another 
woman of no consequence, some baggage, and my well-filled treas- 
ury, I boarded a coach and without stopping save for the night and 
for meals, sped at a merry clip all the way to Turin. 


“And so here I am at last,” said I, drawing deep breaths of 
free air, ‘‘in this so interesting region of Europe, this Italy that has 


564 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


always attracted the curious, here am I in the home of Neros and of 
Messalinas; perhaps upon this hallowed soil they used once to 
tread I shall capture the spirit of those paragons of crime and 
debauchery, and be able to duplicate the atrocities of Agrippina’s 
incestuous son and the lubricities of Claudius’ adulterous wife.’’ The 
idea prevented me from sleeping that night and I spent it in the 
arms of a pretty young lass at the Albergo d’Inghilterra, where I 
had taken lodgings—a clelicious creature whom I had managed to 
seduce an hour after alighting, and in whose fresh embraces I 
tasted perfectly divine pleasures. 

No city in all Italy is more regular nor duller than Turin; 
the courtier is tiresome there, the townsman doleful, the rabble 
equally hangdog and also superstitious and devout. Very slender 
resources for pleasure, moreover; setting forth from Angers I had 
struck upon a properly libertine scheme, meditated upon it en route, 
and at Turin I began its execution. My idea was to travel in the 
guise of a celebrated courtesan, to make broad display of myself 
everywhere, to enhance my fortune with the tribute exacted by my 
charms, and in the interests of my libertinage to exploit whatever 
of youth and vigor fell irito my clutches. On the day after my arrival 
I had word carried to Signora Diana, the most famous furnisher 
in Turin, that an engagirig young Frenchwoman was in town and for 
hire, and that I would be obliged if she would come to discuss 
arrangements with me; the procuress did not fail to answer the 
call, I outlined my plans to her, and declared that between fifteen 
and twenty-five they could have me for nothing where I had guaran- 
tee of sound health; that I took fifty Jouis between twenty-five and 
thirty-five; one hundred from thirty-five to sixty; and two hundred 
from sixty to the final point of human senescence; that as regarded 
fantasies, occult requirements, and the like, I satisfied them all, 
that I even lent myself to fustigations. 

‘And the ass, my fair lady,” Signora Diana interrupted me, 
“and the ass? For it is in hot demand here in Italy; you will 
earn more money by your ass in the space of a single month than 
you will from four years of selling your cunt.” 

I assured Diana that I was very easy in this article, and that 
in consideration of a double fee no bid for the use of it would be 
refused. I did not have to wait long before being presented. It was 


Juliette * 565 


the very next day that a message from Diana advised me I was 
expected for supper at the residence of the Duke of Chablais. 

After one of those voluptuous toilettes whence nature emerged 
embellished by the cunning hand of art, I betook myself to the 
house of this Chablais, then forty years of age and renowned 
throughout the entire country for his libidinous studies in venereal 
pleasures. The Duke had one of his sycophants by him, together 
they promptly explained to me that in the games to follow I would 
play the dummy. 

“Get yourself out of all this array,” said the Duke, conducting 
me into a very elegant chamber, “art so often being a mask to 
defects, our policy with women, my friend’s and mine, is to lay 
them bare at the outset.” 

I obeyed. 

“One ought never wear a stitch when one has a body so fair,” 
my two assailants observed. 

“Frenchwomen are all alike,” the Duke went on to remark, 
“their figure and skin are delicious, we have nothing comparable 
here.” 

And the libertines inspected me, in their survey turning me this 
way and that but nevertheless concentrating their attention upon 
certain details and in a certain manner that soon gave me to sus- 
pect that it was not without reason Italians are charged with a 
predilection for the charms unappreciated by Monsieur de Lor- 
sange. 

“Juliette,” announced the Duke, “I had better tell you that 
before you come to grips with us you shall make show of your 
talents upon some young boys, they will be admitted into the room 
one at a time. Station yourself upon this couch if you will; the lads 
we have in store for you shall, as I say, enter in single file by this 
door to the right and march out that other door to the left; as each 
arrives, you will frig him with all the skill your nationality prom- 
ises, for nowhere on earth do they know how to frig pricks better 
than in France; just prior to discharge you will steer them first the 
one toward my friend’s mouth, then the next toward mine, that is 
where they are to deposit their fuck; after this, and once again tak- 
ing turns, my friend and I shall embugger them before sending 
them on their way; as for you, your individual services shall not 


566 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


be required until we have had our fill of these inaugural delights, 
and you shall only then be informed of your remaining duties, with 
the fulfillment of which these lewd scenes will close.” 

Immediately after the Duke finished speaking the parade be- 
gan: all the youths I had to frig were either fourteen or fifteen 
years old, and every one of the thirty I handled was as pretty as 
a star. They all discharged, some for the first time in their life; 
the two friends, frigg ng themselves throughout, swallowed the 
fuck loosed by each and bum-stuffed them all from the first to the 
last: one friend would hold the patient, the other would joust five 
or six minutes in his bowels; neither ejaculated. When the tourna- 
ment was over both were in such a fever and rage that sweat lay 
on their brows and foam upon their lips. 

‘Your turn now,” shouted the Duke, “‘ ’tis you, beauteous god- 
dess come to us from France, who are about to receive the incense 
warmed within this crowd of charming little boys; it would be 
idle to expect your anus to be as narrow as theirs, but that may 
perhaps be mended.” 

And they moistened my asshole with an alcohol essence 
whereof the effect was such that when they fell to sodomizing me 
they had literally to blast and batter their way in; one after the 
other they stormed the fort, one after another they discharged 
inside it, exhibiting incredible marks of satisfaction; six small 
boys surrounded them while they toiled: two gave their asses to be 
colled, they frigged two more, one with either hand, and the other 
two ass-sucked and ball-tickled them from below and behind. The 
Duke and his satellites left; I remained in the room, recovering my 
breath and stanching my wounds. A woman came to fetch me, 
helped me dress, and took me back to my lodgings after having 
counted me out a round thousand sequins. 

Be of good cheer, said I to myself, my promenades in Italy 
shan’t cost me much, I have but to find a similar windfall in each 
city I visit and not only will I defray my expenses, I will keep 
Mademoiselle de Lorsange’s dowry intact. 

Ah, but the life of a public whore is not all a bed of roses; 
however, having of my own free will resumed the profession, it was 
only just that together with its profits I also accept its liabilities. 
But we are yet a long way from coming to its perils.

A God-fearing man though he is, the King of Sardinia loves 
libertinage. Chablais had reported to him upon our interview, His 
Highness was eager to see me. Diana reassured me; it amounted 
to no more than receiving several clysters administered by the 
royal hand, and ejecting them for His Majesty’s amusement while 
frigging Sardinia’s noblest prick; for this two thousand sequins 
would be mine. Curious to see whether sovereigns discharged like 
other men, I accepted the King’s invitation. And he accepted the 
humble role of being my apothecary; I flushed six injections into 
his mouth; and as I frigged him hard and fast, he discharged hot 
and happy. He then offered me half his cup of breakfast chocolate, 
I thanked him graciously. We chatted of politics. The privileges 
conferred upon me by my nationality and sex, those I had just now 
acquired through my performance, my native frankness, every- 
thing conspired to put me at my ease, and according to my best 
recollection here as follows is the speech I made that morning 
to the little despot: 

“Estimable gate-keeper of Italy, you who descend from a 
house whose rise constitutes a true miracle of policy, you whose 
ancestors, mere commoners and goatherds in olden times, became 
puissant lords simply by according right of passage through your 
States to princes from the north bent on conquest in Italy, a per- 
mission your forefathers only granted in exchange for a share in 
their booty; you, first of Europe’s kinglets, deign to lend me your 
ear a moment. 

“Perched high in your mountains like the crag-haunting eagle 
awaiting a dove to devour, you are coming to realize that in such 
a position as you keep, you depend utterly not only for your ad- 
vancement but for your mere subsistence upon the folly of courts 
or the mistaken maneuvers of crowned dizzards; this, I am well 
aware, is what they were telling you thirty years ago; but there have 
been vast changes wrought in the system since then: the folly of 
courts now risks to be as much to your disadvantage as to their 
own, and those mistaken maneuvers can no longer bring you any 
profit; so give up your scepter, my friend, give Savoy up to France, 
and retire within the narrower boundaries Nature prescribed to you 
originally: see those superb peaks towering over in the west, the 
hand that created them, does it not prove to you, in piling them up 


568 <%& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


so high, that your sway is not to extend beyond them? what need 
have you to reign over soil that is French, you who are unable 
even to reign in Italy? Have a care there, my friend! perpetuate 
not the race of kings; we already have overmany of those useless 
individuals in the world, who, fattening on the substance of the 
people, vex and bully them under the pretext of governing them. 
In our day there is nothing more superfluous than a king; renounce 
that empty title before it is gone too far out of fashion, step down 
from your throne now, voluntarily, before, as may well happen, 
you are dragged forcibly off it by the people whose eyes are be- 
ginning to tire of its height. Philosophical and free men are ill- 
disposed to see above them a man who, carefully considered, and 
impartially, has no more than ordinary needs, strength, and merit; 
for us, the anointed of the Lord is not a sacrosanct personage 
anymore, and today wisdom laughs at a little fellow like you who, 
because he has some of his forebears’ parchments stored away in 
some box, fancies himself empowered to rule over men; your au- 
thority, my friend, no longer. reinforced by periodical lootings, 
presently rests upon nothing solider than opinion: let opinion 
change—it is very near to doing so—and we shall go looking for 
you amidst the hod carriers in your empire. 

“And think not thz.t much is lacking before the change comes 
about; as men grow steadily more enlightened they begin to ap- 
praise critically what formerly dazzled them: well, the likes of you 
do not benefit from scrutiny. The rumor begins to go about that a 
king is nothing but an ordinary human being; and that, softened 
by luxury, warped by despotism, there is not a single monarch on 
earth with the qualities requisite for his post. The first virtue de- 
manded of anyone who wishes to be a ruler of men is knowledge of 
them; and what a distorted picture of them must he not have who, 
perpetually: stunned and fuddled by their flatteries and living all 
his life at the greatest remove from them, has never been able 
to sift nor scan them? It is not tucked away in a bower of bliss 
that you learn how to lead your fellows. He who has never been 
anything but fortunate, understanding nothing of the needs of the 
fortuneless, he is not the man to guide the destinies of a nation 
made up of woe-ridden individuals; Sire, heed my advice: throw 


Juliette & 569 


away your royal baubles, go back to your plow, there’s nothing 


else left for you to do.” 
Taken somewhat aback by my outspokenness, His Majesty’s 
only reply was some cajolery of that very false stamp which is the 


hallmark of everything that comes out of a true-born Italian’s 


mouth; and we bade each other Adieu. 

That same evening I was introduced into a rather brilliant 
circle where, around a gaming table, I saw society grouped in two 
distinct classes: there were the rogues on the one side and the 
dupes on the other: I was informed that the practice in Turin was 
to steal at play, and that a man could not pay addresses to a woman 
until he had let himself be robbed by her. 

“Why, that’s an amusing custom,” I said to the gambler who 
was acquainting me with the situation. 

“The explanation is perfectly simple,” she continued; ‘‘gam- 
bling is a form of commerce, hence all ruses are lawful in it. Do you 
hail a shopkeeper before the magistrates because ‘the curtains in 
his window filtered the light and led you to mistake shoddy wares 
for good? It has only to succeed and any means for acquiring 
wealth is proven sound, Madame; this one is no worse than 
another.” 

I remembered Dorval’s maxims on theft, and decided they 
were altogether applicable to this variety of it. Of my informant I 
asked how one might go about perfecting oneself in this manner 
of plundering the property of others, assuring her that I had a 
thorough understanding of most of the rest. 

“There are masters,” she replied, “I shall send you one to- 
morrow if you like.” 

I begged her to do so; the teacher appeared, and in the space 
of a week he had given me enough instruction in the management 
of cards to enable me to collect two thousand /ouis during the three 
months I stayed at Turin. When the time came to pay for his 
lessons, he requested nothing but my favors; and as it was a V’itali- 
enne he must have them, and as that style suited me infinitely, 
after a close examination of his state of health, a precautionary 
measure which cannot be foregone in that country, I let him take 


570 e& ‘THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


his pleasure in the fashion appropriate to a man whose trade is in 
treachery. 

Sbrigani, that was my mentor’s name, had in addition to an 
engaging appearance a very creditable prick; no more than thirty 
years of age, sound in wind and limb, of polished gesture and 
pretty speech, a libertine mind, a philosophical temper, and an 
astounding gift for appropriating anything belonging to others in 
every conceivable way. It at once occurred to me that such a man 
could be useful to me in the course of my travels; I proposed that 
we join forces; he accepted. 

In Italy, regardless of the capacity in which a man accom- 
panies an actress, singer, or other strumpet, there is never any- 
thing repulsive in the fact for those who pay her suit: the brother, 
the husband, or the father usually withdraws when the customer 
appears on the thresholcl; does the latter’s ardor seem to flag, the 
kinsman shows himself again, enters into conference with you both, 
and if, after this, Signor’s spirits look to be rising a little, retires 
into the clothes closet; it is understood that Signor supports the 
household, he therefore has its support; and the Italian, accommo- 
dating by nature, falls in wonderfully with this arrangement. As 
by now I knew enough of the tongue spoken in this splendid coun- 
try to pass for a native, I straightway assigned Sbrigani the role 
of my husband, and we started forth on the road to Florence. 

We proceeded at a leisurely pace; we had no cause to hurry, 
and I was well pleased to contemplate a land which, if one could 
but traverse it without seeing human beings, would answer one’s 
idea of heaven, We lay tke first night at Asti, This city, prodigiously 
fallen from its ancient grandeur, is hardly anything at all today. 
On the morrow we resumed our way and went no farther than 
Alessandria; Sbrigani having assured me that this town was reputed 
for the large number of nobility among its population, we decided 
to spend several days there and see what dupes might be found. 

As soon as we would arrive somewhere, my husband issued a 
kind of clandestine but nonetheless very effective proclamation by 
which those who had the wherewithal to purchase my charms were 
provided a general description of them and some indication of their 

rice. 
y The first to present himself was an old Piedmontese duke, ten 


Juliette 571 


years retired from the court; he wanted no more, said he, than to 
view my ass. For this pleasure Sbrigani charged him fifty sequins; 
but, heated by the prospect, the duke shortly demanded more. Ever 
the submissive wife, I announce that I can consent to nothing with- 
out my husband’s approval; no longer in any state to undertake 
a serious attack, the duke manifests a desire to whip. This fad 
is one of the chief consolations of one-time buggers; it is agreeable 
to outrage the god into whose temple one can no longer push 
one’s way; Sbrigani sets the figure at a sequin a blow and fifteen 
minutes later I have three hundred coins in my-purse. From his 
Lordship’s‘spendthrift manner my husband deduces that here is a 
man to be dunned, inquires into all his concerns, and beseeches him 
to accord his wife the honor of supping with her. Greatly puffed 
up by this request, the old courtier feigns indecision for a moment, 
then allows himself to be prevailed upon. 

“Magnanimous and revered favorite of Italy’s greatest 
prince,” says Sbrigani, introducing him to Augustine, whom we have 
told what is afoot, “the time has come for blood to speak, now 
must Nature stir in your soul; recollect the affair you once had, in 
Venice, with the lovely Signora Delfina, married to an aristocrat of 
second rank. Behold it, Excellency, you see standing before you the 
fruit of that liaison. Agostina is your daughter; embrace her, my 
Lord, she is worthy of you. ’Tis I who formed her from childhood 
and tell me now, have not my efforts been successful? I feel that I 
may rightfully boast of having turned her into one of the prettiest 
and cleverest creatures in Europe. Excellency! Great has been my 
desire to meet you, far and wide have I sought you out: overhearing 
that you dwelt at Alessandria, I hied myself hither, for I wanted 
to see it with my own eyes. Aye, 'tis so, the resemblance cannot be 
doubted; so here you are, good my Lord, and I trust you will re- 
ward me for my pains and have some kindness to show a humble 
Italian who for all his wealth has nought else but the beauty of 
his wife.” 

Augustine’s slender waist and willowy figure, her big brown 

eyes and the exceeding fairness of her skin made a powerful im- 
pression upon the duke; and the allurements of incest contributing 
their heavy share to his joyous anticipations, after a few explana- 
tions, a few answers perfectly provided by Sbrigani, the poor duke 


572 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


assured us of his emotion, declared he recognized Augustine, and 
meant to take her home that very instant and assign her the rank 
she deserved to have in his family. 

“Softly, softly,” said my illustrious spouse, “your Excellency 
has his dinner to digest. And I would remind him that the girl is 
mine until I have been reimbursed for the immense costs I have 
incurred on her account, ten thousand sequins would hardly cover 
them. Nevertheless, in view of the honor you have so graciously 
done my wife, I cannot higgle with your Lordship and will be con- 
tent with that paltry sun; Sire, pray tell it out forthwith, else I'll 
not be able to let Agost na leave my house.” 

The bawdy duke was also rich and to his dazed consideration 
for so pretty a piece of merchandise as this no price could be too 
high; the transaction was concluded between cheese and dessert and 
after coffee my chambermaid went off with her alleged father. 
Thoroughly instructed in what she was to do, the dear girl, speak- 
ing Italian as fluently as I and equally unbackward where it was 
a question of raiding other people’s property, was not long showing 
her mettle. We had gone: to wait for her at Parma; a fortnight later 
she joined us there and recounted how the duke, head over heels in 
love with her, had begun his wooing of her the very first night. 
The more she harped on the relationship which forbade such an 
intrigue, the hotter the cld rake had waxed, pointing out to her that 
such fussiness and splitting of hairs simply wasn’t the practice in 
Italy. More at ease in his own house, better able to employ the 
assistance of third persons or the restoratives he apparently had 
not dared resort to when visiting me, the libertine acquitted himself 
more honorably; and Augustine’s charming ass, after having been 
stoutly lashed, had ended up being fucked. The sweet child’s ex- 
treme docility had so inflamed the poor duke that he had over- 
whelmed her with presents and given her his entire confidence. 
Entrusted also with all the keys to all the locks, she had rifled the 
treasury and decamped; and she closed her narration by producing 
something over five hundred thousand francs. As you may readily 
imagine, after such a capture we did not tarry overlong in the 
neighborhood, although it ought to be said that we were hardly in 
any great danger. For in Italy one has but to cross into the nearest 
province when one runs afoul of the law: the authorities of one 


Juliette & 573 


state cannot prosecute you in another; and better yet, as adminis- 
trations change every day, often twice a day, the crime you com- 
mit before dinner is too old to punish by nightfall—all this is of 
clear convenience to travelers who, as was the case with us, are 
eager to wreak havoc along the way. 

However, discretion being the better part of valor, we made 
a judicious departure from the states of Parma and did not stop 
till we were come to Bologna. The beauty of the women in that cify 
forbade me from proceeding farther before having my fill of them; 
Sbrigani, who catered to me marvelously and whom I fairly 
covered with gold, presented me to a widow of his close acquaint- 
ance. This charming creature, thirty-six years old and as lovely 
as Venus in her prime, knew every sapphic personality in Emilia: 
in the space of a week I frigged myself with better than seven- 
score women, each more attractive than the other; we spent a 
second week in a celebrated abbey not far outside the town, whither 
my guide was in the habit of making periodic pilgrimages. Oh, 
_ my friends! the power even of an Aretino’s pen would be insufh- 
cient to describe the inconceivably lewd revels we organized in that 
holy retreat; all the novices, a goodly number of nuns, fifty pen- 
sionnaires, one hundred and twenty women all told, passed through 
our hands; and I may affirm that never in my life had I been frigged 
as I was there. The Bolognese nun possesses the art of cunt-sucking 
in a higher degree than any other female on the European con- 
tinent: she flits her tongue with such enchanting celerity from cli- 
toris to vagina, and from vagina to asshole, that though she must 
momentarily quit the one in order to reach the other, it seems as 
if she were everywhere at once; her fingers are of an amazing 
flexibility and deftness, and she does not leave them idle with her 
sisters. ... Delicious creatures! I shall ever sing your memory, and 
never forget your charms nor your matchless skill in awakening 
and maintaining voluptuous titillations; nor shall I forget your 
cunnirfy refinements; and my most lubricious moments shall be 
those during which I recall to mind the pleasures we tasted to- 
gether. They were all so pretty, so fresh and gay, that choosing 
among them was impossible; if at any point I endeavored to con- 
centrate upon one, that multitude of beauties would distract my 
attention and the ensemble would reassert its claim to my homage. 


574 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


It was there, my friends, that I executed what Italian women call 
the rosary: all fitted out with dildoes and gathered in a great hall, 
we would thread ourselves one to the next, there would be a hun- 
dred on the chain; through those who were tall it ran by the cunt, 
by the ass through those who were short; an elder was placed at 
each novena, they were the paternoster beads and had the right to 
speak: they gave the signal for discharges, directed the movements 
and evolutions, and presided in general over the order of those 
unusual orgies. 

Mesdames soon cevised another fashion for giving me 
pleasure ; here, all activities centered upon me: I was laid out upon 
a group of six, with whose voluptuous undulations I sweetly rose 
and fell, and all the res: came forward by the half-dozen to con- 
sult my sensations and s ake them with lubricity: one had me suck 
her cunt, my two hands were busy palpating two more; another, 
straddling me, frigged herself upon my nipples, yet another rubbed 
her clitoris against my face; they all discharged, all washed me in 
their sperm; and you must not suppose I was reluctant or miserly 
in the release of mine. 

Finally, I besought them to embugger me; a cunt was applied 
to my lips, I drank of its whey; this cunt, drained, was replaced 
by another each time a new dildo penetrated into my fundament; 
my guide, the widow, had the same done to her, but cuntwise, and 
*twas an assshe fed from. 

While I. was off rioting at the abbey, Sbrigani devoted himself 
to replenishing our fund:s, seriously depleted by my wild spending; 
by the time I returned he had accomplished the last of a series of 
six robberies and entire.y repaired the damage my extravagance 
had caused. Happy is the man who learns to settle his expenditures 
and fill the gaps in his own fortune solely by using the fortunes of 
others. 

This was in the extent of between two and three thousand 
sequins; we were able to leave Bologna about as rich as we had 
come. 

I was exhausted; but since the excesses of libertinage, as they 
weary the body, only heat the imagination further, my thoughts 
were taken up with planning a thousand new debaucheries; I re- 
gretted not having done more, and in search of an explanation for 


Juliette 2% 575 
my failure could only suppose that it was owing to some mental 
sluggishness on my part: and it was then I discovered that the re- 
morse one may suffer for not having gone to the limit in crime is 
superior to anything that afflicts feeble spirits for having strayed 
away from virtue. 

Such was my physical and moral state as we were crossing the 
Apennines. This vast mountain chain dividing the peninsula along 
its length holds much of interest for the inquiring traveler; as the 
road rises, the most extraordinary prospects greet the eye: on the 
one side stretches the great Plain of Lombardy and on the other 
lies the Adriatic Sea; a spyglass enables one to see to a distance of 
fifty leagues. 

We dined at the wayside inn at Pietra Mala, with the intention 
of visiting the volcano. Profoundly devoted to all the irregularities 
of Nature, adoring everything that characterizes her disorders, her 
caprices, and the gigantean horrors whereof she gives us renewed 
examples every day, I had of course to observe this phenomenon; 
and so, after a meal that was poor despite our policy of always 
sending a cook ahead of us, we set out on foot across the little 
stretch of blasted terrain at whose farther end the crater is situated. 
The zone surrounding it is a waste, uncultivated and littered with 
pebbles and stones; the temperature of the air mounts as one moves 
toward it, and one breathes the stench of copper and carbon the 
volcano exhales; by and by we caught sight of the flame whose heat, 
curiously enough, was intensified by a fine rain which happened 
then to start to fall: the fire pit seemed about thirty or forty feet 
in circumference: strike a spade into the earth anywhere near it, 
and fire springs up from the ground at that spot... . 

“It is,” said I to Sbrigani, who stood contemplating this 
wonder beside me, “‘it is like my imagination igniting under the 
strokes of a lash applied to my ass.” 

The earth inside that furnace is baked, charred, black; that in 
its vicinity is like clay, and impregnated with the volcano’s odor. 
The flame soaring from the pit comes out in an intense gush, it 
burns and instantly consumes anything tossed into it; its color is a 
violet blue, like the color of burning brandy. To the right of 
Pietra Mala is another volcano which only bursts into flame when 
fire is brought near its edge; nothing so amusing as the experiment 


576 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


we made: by means of a candle we set the whole plain afire. With 
a mind like mine such things had best never be seen, yes, my friends, 
I must agree to that; but the candle I touched to the ground set it 
alight less quickly than the poisonous vapors arising from the place 
were intoxicating my brain. 

“Oh, my dear,” said I to Sbrigani, ‘“‘Nero’s wish is becoming 
mine. Did I not foresee that from breathing that monster’s native 
air I would soon adopt his penchants ?” 

When rain fills the crater of that second volcano with water, 
this water boils away in steam, and this steam is cool—O Nature! 
impenetrable and strange are thy ways and beyond the imitation of 
mortals.... 

It is to be feared that the many volcanoes ringing Florence 
may someday cause it hz.rm: these fears are amply justified by the 
signs of past upheavals one notices everywhere in the area. They 
suggested some comparz.tive ideas to me: is it not very probable, 
said I to myself, that the fiery destructions of Sodom, Gomorrah, 
etc., made up into miracles for the purpose of instilling in us a 
terror of the vice which held universal sway among the inhabitants 
of those cities; is it not altogether likely that the famous conflagra- 
tions were caused, not by supernatural agencies, but by natural 
forces? The region surrounding Lacus Asphaltites, where Sodom 
and Gomorrah lay, was studded with imperfectly extinct volcanoes; 
the country there was similar to what it is here. From the geographi- 
cal parallel I moved on ‘o the parallel of climate; and when I saw 
that at Sodom as at Florence, at Gomorrah as at Naples, and in 
the vicinity of Etna as in that of Vesuvius, the population cherish 
and adore nought but buggery, I came swiftly to conclude that the 
irregularity of human behavior is closely related to Nature’s own 
caprices, and that wherever Nature is depraved she also corrupts 
her children.’ Wherewith I imagined myself transported to those 


18 An important question «atses itself here; literary minds, it seems to us, are 
peculiarly qualified for an attempt to settle it, and that is why we venture to propose 
it as a subject for their earnest consideration. Does moral corruption in a people 
come from the flabbiness of their government, from their country’s physical location, 
or from the excessive size of the population clustered in their urban centers? Not- 
withstanding Juliette’s contentions, moral corruption does not depend upon location, 
since there is as much moral disorderliness in the northern cities of London and 
Paris as in the southern cities of Messina and Naples; weak rule would not appear

happy Arabian towns, here I am in Sodom, I said, let us do here as 
the Sodomites do; and poised on the brink of the crater, bending 
forward over its edge, I presented my bare buttocks to Sbrigani 
while next to me Augustine and Zephyr imitated us; we changed 
partners; Sbrigani drove full length into my waiting maid’s pretty 
ass, and I became my valet’s prey; and while our men toiled in our 
bowels, Augustine and I gazed dreamily into the pit and 
masturbated. 

“This is indeed a charming pastime I find you at,” we suddenly 
heard declared in a cavernous voice which seemed to issue from 
behind a bush. ‘‘No, no, carry on, carry on, I do not wish to spoil 
your pleasures, only to take a hand in them,” went on this species 
of centaur who, as he emerged from hiding and drew near, proved 
to be of proportions and aspect which exceeded anything we had 
ever seen in all our life. Seven feet and three inches tall, with, 
behind huge moustaches, a face both swarthy and awful; we 
wondered for a moment whether it were not the Prince of 
Darkness who was hailing us. Surprised at our alarmed stares, 
“What!” cried he, “have you not heard of the Hermit of the 
Apennines?” 

“Certainly not,” Sbrigani replied, ‘“‘we have never heard tell of 
the likes of you!” 

“Why, then, come along with me, all four of you, and you 
shall behold more wonderful sights yet: the business I discover 
you engaged in leads me to suspect that you deserve to see what I 
have to show you, and to partake in it too.” 

“Giant,” said Sbrigani, ‘“‘we are fond of extraordinary things, 
and to witness them there is doubtless nothing we would be unwill- 
ing to do; but your tremendous strength, might it not be exerted 
to the detriment of our liberty ?” 

‘No, because I judge you worthy of my society,” said this 


to be the cause either, since as regards these matters the law is much more severe 
in the north than in the south, without that preventing the disorder from being 
the same; no, we are driven to the conclusion that moral corruption, whatever be the 
terrain or the regime, results from nothing but the too heavy concentration of too 
many individuals within a small area; that which masses compactly degenerates; and 
every government that would avoid corruption within its borders must curb the 
growth of population and, above all, break large groups into smaller to preserve the 
purity of their constituents.

singular personage; ‘“‘but for that, your fears would be fully author- 
ized. Lay them aside, however, and follow me.” 

Determined indeed to learn what this adventure held in store 
for us, we sent Zephyr to tell our entourage to wait for us at the 
inn until we reappeared there; Zephyr returned from his errand, 
we set forth, the giant in the lead. 

“Have patience,” our guide told us, “the road is long but 
seven hours of daylight remain and we shall arrive before the 
veils of night overspread the heavens.” 

We walked in total silence, for the giant would have it so; 
during that march I was able to give all my attention to the 
landscape. 

Leaving the volcanic plain of Pietra Mala we climbed for 
an entire hour the slope of a high mountain lying to the right; from 
the pass we finally reached we gazed into an abyss a full two 
thousand fathoms deep, and it was down into it our winding path 
led, through a forest that quickly grew so dense, so dark, we were 
scarce able to see the way. After three hours of nearly perpendicu- 
lar descent we came to the edge of a lake; on an isle in its center 
was to be seen the donjon of the castle where our guide had his 
abode, of which only the roof could be made out owing to the lofty 
battlements girting it. We had been some six hours coming this far 
and during that time we had espied not a single house, not a single 
individual. A black bark, like a Venetian gondola, was moored to 
the shore; from there we could take in the tremendous bowl at 
whose bottom we were: it was rimmed all around by towering 
mountains whose flanks were covered by forests of pine, larch, and 
green oak, and ended in barren peaks and snow: words cannot 
convey to what extent that scene was wild and lonely and for- 
bidding, nay, unearthly. We stepped into the boat, the giant fer- 
ried us to the island. His castle lay two furlongs back from the 
water; we arrived before an iron gate set in the thick outer wall; 
spanning a moat twenty feet wide was a drawbridge which was 
raised once we had crossed over it; here was a second wall, again 
we went through an iror: gate, and found ourselves in a belt of trees 
so close-spaced that we had indeed to force a passage between 
them, and beyond this enormous hedge was the castle’s third en- 
closure, a wall ten feet thick and without any gate at all. The giant

stoops and lifts a great stone slab no one else would have been able 
to budge; thus does he uncover a stairway; we precede him down 
the steps, he replaces the stone; at the farther end of that under- 
ground passage we ascend another stairway, guarded by another 
such stone as I have just spoken of, and emerge from dank dark- 
ness into a low-ceilinged hall. It was decorated, littered with 
skeletons; there were benches fashioned of human bones and 
wherever one trod it was upon skulls; we fancied we heard moans 
coming from remote cellars; and we were shortly informed that 
the dungeons containing this monster’s victims were situated in the 
vaults underneath this hall. 

“IT have you in my power,” he said once we had sat down, “I 
can do with you what I please. Do not, however, be alarmed; the 
acts I saw you in the midst of performing convinced me that here 
were kindred spirits such as would merit my hospitality. Supper 
is being prepared, between now and the time it is ready let me tell 
you a little about myself. 

“I am a Muscovite, born in a small town on the Volga bank. 
Minski is my name; upon my father’s death I inherited his colossal 
riches and Nature had proportioned my physical faculties and my 
tastes to the favors wherewith fortune now gratified me. Sensing 
myself made for better things than to vegetate in the back country 
of an obscure province like this that was my birthplace, I traveled; 
the whole wide world seemed too narrow for my desires, they were 
limitless and the universe cramped them: born libertine and im- 
pious, debauched and perverse, bloodthirsty and ferocious, I visited 
a thousand far-flung lands to learn their vices, and no sooner 
adopted one than I refined it. I began with China, the Mongolias, 
and Tartary; I journeyed throughout all Asia; swerving north 
again I passed by way of Kamchatka and entered America by the 
famous Bering Strait. In that extensive part of the world I so- 
journed practically everywhere, by turns in its politer societies, by 
turns among its savages, copying none but the crimes of the former, 
the vices and atrocities of the latter. Sailing east, to your Europe I 
brought back penchants so dangerous that they condemned me to 
the stake in Spain, to be broken on the wheel in France, hanged in 
England, drawn and quartered in Italy; wealth is a guarantee 
against anything. I crossed over to Africa; there I became most 


580 el THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fully aware that what you so foolishly call depravity is neither 
more nor less than the natural state of man and its particular 
details usually the result of the environment into which Nature 
has cast him. Those noble children of the sun laughed at me when 
I rebuked them for their barbarous treatment of women. ‘And 
what do you suppose a woman is,’ they would reply, ‘if not a 
domestic animal Nature gives us for the double purpose of satisfy- 
ing our needs and our desires? What better claim to our considera- 
tion has she than the ca:tle and swine in our barnyards? The only 
difference we see here,’ those sensible people would tell me, ‘is that 
our livestock may merit some indulgence thanks to their mildness 
and docility, whereas women merit harshness only, in view of their 
congenital and everlasting dishonesty, mischievousness, treachery, 
and perfidy. We fuck them, don’t we? and is there anything. better, 
indeed, is there anything else you can do with a woman you have 
fucked than use her as you do your ox or a mule, as a beast of 
burden, or kill her for food ?’ 

“In a word, it was there I observed man in his constitutionally 
vicious, instinctively cruel, and studiously ferocious form, and as 
such he pleased me, as stch he seemed to me in closer harmony with 
Nature, and I preferrec| these characteristics to the simple crude- 
ness of the American, to the knavery of the European, to the 
cynical depravation of the Oriental. Having killed men on the hunt 
with the first, having drunk wine and lain with the second, having 
done much fucking with the third, I ate human flesh with my brave 
African comrade; I have preserved a taste for it; all this wreckage 
you see around you are relics of the creatures I devour; I eat no 
other sort of meat; I trust you shall enjoy tonight’s feast, there will 
be a fifteen-year-old boy on the table. I fucked him yesterday, he 
should be delicious. 

‘After ten years wandering abroad I returned for a visit to 
my native land, where I was greeted by my mother and sister. 
Loath to tarry in Muscovy and resolved, once I had left it, never 
to set foot there again, this seemed the propitious moment to put 
a final order in my affairs. I raped and massacred them both in the 
same day: my mother was still a handsome woman, of impressive 
stature; and though my sister was only six feet tall, she was cer- 


Juliette & 581 


tainly the superbest creature to be found anywhere in the two 
Russias. 

“Then with an income amounting to roughly two million a 
year I made straight for Italy with the intention of settling here. 
But for surroundings I wanted something unusual, rustic, little 
frequented, and where I could indulge my wanton imagination; and 
its caprices are not mild, my friends, as I believe you shall have 
opportunity to perceive during these next few days as my guests; 
there is not a single libertine passion my heart does not cherish, not 
a piece of wickedness that has failed to amuse me. If I have not 
committed more crimes, it is for lack of occasion; I need not re- 
proach myself for having neglected a one, and I have provoked all 
those which were laggardly in presenting themselves. Had I with 
greater luck been able to achieve twice as much, I would have that 
many more happy memories; for those of crimes are delights which 
cannot be too numerous. From this introduction you shall probably 
take me for a villain; the things you. are going to witness in this 
house shall, I trust, confirm you in that opinion. You guess my 
palace large; it is huge, in it are lodged two hundred boys, aging 
from five to sixteen, who commonly pass from my bed to my 
kitchen, and about the same number of young men whose job is to 
fuck me. I have an infinite fondness for that sensation; in all the 
world, I maintain, there is none so sweet as to have your ass given 
a vigorous scraping while you busy yourself at some other distrac- 
tion, whatever it may be. The pleasures I observed you tasting of 
late on the volcano’s rim prove that you share my liking for this 
fashion of fuck-shedding, and that is why I permit myself this open 
manner of speaking with you; were it not for that, I would simply 
butcher you. 

“I have two harems: the first contains two hundred girls from 
five to twenty years old; when by dint of lewd use they are sufh- 
ciently mortified, I eat them. Another tenscore women of from 
twenty to thirty are in the second; you'll see how they are treated. 

“Fifty servants of both sexes look after this considerable 
store of pleasure-objects; and for purposes of recruitment I have 
one hundred agents posted in all the large cities of the world. And 
yet, with all the movement this entails, the only access to my 
island home is by way of the trail you came along today, no one 


582 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


would ever believe it is constantly being utilized by perfect caravans, 
and the security in which all this is accomplished will never be 
violated. Not, mind you, that I have the slightest reason for 
worrying ; we are here in the territories of the Duke of Tuscany; 
the whole extent of my irregular doings is known in his circles, and 
the silver I scatter about protects them from undue publicity as well 
as from interference. 

“To round out this portrayal of myself, I had best provide 
some details touching my more intimate person: I am forty-five, 
and at this age my lubricious faculties are such that I never retire 
for the night without hzving discharged ten times. True enough, 
such inordinate quantities of human flesh as I consume heavily con- 
tribute to the plentifulness and density of the seminal matter ; who- 
ever tries this diet is certain to triple his libidinous capacities, to 
say nothing of the strength, the health, the youthfulness such fare 
assures ; nor do I speak cf its unique amenities, I need only tell you 
that you have but to taste it once and you will have a stomach for 
nothing else; no other flesh, whether of fish or fowl or animal, can 
withstand the comparison. One has merely to overcome an initial 
aversion; after that it is fair sailing, one never tires of man. Since 
it is my hope that we shall discharge together, it is essential that 
you be forewarned of the appalling symptoms which distinguish 
my crisis: dreadful outbursts herald and accompany it, and the jets 
of sperm thereupon released mount to the ceiling, often in the 
number of fifteen or twenty: the repetition of pleasures has never 
left me dry so far, my tenth ejaculation is just as tumultuous, just 
as abundant, as the first. nor have I ever found myself tired and 
out of sorts today because of last night’s efforts. As regards the 
member whence all that comes, here it is,” said Minski, hauling 
forth a pike eighteen inches long by sixteen in circumference, sur- 
mounted by a crimson knob the size of a military helmet. ‘Aye, 
here it is: behold its state, it is never in any other, even as I sleep 
at night, even as I walk in the day.” 

“Oh, good heaven!’ I cried upon seeing that instrument. “But, 
my kind host, you kill as many women and boys as you see—”’ 

“Just about,” the Muscovite replied to me, “and as I eat 
what I fuck, that spares me the wages of a butcher. . . . Much 
philosophy is needed to understand me, yes, I realize it, I am a 


Juliette & 583 


monster, something vomited forth by Nature to aid her in the 
destruction whereof she obtains the stuff she requires for creation; 
I am without peer in abomination, alone in my kind . . . oh yes, all 
the invectives they gratify me with, I know them by heart; but 
powerful enough to have need of nobody, wise enough to find 
sufficiency in my solitude, to detest all mankind, to brave its censure, 
to jeer at its attitude toward me; experienced enough, intelligent 
enough to explode every creed, to flout every religion, to send every 
god to hell for the devil’s fucking; proud enough to abhor every 
government, to refuse every tie, to ignore every check, to consider 
myself above every ethical principle, I am happy in my little do- 
main; in it I dispose of all a sovereign’s privileges, in it I enjoy all 
the pleasures of despotism, I dread no man, and I live content; I 
have few visitors, indeed none unless in the course of my outings 
I encounter persons who, like you, strike me as philosophers enough 
to take part in my amusements awhile; such people only do I invite 
to my home, and I meet with few; thanks to my natural vigor, I 
am apt to rove very far on those excursions, not a day goes by but 
I make:a twelve-league, sometimes a fifteen-league sally forth from 
here—” 

‘And hence some captures,” I interrupted. 

“Captures, rapes, burnings, murders, whatever the criminal 
chances happen to be I exploit them to the full, because Nature 
endowed me with a propensity for every crime and the means for 
committing them all, and because there is none I do not cherish and 
that does not afford me sweetest joy and make me glad in my 
heart.” 

“And justice ?” 

‘Inexistent in this country; that is why I chose it for my 
domicile in the first place: with money, you do anything you like 
here, and I spend a lot.”* 


19 The far less inconvenient way would be for the state to allow persons of con- 
dition to do ail they wished in return for money and to buy absolution for every 
crime; better this, surely, than to have them die on the scaffold. The latter measure 
is of no profit to the government; the former could easily become an important source 
of revenue, yielding funds to cover all sorts of unforeseen expenses which are met 
today by levying countless taxes: these are onerous to innocent and guilty alike, 
whereas what I propose distributes the burden equitably, the heavier share of it fall- 
_ing where it fairly belongs. 


584 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Two of Minski’s masculine slaves, evil-looking blackamoors, 
announced that supper was served; they knelt before their master, 
respectfully kissed his balls, then his asshole; and we removed into 
the next room. 

“No special trouble has been gone to on your account,” said 
the giant. ‘‘If all the kings on earth were to come to see me I’d not 
depart one inch from my custom.” 

But some description should be given of that dining room and 
of the accessories in it. 

“The appointments you see here,’ 
they move when the signal is given.” 

Minski snaps his fingers and the table in the corner of the 
room scuttles into the middle of it; five chairs dispose themselves 
around the table, two chandeliers descend from the ceiling and 
hover above the table. 

‘There is nothing raysterious about it,” says the giant, having 
us examine the composition of the furniture from closer on. “You 
notice that this table, these chandeliers, those chairs are each 
made up of a group of zirls cunningly arranged; my meal will be 
served upon the backs of these creatures; my candles are stuck 
into their cunts; and our behinds, yours as well as mine, settling 
into these chairs—they are comfortable—will rest upon the soft 
faces and the elastic breasts of these maidens; wherefor it is I 
pray you lift your skirts, mesdames, and you, messieurs, remove 
your breeches so that, ir: accordance with the words of Scripture, 
‘flesh may rest upon flesh.’ ” 

‘“‘Minski,” I observed to our Russian, “the role assigned to 
these girls is arduous, above all if you are long at table.” 

“The worst that mzy befall,” Minski retorted, “is that it kill 
a couple of them, and such losses are too easily repaired to permit 
me to bother about them for a minute.” 

As we tucked up our skirts and the men climbed out of their 
breeches, Minski demanded a look at our asses; he fondled them, 
he nibbled them, he nuzzled them, and we remarked that of our 
four bums, Sbrigani’s, through a refinement of taste easy to imagine 
in such a person, enjoyed his particular favor; he tongued and 
pumped it for nigh on fifteen minutes; that ceremony ended, we 


’ said our host, ‘‘are alive; 


Juliette & 585 


took our places, bare-skinned, on the bubs and visages of Minski’s 
sultanas, or rather his slaves. 

Twelve naked girls of between twenty and twenty-five brought 
the dishes; and as they were of massive silver and very hot, scorch- 
ing the breasts and buttocks of the elements composing the table, 
there was a pleasant convulsive stir produced, it resembled the 
rippling of waves at sea; above twenty entrees or roast platters 
decked the table, and upon side tables, built of four grouped girls 
each, and which also ambled up at the snap of a finger, were ranged 
wines of every kind. 

‘‘My friends,” said our host, ‘‘as I have already informed you, 
only human flesh is served here; those plates are pure of any other 
ingredient.” 

“We'll try some,” said Sbrigani; “it is absurd to turn up one’s 
nose at anything, aversions are based on nothing better than the 
lack of habit; all viands are fit nourishment for man, Nature offers 
them all to him, and it is no more extraordinary, after all, to eat 
a human than to eat chicken.” 

So saying my husband dug his fork into a joint of boy which 
looked to him especially well prepared and, having carved himself 
a generous two pounds of it, fell merrily to; I imitated him; 
Minski encouraged us; and as his appetite was in the same class 
with his passions, he had soon licked a dozen platters clean. 

He drank the way he ate; he had tossed off his thirtieth 
bottle of Burgundy by the time the second course came on; this he 
washed down with champagne; and Aleatico, Falernian, and other 
rare Italian vintages were swallowed at dessert. 

Yet another good thirty bottles of wine were in our cannibal’s 
guts when, his senses sufficiently enlivened by all these physical and 
moral excesses, the rogue declared that he was now in a discharging 
mood. 

“TI had better not fuck any of you four,” he admitted, “it 
would kill you; but you can at least cooperate in my pleasures, you 
can watch them. The spectacle is rousing. Well now, whom would 
you have me tup?” 

“I want,” said I to Minski, who was bending lewdly over my 
breasts and seemed to be taking a growing interest in me, “I want 


586 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


you to encunt and then to embugger a little girl of seven right here 
in front of me.” 

Minski gestures and the child appears. 

The libertine’s rapings were facilitated by an ingenious con- 
traption; it was a kind of high stool, splay-legged and of iron, 
upon which the victim lay either belly up or belly down, depending 
upon which orifice she was called upon to present; to the stool’s 
four legs the victim’s four limbs were then made fast, who from 
the. position thus assumed offered the sacrificer either a wide-open 
cunt, if she was lying belly up, or a wide-open ass, if she was lying 
belly down. You have ro idea what a pretty little thing she was 
whom the barbarian was preparing to immolate, and you have no 
idea how it amused me, the unbelievable disproportion between the 
assailant and his quarry. Minski rises in a rage from the table. 

“Strip,” he orders, “all of you, off with every stitch. You,” 
he goes on, pointing to Zephyr and Sbrigani, “‘you will bugger-fuck 
me while I am in action, and you,” he adds, fingering Augustine 
and me, “put your asses where I can kiss them side by side.” 

We take up our stances; the child is clapped upon the stool 
and tied belly up to begin with; I do not exaggerate when I affirm 
that the member by which she was about to be perforated was 
thicker than her waist. Minski rattles off a string of oaths, he 
whinnies as animals do, he sniffs the hole; I took pleasure guiding 
that monumental member, no art was employed in the enterprise, 
Nature alone was counted upon for success, and the whore came 
to our aid as she does every time it is a question of an atrocity 
which amuses, serves, or delights her. Three bone-cracking heaves 
and the tool is lodged: skin splits, blood pours, and the little maid 
faints. 

“That’s it, that’s it,” shouts Minski, breathing very hard, 
“good, that’s what I wanted.” 

Oh, my friends! the crime moves toward completion; Minski 
is being bum-stuffed, he kisses, bites, chews now Augustine’s 
buttocks, now mine; a ringing yell announces his ecstasy, he utters 
wild blasphemies. . . . The scoundrel! the rake! Discharging, he 
has strangled his victim, she breathes no more. 

“Never mind,” he says, eyeing the child, “no need to tie her 
this time, she’ll lie still.” 


Juliette & 587 


And flopping her over stone dead as she is, the libertine 
sodomizes her, the while strangling one of the girls who had been 
serving the table and whom he has summoned into reach. 

“Why indeed!” said I when he had unleashed his second 
discharge, “do you then never taste this pleasure without it costing 
some individual his life?” 

“It often costs the lives of several,” the ogre replied. “If I 
had no human beings to kill I do believe I would have to give up 
fucking. For it is death’s sighs answering my lubricity’s that fetches 
forth my ejaculation, and were it not for the death my discharge 
occasions I don’t know how I’d be able to discharge at all. 

“But come with me into the next room,” the Russian con- 
tinued, “‘ices, coffee, and liqueurs are awaiting us.” Turning then to 
my two men, “Friends,” said he, “you fucked me to perfection; 
you found my asshole large, did you? I dare say. But agreeable 
nonetheless? I’m sure of it; the fuck you spattered into it tells me 
so. As for you charming ladies, your asses distinctly delighted me 
and in token of my gratitude, for the next two days I accord you 
the run of my seraglios, enjoy yourselves there, my beauties, they 
are rare facilities I place at your disposition.” 3 

“Liberal host,”’ said I to the giant, ‘“‘we ask no more of you; 
voluptuous satisfactions ought to crown lewd preparations, and the 
rewards of libertinage ought to be earned in the service of lubric- 
i Aus 
" We entered; from the odor reigning in the room we were 
quick to divine of what species were these ices Minski promised us: 
and indeed in each of five white porcelain bowls reposed two or 
three mards, exquisite in form and exceedingly fresh. 

“I always take them after dinner,” the ogre told us, “nothing 
is more helpful to the digestion and at the same time nothing so 
pleases my palate. These turds come from the best asses in my 
harem, and you can eat them safely.” 

“Minski,” I rejoined, ‘‘an appreciation for these dainties is 
slow to come by; we might perhaps fancy them in a moment of 
passion, but you catch us somewhat unprepared—” 

“Just as you like,” Minski replied, picking up a bowl and 
tossing off its contents, “everyone must be his own guide in these 


588 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


matters. Go right ahead with the liqueurs, I shall not be having 
any until after.” 

It was a lugubrious chamber we were in, and the illumination 
typified the rest: four and twenty skulls enclosed each a lamp 
whose light emerged through the eye-sockets and the jaws. Glimps- 
ing my horror, the ogre, his prick high and nodding, made as if to 
approach me; I met him with skill enough to divert his desires 
elsewhere. Young boys were serving our coffee, I had him embugger 
one of them, he was twelve years old and dropped dead off the end 
of Minski’s prick. 

Realizing after a while that in our fatigued condition we 
were no longer able to keep pace with him, Minski had his slaves 
conduct us to a superb gallery where in four mirror-paneled alcoves 
stood the beds we required for rest. A corresponding number of 
girls were under instruction to chase away flies and burn incense 
during our sleep. 

It was late when we awoke. Our attendants led us to the bath- 
rooms where under their expert care we were wonderfully re- 
freshed; and thence to the adjoining conveniences where they had 
us shit in a manner no less comfortable than voluptuous and 
hitherto unknown to us: they dipped their fingers in rose water, 
then inserted them into our anuses; gently and caressingly they 
detached and removed whatever matter they encountered there, but 
so tactfully, so cunningly that you savored all the pleasure of the 
Operation without any of its pain: the vessel once emptied, they 
tongued it clean inside and out, and this with unequaled address and 
dexterity. 

Upon the stroke of eleven a messenger arrived to announce 
that Minski had granted us the honor of visiting him in his bed. 
We entered his chamber; it was spacious, upon the walls were 
magnificent frescoes representing ten libertine groups which for 
composition were probably the highest thing ever attained in ob- 
scenity. At the far end of that room was a wide semicircular apse 
paneled by mirrors and containing sixteen black marble columns, to 
each of which a girl was bound, her rear being exposed to view. By 
means of a pair of cords placed like bellpulls at the head of our 
hero’s bed, he could subject each of those sixteen asses in the dis- 


Juliette & 589 


tance to a different form of abuse, the torture lasting until he 
released the cord. Independently of the girls aforementioned there 
were six others plus a dozen boys, some agents and some patients, 
who remained on hand in nearby antechambers for such night- 
service as their libertine overlord might require. The first thing he 
did as we approached his couch was to show us his erection, putting 
on a horrible-grin as he pointed.that gigantic engine in our direc- 
tion; he demanded the sight of our asses, we complied; while 
palpating Augustine’s, he vowed he would get himself into it be- 
fore the day was out; the poor thing trembled at those words. 
Minski frigged Sbrigani purple and made prolonged ado over his 
buttocks as well; they fell to some reciprocal ass-sucking and ap- 
peared to take great pleasure from that; then Minski asked, would 
we like to see him hurt those sixteen girls tied to the columns, all 
sixteen at one stroke? I urge him to start his machine; he gives a 
tug on his tackle and the sixteen wretches, screaming in unison, are 
simultaneously attacked about the hindquarters in sixteen different 
manners, one is pricked, the next burned, another scourged, yet 
another tweezed, raked, scored, grated, stabbed, slashed, chopped, 
etc., and all that so forcefully that the alcove is drenched in blood. 

‘Were I to pull harder,” Minski explains to us, “and it 
sometimes happens that I do, everything depends upon how things 
stand with my balls, but, as I say, I have merely to pull harder on 
my lanyard and the lot of them are done for; I like to go to sleep 
lulled by the thought that at the bare hint of a desire I can perform 
sixteen murders.” 

‘“‘Minski,” I say to our host, “your supply of women is large 
enough to permit you to make a little sacrifice: it is in my friends’ 
behalf as well as my own I ask you to treat us to this charming 
scene.” 

“I consent,” Minski replies, “but my custom is to discharge 
while operating; this little slut you have in your train, her ass in- 
trigues me—let me sodomize her and the moment my fuck lands in 
the bottom of her bowels you’ll see my sixteen women die.” 

“That will surely make seventeen!” Augustine shrilled, im- 
ploring us not to surrender her to the monster; “how do you expect 
me to endure such an experience?” 


590 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“With patience and understanding,” says Minski. 

And, having his attendants undress her, he engaged her to 
assume the appropriate posture. 

“Have no fear,” he continued, ‘‘no woman has ever resisted 
me and I fuck younger than you every day.” 

Deciding from the Russian’s manner and mien that objections 
would only serve to irritate him further, we dared not even manifest 
our regrets. 

“It’s only a little whim,” Minski whispered to me, “‘it will be 
satisfied in a trice. This girl provokes me, blame it all upon her ass; 
whether I kill her or simply cripple her, it’s the same thing, you'll 
have two other and much prettier ones to replace your loss.” 

As he spoke, two of his serving girls in the room prepared the 
passage, moistening the instrument and guiding it to the hole. 
Minski was so practice in these horrors that he accomplished 
them virtually without effort; two thundering blows sent his mast- 
sized weapon crashing: to the depths of the victim’s ass, and with 
such dazzling speed we hardly saw its length disappear; the 
villain emitted a whoop of delight, Augustirie swooned, and the 
gore ran down her thighs. Minski, in seventh heaven, only waxes 
the hotter; four girls ancl as many boys crowd around him, so well 
trained are they in their duties that not an instant elapses but all 
is ready; Augustine lies somewhere beneath the giant’s bulk, she 
has quite vanished. Her assassin swears, nears the mark, he dis- 
charges, wrenches the cords; sixteen death-dealing devices enter 
simultaneously into play, the sixteen bound creatures scream as one 
and expire at the same time, one with a dagger in her heart, the 
other with a bullet there, this one her brains dashed out, that one 
her throat slit, in short, variously but concurrently. 

“It does appear to me that your Augustine was right,” Minski 
remarked coolly. “Indeed yes, her predictions have been amply 
borne out by the event.” And it was then, as he debuggered, that 
the poor girl’s body came back into sight: it had been pierced in ten 
places by that many thrusts of a dagger. How the scapegrace had 
contrived to manage this without our noticing, and to wring 
Augustine’s neck into the bargain, I have no idea. 

“Oh, I adore strangling them while fucking them,” that ter- 


Juliette 591 


rible libertine owned phlegmatically. “Let’s have no tears, | 
promised you I would give you two prettier ones in exchange and 
I intend to keep my word. . . . There was nothing for it, my friends, 
certain asses have always affected me that way; and when I am 
dealing with pleasure-objects, you understand, my desires are al- 
ways so many death sentences.” 

The duennas dragged my poor Augustine’s corpse into the 
center of the room where the sixteen dead girls already lay; and 
Minski, after surveying this heap, after having handled each of 
the bodies, bitten into a few buttocks and several breasts, designated 
three of them for his kitchen, one of these being the mortal remains 
of our late companion. 

‘“Have them dressed and cooked for dinner,” he instructed his 
head steward. Turning away from the carnage, he invited us to 
follow him into the next chamber for a téte-a-téte. 

At this point Sbrigani caught my eye. His opinion, communi- 
cated to me in a murmur, was that we had perhaps beware of this 
monster and ask to leave the premises as soon as possible. But, I 
said to myself, a request to depart could hardly entail greater risks 
than remaining here; however, upon entering the room Minski 
ushered us into, I was content to put on an aloof air which, convey- 
ing my disapprobation of his late proceedings, allowed him to infer 
how suspicious they had made me touching his designs in my own 
regard. 

“Come, come,” said the ogre, having me sit down on a couch 
beside him, “I am surprised at you, Juliette. For I thought you 
much too much of a philosopher to miss that girl, or to suppose for 
one instant that the laws of hospitality were operative in the house. 
of a man with a soul like mine.” 

“What you have done is irreparable.” 

“Why so?” 

“T loved her.” 

“You loved her! If you are silly enough to love an object 
which serves your lust, why, Juliette, there is nothing more I can 
say: it would be a waste of time hunting for arguments to convince 
you; none exist against stupidity.” 

“Very well then,” I said grumpily, “it isn’t Augustine I am 


592 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thinking about, but myself. I am anxious, I admit it. You will stop 
at nothing. What assurance have I that you will not subject me to 
the same treatment that undid my friend?” 

“None, absolutely none,” said Minski, “and if the idea of 
assassinating you were to harden my prick, you’d no longer be 
among the living a quarter of an hour later. But I thought you were 
as much a rascal as I; in view of our resemblance, I prefer you as 
my accomplice than as my victim. That is also my attitude toward 
the two men in your company: they also look to me fitter to par- 
ticipate actively i in my pleasures than to be the occasion of them: 
your security reposes upon this assumption. And what of Augustine ? 
Ah! a bird of a different feather; I am a good physiognomist : more 
servile than criminal, she complied with your desires, did as she 
was told but was far from doing what she wanted. Oh, Juliette, I 
hold nothing sacred: to have spared all four of you would have 
been at the least to act as though I believed in the laws of hospital- 
ity. The appearance .. . the mere idea of a virtue horrifies me; I 
had to violate those laws, some gesture was required of me; I am 
satisfied now, put your cares away.” 

‘‘Minski, your frankness merits that I reply in the same strain. 
Let me repeat: if I am disturbed by Augustine’s fate it is mainly 
because it causes me concern for mine. You were not mistaken in 
your judgment of me, rest assured that my heart is incapable of 
lamenting any object of .ibertinage; I have sacrificed a fair number 
of them in my life, and I swear to you I have never bewailed the 
passing of a single one.’ 

At this Minski nodded and made as if to rise. ‘‘No,”’ I said, 
praying him to stay a little, “‘you just now began a criticism of the 
virtue of hospitality, I have a liking for principles; intimate to me 
yours on this subject. A’though it has been a long while since any 
virtue has enjoyed my favor, I never took firm measures against 
my notions of hospitality—was it oversight? was it chance? or 
could it be that I harbcred some obscure belief in their sanctity? 
Combat, discredit, destroy, extirpate—speak, Minski, you have 
my ear.” 

“The greatest of all extravagances,” the giant began, plainly 
not displeased to have this opportunity to display his wit, “is with- 
out doubt that which leads us to ascribe a privileged nature to the 


Juliette & 593 


individual who, by accident, through curiosity, or because of need, 
ventures under our roof; nothing but some personal motive could 
ever have induced us into this error. The fault is surely not 
Nature’s: the more entirely a people lives within her law, the less 
it knows of any laws of hospitality; countless savages lure travelers 
into ambushes and then immolate their prizes. In a few degenerate 
and unpolished nations they act differently, eagerly receive their 
visitors; and carry courtesy to the point of availing them of their 
wives and their children of both sexes; let us not be deceived by 
this practice, it too is the fruit of egoism. For the people who so 
behave are seeking support, protection, from the foreigners who 
come among them; recognizing them stronger, better made, or 
better-looking than themselves, they may desire to have these 
foreigners settle in their country, either to defend them or by 
mating with their women to breed an improved race for the regen- 
eration of their society: such are the aims of this calculatedly 
joyous welcome, of this hospitality that seduces fools and which 
fools laud; and which, be persuaded of it, has never emanated from 
any disinterested sentiment. 

“Yet other peoples expect pleasure from the guests they greet, 
and caress them in order to use them; they fuck them. But no 
people has ever exercised hospitality gratuitously: read all their 
histories and you will discover the particular reasons each had for 
receiving strangers generously. 

“And indeed, what would be more ridiculous than to throw 
one’s house open to an individual from whom one expected nothing 
in return? In the name of what is a man under obligation to play 
benefactor to another man? Does the material or moral similarity 
obtaining between two bodies entail the necessity that one of these 
bodies do good to the other? I value a man to the extent he is use- 
ful to me; I scorn him and even detest him when he can be of no 
further service to me; he then having nothing left to show me but 
all that is vicious in him, and being nothing now but a potential 
threat to me, I must deal as warily with him as with a ferocious 
beast that can do me nothing except harm. 

“Hospitality was the virtue preached by the weak: homeless, 
naked, puny, lost, looking elsewhere than to his own industry for 
his welfare, he had of course to advocate a virtue which would 


594 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ready him haven and suppers. But what need has the strong man 
to act hospitably ? Put incessantly to contribution, deriving nothing 
from his philanthropies, how long can he continue to be a host to 
all and sundry before he becomes a fool? I ask you now whether 
any action at all can be honestly reputed a virtue when it is to the 
advantage of only one of the classes of society? 

“And think of the dangers to which they who perform it ex- 
pose the hapless souls they unthinkingly shelter! Accustoming them 
to idleness, they rot what is left of moral fiber in their lazy guests, 
who soon finish by breaking into your house when, your generosity 
exhausted, you cease to open the door to them, just as beggars 
always turn thieves when you finally refuse them alms: well now, 
once you analyze any such action, for what, pray tell me, does it 
reveal itself when on the one hand you detect its inutility and on 
the other its perilous nature? Answer me straight out and unam- 
biguously, Juliette: can you dare transform an action of this sort 
into a virtue? will you not, if you wish to be just, rather rank it 
among the vices? Let there be no mistake about it, the granting of 
hospitality is as dangerous as the granting of charity; all civilities 
that emanate from benevolence—a sentiment originating in weak- 
ness and arrogance—all of them are pernicious, from every imagi- 
nable point of view; and the prudent man, the reasonable man, 
steeling his heart against all these pusillanimous impulses, must 
take every good care to avoid the grim pitfalls into which they 
entice us. 

“The inhabitants cf one of the Cyclades are such enemies to 
hospitality that they go to unusual lengths to keep strangers at 
bay; they dread and loa:he them, so much so that they never accept 
anything tendered them by a stranger without first protecting their 
bare hands with green leaves, and then attaching the object to the 
end of a stick. If despite all precautions a stranger chances to 
touch their skin, they purify themselves immediately, rubbing herbs 
upon the spot. 

“There is no trea:ing with certain Brazilian tribesmen save 
at the distance of one hundred paces, and gun in hand.” 

“The Africans of Zanguebar are so little given to hospitality 


20 See Cook’s account of his second voyage. 


Juliette & 595 


that they pitilessly slaughter all strangers who penetrate into their 
country.”* 

“For centuries the Thracians and the mountaineers of the 
Taurus pillaged and slew all who came to visit them.” 

To this day the Arabs despoil and sell into bondage all 
survivors of disasters at sea who succeed in coming ashore on their 
coasts. 

“Egypt was long barred to foreigners; the government's 
orders were to enslave or kill anyone found along the border or 
within sight of land. 

“In Athens, in Sparta, hospitality was forbidden; those who 
implored it were punished by death.” 

“Arrogating to themselves rights over foreigners, several 
governments execute them nowadays and confiscate their posses- 
sions. ; 

“His Royal Highness the King of Achem seizes all vessels 
that run aground on the reefs in his coastal waters. 

“Unsociableness toughens a man’s heart and thereby renders 
him fitter for great deeds; so it is that we see theft and murder 
erected into virtues; and only in those nations where this occurs do 
we ever see great feats and great men. 

“The murder of foreigners is held a praiseworthy action in 
Kamchatka. 

‘The blacks of Loango go farther still in their aversion to the 
hospitable virtues: they will not even suffer a stranger to be buried 
in their country. 

“The entire world, in short, furnishes us examples of national 
loathing for the virtues of hospitality; and from this overwhelming 
accumulation of evidence and from our own reflections we are 
obliged to conclude that there is probably nothing more injurious 
nor more contrary to one’s well-being and to that of others than a 
rule whose purpose is to bind the rich man to give asylum to the 
poor whereof the latter will never profit save to his ultimate and 
inevitable detriment and to the donor’s also. A man can enter a

foreign land for one of only two reasons: because of his curiosity, 
or because he is in search of dupes; in the first case, he must be 
made to pay for his entertainment; in the second, he must be 
punished.” 

“Oh, Minski!” I replied, ‘you persuade me; the maxims I 
have long embraced upon charity, upon benevolence, are too similar 
to yours upon hospitality for me not to concur in the opinions you 
have just expounded. But there is yet another thing concerning 
which I would be grateful for your advice: Augustine, whose 
attachment to me was of several years’ standing, is survived by 
aged parents, they are needy and quite unable to shift for them- 
selves; as we were starting upon our journey she mentioned them 
to me and asked me not to forget them if perchance some mishap 
were to befall her during our absence from home; do you think I 
should settle a pension upon them?.. .” 

“Certainly not,” Minski was quick to answer, “by what right 
would you presume to do any such thing? And for their part, what 
claim can the parents of your late friend make to your bounty? You 
paid that girl wages, did you not, you maintained her the whole 
while she was in your hire; what connection does that establish 
between you and her parents? You owe them absolutely nothing, 
and neither, for that matter, did she. If, as I would judge from 
your philosophy you must, you have a clear idea of the nothingness 
of the fraternal bond alleged to subsist among men; if you have 
sufficiently pondered that idea and from it drawn the obvious con- 
clusions, you cannot help but realize, first of all, that between 
Augustine and the services she rendered you there is no possible 
relation: for services, being of a temporal nature, exist only in the 
performance, and she who performed these is no longer able to 
perform at all. You are sensible of the distinction; and so must 
apree that any identification of the one with the other is founded 
upon flimsy illusion; the only real feeling that can remain to us for 
a departed servitor would be gratitude; and you know that no 
proud spirit can ever be grateful: he who refuses a service offered 
by another or who, having accepted one, considers himself in no 
wise beholden to a beriefactor who acted for none but his own 
pride’s sake; he, I say, is far more of a man than the ignominious 


Juliette & 597 


fellow who, willingly donning the shackles of indebtedness, prepares 
his benefactor the pleasure of parading his victim like a captive at 
a triumph; no, I shall say more, and though you may have heard 
it said already, it cannot be repeated too often: one ought normally 
to desire the death of the benefactor from whom one is not yet 
discharged of obligation, and I am never surprised to hear of 
accounts being settled by a murder. Oh, Juliette, how greatly do 
study and deep thought improve our understanding of the human 
heart; and how great becomes our determination to defy human 
principles once we come to know the being who devised them, for 
they are all of man’s making, and in the name of what do you call 
upon me to respect that which is no more than the handiwork of 
somebody no better than I? Yes, this subject once thoroughly 
explored and pondered, .many crimes which would look atrocious 
to simpletons and leave them aghast, appear perfectly unpretentious 
and natural to us: let word get about that Tom, in pressing need of 
money, received a hundred Jouis from Dick and then for all his 
thanks plunged a knife into Dick’s breast, and watch your vulgar 
mob go quite berserk, hear those idiots shout murder and baw! for 
justice. Aye, they shout, they bawl; and the fact remains that this 
murderer is of a finer cut and nobler soul than his adversary, since 
the one, in obliging, did nought but defer to his pride while the 
other could not -endure to see himself humbled; here we have 
ingratitude in the form of a splendid deed. Ah, frail mortals! how 
blindly you proceed with the sorting of your virtues and your vices, 
and how quickly the complexion of your scheme is reversed, black 
turned into white, daysinto night under the most superficial ex- 
amination; you cannot imagine, Juliette, the insuperable tendency I 
have always had to ingratitude, it is the virtue of my heart, and 
never has anyone attempted to oblige me but I have been revolted 
by the prospect: once upon a time someone proposed me his 
services and, repressing my fury, I said to him, ‘Have a care, my 
friend, things will go ill between us if I accept your rash offer.’ 
“This. act of charity you are meditating with regard to 
Augustine’s necessitous parents would have all the disadvantageous 
aspects presented by pity and compassion, feelings to which, as it 
appears to me, you are not much addicted. Charity makes for 


598 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


nothing but dupes, Juliette, benevolence nothing but foes; believe 
what I say, my doctrine is sound, only adhere to it and you shall 
never have cause to complain of me.” 

“Such principles su.t my character and have been responsible 
for my felicity,” said I to the giant; “virtue has always appalled 
me, never has it given rise to pleasure for me.” And to lend weight 
to these statements I related how a moment of virtuousness had 
once reduced me to rag and ruin and all but cost me my life. 

“T have no such reproach to make to myself,” Minski declared, 
“and since earliest childhood my heart has never for a single 
moment been assailed by these abject sentiments whose effects are 
so dangerous; I hate virtue as I hate-religion. I consider the one 
as deadly as the other, and I shall never be seen in their clutches. 
My only regret, as I have already confessed to you, is that I have 
too few crimes to my credit; crime is my element, it and it alone 
sustains me and inspires me, it is my sole reason for living, and 
mine would become a sorry and aimless existence if I were to cease 
committing at least one crime an hour.” 

“From what you tell me I wager you must have been the 
executioner of your family.” 

“Alas. My father escaped me, and I have not yet got over 
it. I never had a fair try at him, he died while I was still too young. 
However, all the rest perished by my hand; I have related the 
killing of my mother and sister, often I have wished they were 
alive again so that I might have the pleasure of butchering them 
anew. What’s left for me these days? I have nothing but ordinary 
victims to sacrifice, my heart grows heavy, all pleasures fade, they 
pall, the enjoyment is gone—” 

“Oh, Minski,” I cried, “to the contrary, I deem you a happy 
man; I too have tastec! those delights, although not to such an 
extent. .. . My friend, your reminiscences, your remarks stir me 
beyond words; I would ask you a favor: to let me rove through 
your castle’s hundred halls, to dally with your innumerable minions, 
open up to me this vast field of crime, let me fertilize it with 
fuck and with cadavers.’ 

“I shall, but upon one condition. I don’t propose to sodomize 
you, it would be your ruin; but I demand the total cession of that 
young man,” said Minski, and it was to Zephyr he referred. 


Juliette & 599 


My hesitation lasted an instant... . The icy point of a stiletto 
tingled upon my breast. 

“Choose,” that fierce man bade me, “between death and the 
pleasures my house can afford you.” 

Yes, despite my fondness for Zephyr, I surrendered him— 
could I do otherwise ?

W removed to another apartment. A magnificent repast of 
exotic fruits, of pastries, of milk and of warm beverages was 
presented by a swarm of half-naked boys who, as they brought 
around the plates, cut a thousand merry capers, performed a 
thousand little naughtinesses one more libertine than the other. 
My two men and I breakfasted heartily. As for Minski, he was 
served solider stuff: eight or ten virgins-blood sausages and two 
testicle pasties took the edge off his hunger, eighteen magnums of 
Greek wine accompanied those victuals into his enormous belly. 
He picked baseless quarrels with a dozen of his little pages, lashed 
six of them to ribbons, pounded the other six senseless with his 
fists. When one boy resisted him, the dastard broke both his arms 
like matchsticks, and that just as calmly as making the simplest 
gesture; he stabbed two more, and we began our tour of inspection. 

The first room we came to was large, billeted in it were ten- 
score women, aged twenty to thirty-five. Upon our entering, and 
this was the time-honored custom, two executioners laid hold of a 
victim and hanged her naked before our eyes. Minski went up 
to the dangling creature, felt her buttocks, bit them; in the mean- 
time all the other women drew smartly up in six rows. We walked 
up and down the ranks to have a nearer view of the women con- 
stituting them. These women were dressed in such a manner that 
none of their charms were concealed: a simple drape of tulle left 
their breasts and buttocks exposed, but their cunts were not visible 
at all, Minski preferring to be spared the sight of a shrine in 
which he was little given to performing his devotionals. 

Leading off this room was another, not quite so spacious and 
containing twenty-five beds; this was the infirmary for women who 
had been injured by the ogre’s intemperances or who fell ill. 

“Should the indisposition become serious,” Minski said to 
me as he opened one of the windows, “I transfer them to the 
outdoor ward.”

Fancy our surprise when, peering into the courtyard below, 
we discovered it crowded with bears, lions, leopards, and tigers. 

“Indeed,” said I, “such leeches must very shortly relieve 
anybody of what ails him.” 

“Oh yes. Down there they’re cured in the twinkling of an 
eye. It is rapid, it is tidy, it avoids contamination of the air. A sickly 
woman, one wasted by disease can be of no use to lewdness; better 
to be rid of her at once, I believe. And one saves money; for you 
will agree, Juliette, defective females are not worth what it costs to 
keep them alve.” 

In all the other seraglios it was the same hanging, the same 
inspection of the ranks. 

Minski visits a sickroom, six patients look to him a little 
worse than the rest, he snatches them bodily from their beds and 
heaves them one after the other into the menagerie where they 
are devoured ina matter of minutes. 

“That,” Minski whispers to me while we watch the terrible 
feast, “‘is one of my favorite diversions. Exciting, isn’t it ?”’ 

“Incredibly, my dea-,” I answer the giant, staring delightedly 
at the spectacle, guiding jis hand toward my cunt; “probe about in 
there and verify whether or not I share your sentiments.” 

And I discharged. Inferring that I might be pleased to witness 
the doctoring of a second batch of sufferers, Minski rounded up a 
number of girls who had nothing more wrong with them than a 
few virtually healed scratches and bruises. They trembled as they 
were led up to the window. To prolong and heighten our amuse- 
ment we had them gaze awhile at the savage beasts for which they 
were about to become fodder; Minski’s nails raked their buttocks, 
I pinched their breasts, tweaked their nipples. Then out they were 
tossed. The giant and I frigged each other during the massacre; 
the spasms which jarred me made me fairly scream my joy. 

We rambled through the other apartments where all manner 
of horrifying scenes weve enacted; Zephyr expired in the course 
of one of the most ferocious of them. 

“Well, good friend,” I commented, when I had sated my 
passions, “you can hardly deny that the conduct you permit yourself 
here, and which in my weakness I have copied, is abominably 
unjust.” 


Juliette & 605 


” that libertine invited me, ‘and listen to 


“Come sit down, 
what I have to say. 

“Before deciding, simply because of the veneer of injustice 
you see there, that the action I commit is blameworthy, we had 
better, I think, come to some sort of understanding upon what we 
mean by just and unjust. If now you meditate a little upon the 
ideas lying behind these terms, you will recognize that they are 
most profoundly relative, and profoundly lacking in anything 
intrinsically real. Similar to concepts of virtue and vice, they are 
purely local and geographical; that which is vicious in Paris turns 
up, as we know, a virtue in Peking, and it is quite the same thing 
here: that which is just in Isfahan they call unjust in Copenhagen. 
Amidst these manifold variations do we discover anything con- 
stant? Only this: each country’s peculiar legal code, each indi- 
vidual’s peculiar interests, provide the sole bases of justice. But 
these national, these regional laws depend upon the preferences 
of the government locally in power, and these interests depend 
upon the physiology of the individual who holds them; thus, self- 
interest, you see it very clearly, is the single rule for defining just 
and unjust; and thus, in the light of a certain law, it will be very 
just in a certain country to behead a man for a deed which would 
win him laurels elsewhere, quite as a certain individual interest 
will reckon just a deed which, nonetheless, the person whom it 
harms will esteem very iniquitous. Some examples may be cited. 

‘In Paris the law punishes thieves; it rewards them in Sparta: 
robbery is legitimate in Greece and highly illegal in France, and 
justice consequently as illusory as virtue. A man breaks his enemy’s 
back; he will tell you he has done the right and just thing, now 
ask his victim for his view of the matter. Themis is therefore an 
altogether make-believe goddess, whose scales ever show in favor 
of him who tips them harder, arid over whose sightless eyes they 
need hardly have bothered to place a blindfold.” 

‘“‘Minski,” I remarked, “I have often heard it said, however, 
that there is a kind of natural justice man has always and every- 
where adhered to, or which he has never violated without ruing 
it afterward.” 

“Sheer nonsense,” said the Muscovite, ‘‘that fabled natural 
justice is simply the fruit of man’s weakness, his ignorance, or his 


606 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


folly whenever it is not to his advantage to propagate the lie. 
If he is of little strength he will always, automatically, belong to 
the natural-justice camp, and will always discover injustice in the 
hurt inflicted by the mighty upon members of his class; let him 
acquire some power himself, then his opinion and his ideas touching 
justice change instantaneously : henceforth nothing but what flatters 
him will be just, nothin equitable but what serves his passions; 
analyze it carefully, this famous natural justice always reveals 
itself based upon his interests; take Nature for your guide when 
you shape your laws, on-y in this way will you avoid error. Well, 
is there any limit to the injustices we see her commit all the time? 
Is there anything so unjust as the hailstorm that capricious power 
flings to ruin the poor peasant, although—explain it as you will— 
not a grape in his rich neighbor’s vineyards is spoiled? and the 
wars .of her fomentiag in whose course the whole of a land is laid 
waste for the sole benefit of some tyrant, and the fortunes she 
permits the villain to amass while the honest man founders all 
his life in hardship and privation? Say, those diseases wherewith 
she slaughters the populations of entire provinces, those repeated, 
innumerable triumphs she accords brazen vice while not a day 
passes but she grinds deserving virtue beneath her heel; this pro- 
tection she forever grants to the powerful man, seconding him 
to the detriment of the helpless—I ask you, is all that just? and 
may we suppose we are uilty when we imitate her? 

‘“HYence—no other conclusion is warranted—there is not the 
slightest wrong of any scrt in violating all the imaginary principles 
of human justice as we zo about composing our own, tailored to 
fit our personal needs, and which will always be the best of all 
justices because expressly constructed for the service of our 
passions and our interests: in thts world only they are sacred; and 
if true wrong there be, it is whenever we award a preference to 
hallucinations, neglecting sentiments given us by Nature, who is 
truly outraged by any sacrifice we are weak enough to make of 
them. Despite the allegations of your demi-philosopher Montes- 
quieu, justice is not eternal, it is not immutable, it is not in all 
lands and in all ages the same; those are falsehoods, and the truth 
is the reverse: justice depends purely upon the human conventions, 


Juliette & 607° 


the character, the temperament, the national moral codes of a 
country. ‘If that were so,’ the same author continues,) if justice 
were but the consequence of human conventions, ‘of characters, 
temperaments, etc., it would be a dreadful truth such as one would | 
have to dissimulate from oneself. . . .. And why hide such essential. 
truths from oneself? Is there a single one man should flee from? 
‘It would be dangerous,’ the same Montesquieu continues, ‘because 
it would put man ever in fear of man and bring to an end all our 
security of property, of honor, and of life itself.’ But where is the 
necessity to adopt this mean little prejudice, to shut one’s eyes 
to truths so general, so vital? Is he of any help to us, who seeing 
us enter a forest where he has himself been attacked by bandits, 
does not alert us of the perils that perhaps lurk there? Yes, yes, 
let us have the courage to tell men that justice is a myth, and that 
each individual never actually heeds any but his own; let us say 
so fearlessly. Declaring it to them, and giving them thus to 
appreciate all the dangers of human existence, our warning enables 
them to ready a defense and in their turn to forge themselves the 
weapon of injustice, since only by becoming as unjust, as vicious 
as everybody else can they hope to elude the traps set by others. 
‘Justice,” Montesquieu rattles on, is a seeming and right relation- 
ship existing really between two things, independently of the view 
any person may take of them.’ 

‘Where have you encountered a greater piece of sophistry? 
Never has justice been a seeming and right relationship really 
existing between two things. Justice has no real existence, it is 
the deity of every passion: this passion finds justice in this act, 
that passion finds justice in that act, and although those acts may 
be contradictory and usually are, those passions find them just 
nonetheless. So let us abandon our belief in this fiction, it no more 
exists than does the God of whom fools believe it the image: there 
is no God in this world, neither is there virtue, neither is there 
justice ; there is nothing good, useful, or necessary but our passions, 
nothing merits to be respected but their effects. 

“Nor is that all; I go farther, and regard unjust acts as

indispensable to the maintenance of universal harmony, necessarily 
disturbed by an equitable order in things. This fact once realized, 
for what reason would ] abstain from all the iniquities my brain 
conceives since it is proven that they are useful to the general plan? 
Is it my fault if it be my capacities Nature is pleased to enlist for 
preserving her law and order in this world? Of course not, and if 
only through atrocities, execrations, and horrors this end may be 
attained, why, let’s perpetrate them cheerfully and serenely, in the 
knowledge that our delights answer Nature’s aims.” 

We continued our tour of the apartments and put into practice 
the theories which the giant had just developed for me. Our un- 
speakable doings finally reduced me to such a point of exhaustion 
that I was obliged to beg quarter, and announced that the one 
desire I had left was to repose myself for the rest of the day. 

“Just as you like,” said he, “I can perfectly well postpone until 
tomorrow showing you the two rooms you have yet to see, and 
which contain features and equipment that will probably astonish 
you.” 

Sbrigani and I retired to our bedchamber; when alone with 
my one remaining traveling companion, “Good friend,” said I, 
“we found entry into the palace of vice and horror, if this piece 
of excellent fortune is not to be spoiled we must now find a way 
out of it. My confidence in the ogre is not so entire as to recommend 
our remaining any longer under his roof. With me I have reliable 
means for being rid of tais personage, after whose death we could 
very easily seize his treasure and be off. However, our host is too 
great a menace to humanity, my principles approve too warmly of 
such a character and of such depravations for me to wrest him 
away from the world. I’: would be to borrow the role of the law, 
it would be to serve society, to banish this scoundrel out of it, and 
I am not so fond of virtue as to render it such an enormous service. 
So I propose to let this man live rather than throw crime into 
mourning: eh, a Friend of Crime deprive Crime of a sectator? 
Perish the thought! We must rob him, that is all; but it is impor- 
tant, he is richer than we and equality has always been the corner- 
stone of my doctrine. Rob him, then fly; else he will not fail to 
kill us, for pleasure’s sake or perhaps to rob us himself. With some

stramonium we shall drug him, while he sleeps steal his money, 
pick the two prettiest wenches out of his harems, and escape.” 

Sbrigani was not immediately won over to my scheme: stra- 
monium, he pointed out, might not have effect upon a body of 
such prodigious size, a concentrated dose of strong poison looked 
by far the more advisable thing to him; specious as my consider- 
ations were, they must cede before those of our safety and, accord- 
ing to my husband, that would be uncertain so long as the ogre 
remained alive. But unshakable in my resolve to take all possible 
care never to be the undoing of anyone as wicked as I, I held firm. 
At last we decided that after administering the soporific to the 
ogre while breakfasting with him, we would proclaim to his 
hirelings the success of a plot against his life, thus forestalling any 
objections they might raise to our appropriation of his wealth, and 
that once we had emptied his coffers we would quit the place forth- 
with. 

It all came out remarkably well. Swallowing the chocolate into 
which we had slipped the stramonium, Minski sank a few minutes 
later into a torpor so deep that we had no trouble persuading the 
household that its overlord was dead. His steward was the first to 
seek to induce us to reign in his stead; we feigned consent, and 
having had the treasure chests opened, we loaded the most valuable 
of their contents upon ten men. Proceeding next to the harem of 
women, we chose two French girls, Elise and Raimonde, re- 
spectively seventeen years of age and eighteen, and then set forth 
after assuring the major-domo that we would shortly return to 
lead him and the others away; that we were indeed prepared to 
succeed to the place left vacant by his deceased master, but felt 
that such splendid possessions would be put to better showing in 
some one of the cities of the plain, where we ought all to remove 
rather than continue to dwell like bears in this dreadful den. En- 
chanted, the major-domo facilitated everything, concurred in every- 
thing, and for his cooperation was doubtless richly rewarded by 
the giant when upon awakening he learned of his losses and of our 
flight. 

Our loot loaded into our carriages, our women and ourselves 
installed inside, we dismissed the ten porters, after paying them 
for their trouble and advising them to head in any direction except 


610 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


back to the inferno where only calamity would be awaiting them. 
They did not dispute the wisdom of our counsel, we bade them 
farewell and departed. That same evening we reached the outskirts 
of Florence. When we procured lodgings we turned to taking stock 
of our treasures and to appraising our two women: they were 
lovely creatures. 

Seventeen-year-old Elise combined all Venus’ graces with. the 
seductive charms of the goddess of flowers. Raimonde, a year older, 
had one of those inspiring faces you cannot look upon without 
emotion; both of them recently acquired by Minski, neither had 
yet been touched, and it need hardly be stressed that this circum- 
stance was among the principal ones which had led me to select 
them. They helped us tally our booty, it included six million in 
gold and silver coin, another four in gems, plate, ingots and 
Italian banknotes. Ah, how my eyes feasted upon this hoard, and 
how sweet it is to count riches when we owe it to a crime! These 
tasks dispatched, we retired, and in the arms of my two new con- 
quests I spent the most delicious night I had enjoyed in a long time. 


Allow me now to speak for a moment, my friends, of the 
superb city we came to the following morning. Listening to these 
details will have a refreshing influence upon your imaginations, 
berayed as they are by this lengthy series of obscene anecdotes: 
such a digression, I should think, can only render more piquant 
that which the truth you have demanded of me shall perhaps 
shortly oblige me to relate. 

Constructed by Sulla’s troops, embellished by the triumvirs, 
destroyed by Attila, ther rebuilt by Charlemagne; enlarged at the 
expense of the ancient city of Fiesole, its neighbor, of which today 
only ruins are left; for many decades torn by internecine strife; 
subjugated by the Medizis who having ruled it for two hundred 
years finally let it pass to the House of Lorraine, Florence is now 
governed as is the whole of Tuscany whereof it is the chief town, 
by Leopold, Archduke and brother of the Queen of France,’ a

Madame de Lorsange was touring in Italy. Everybody knows the changes that have 
transpired since, both in Florence and in other parts of this fine country. (Note added.) 


Juliette & 611 


despotic, haughty, and ungracious prince, like the rest of his 
family very crapulous and libertine, as my subsequent narrations 
shall soon convince you. 

Soon after arriving in this city I was able to conclude that the 
Florentines still think back nostalgically upon their native-born 
princes and resent being under the control of foreigners. Nobody 
is taken in by Leopold’s seeming simplicity; the popular costume 
he affects does not conceal his Germanic arrogance, and those who 
know anything of the spirit and temper of the Austrian dynasty 
understand why its members have far less difficulty pretending to 
virtues than acquiring them. 

Florence, lying at the foot of the Apennine range, is split 
by the River Arno; this central part of Tuscany’s capital is some- 
what similar to the heart of Paris, traversed by the Seine; but 
there the comparison between the two cities must end, for Florence 
has many fewer inhabitants and in extent is a great deal smaller 
than the other. The reddish-brown stone of which its larger build- 
ings are constructed gives it a disagreeable, forlorn air. Had I a 
liking for churches I would probably have some glowing descrip- 
tions to offer you, but my aversion for everything associated with 
religion is so compelling that I could not take it upon myself to 
enter a single one of those temples. It was otherwise with the 
superb ducal palace gallery, I went to visit it the day after we 
arrived. Impossible to render for you my enthusiasm at being 
amidst all those masterpieces. I adore the arts, they excite me; 
everything that imitates glorious Nature must be cherished too... . 
No encouragement is too great for those who love and copy her. 
There is but one way to make her bare her secrets, through inces- 
sant, unwearying study of her; only by probing into her furthermost 
recesses may one finally destroy the last of one’s misconceptions. 
I adore a talented woman; a pretty face will seduce me, but the 
spell talents weave captivates more durably; and I think that the 
one is more flattering than the other to amour-propre. 

My guide, as you may readily suppose, did not fail to show 
me the room in that celebrated museum where Cosimo Medici was 
surprised at one of his little infamies. The famous Vasari was busy 
painting the ceiling of the apartment when Cosimo appeared there 
with his daughter, of whom he was inordinately fond: never pausing 


612 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to think that the painter might be at work on the scaffolding over- 
head, that incestuous prince proceeded to caress the object of his 
ardors. Cosimo espies the couch nearby, the couple repair to it, the 
act is consummated within the view of the artist who, just as soon 
as he could, hurried from Florence, believing that violence would 
surely be used to prevent intelligence of such a liaison from getting 
abroad, and that witnessing what he had could well mean an early 
doom. Vasari’s were not idle fears at a period and in a town where 
the teachings of Machiavelli found no end of disciples: it was wise 
of him not to expose himself to the cruel effects of those doctrines. 

A little farther on ray attention was drawn to an altar of solid 
gold and studded with precious stones—one of those objects I 
invariably covet at first sight. This immensely rich and wondrously 
wrought bit of furniture, it was explained to me, was an ex-voto 
which Grand Duke Ferdinand II, who died in 1630, offered to 
St. Charles Borromeo for the recovery of his health. The gift had 
been packed off and was on the road when Ferdinand died; the 
heirs, reasonable people, decided that since the saint had not 
answered the prayer, they were exempted from the payment and 
recalled the treasure. For how many extravagances is not super- 
stition accountable, and with what confidence we can afhirm that 
of all the multitude of human follies this one doubtless has the 
most degrading effects upon the spirit and the mind. 

From there we went to look at Titian’s renowned ‘‘Venus,”’ 
and I confess that before this sublime work my emotions were 
stirred as they had not been by Ferdinand’s ex-voto: the beauties 
of Nature are uplifting to the soul, religious absurdities make it 
recoil in disgust. 

The “Venus” is z delicious blonde, with lovely eyes, but 
features a shade too sharply drawn for a blonde whose charms, 
as composed by Nature, are usually, like her character, of a dreamy 
softness. The subject appears upon a white couch, one of her hands 
toys with flowers, the other has strayed coyly to cover her pretty 
little bush; voluptuous is her attitude, and unwearyingly one pores 
over the beauties of this sublime picture’s details. Sbrigani re- 
marked that this Venus seemed to him to bear a striking resem- 
blance to our Raimonde; I agreed. The pretty creature blushed 
innocently when we reported our findings to her; from the fiery kiss 


Juliette & 613 


I laid upon her lips she could measure my approval of my husband's 
comparison. 

In the next room, known as the Chamber of the Idols, we 
found a great store of works by Titian, Paolo Veronese, and Guido. 
And in that room we saw something very curious indeed: a 
sepulcher overflowing with cadavers severally exhibiting all the 
various stages of decay, from the moment of death’s advent to the 
total material decomposition of the individual. This somber work 
is executed in wax colored so subtly and modeled so cunningly 
that the thing itself could be neither more expressive of Nature 
nor more authentic. So powerful is the impression produced by 
this masterpiece that as you gaze at it your other senses are played 
upon, moans seem audible, you wrinkle your nose quite as if you 
could detect the evil odors of mortality. . . . These scenes of the 
plague appealed to my cruel imagination; and, I mused, how many 
persons had undergone these awful metamorphoses thanks to my 
wickedness? But I rove. Let me say only that Nature probably 
impelled me to those crimes since even the mere recollection of 
them still thrills me to the core. 

Nearby it is another miniature representing, in the same style, 
another common grave teeming with plague victims, and here the 
most interesting figure is a naked man who, as he drops the corpse 
he is carrying in among the rest, is himself overcome by the stench 
or overwhelmed by the sight, reels back, and dies: the treatment of 
this group is terrifyingly realistic. 

We now came to gayer objects. The Tribunal Chamber, as it 
is called, contained the celebrated ‘Medici Venus”: and upon 
beholding that stunning piece a rush of emotion assailed me as 
surely must happen to any sensitive spectator. A Greek, they say, 
was smitten by passion for a statue. . . . It is understandable ; I could 
well have duplicated his distracted behavior, I trow: a survey of 
this work’s wondrous features leads one to believe tradition says 
true in reporting that the sculptor resorted to no fewer than five 
hundred models before completing it; the proportions of this sub- 
lime effigy, the beauty of the face, the heavenly contours of each 
limb, the graceful curves of the breasts, of the buttocks, are touches 
attesting a human genius rivaling Nature’s own, and I doubt 
whether three times as many models chosen from all the world 


614 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


boasts of the most beautiful could today furnish a creature that 
would benefit from comparison with this one. It is generally agreed 
that this statue shows us the Venus of Greek seafarers; I need not 
describe it at greater length, it has been copied often enough; but 
though a reproduction of it is within anyone’s means to buy, 
nobody will ever appreciate it quite as I did... . This marvelous 
piece was once broken by some vandals, led by their execrable 
piety to this act of madness. The boors, fools! they worshiped 
the author of Nature and thought to please her by shattering her 
noblest work. Touching the sculptor’s identity there is disagree- 
ment; common opinion ascribes the work to Praxiteles, others say 
Cleomenes made it: whoever the artist may have been, his creation 
is magnificent, it is admired, it inspires the imagination, contem- 
plating it is one of the sweetest pleasures that can be derived from 
the sight of man-made th ngs. 

My eyes fell next upon ‘“The Hermaphrodite.” As you know, 
the Romans, who all had a special fondness for these monsters, 
welcomed them into their saturnalian assemblies; the one repre- 
sented here was probablv among those whose lubricious reputation 
was outstandingly notor ous and hence deserved commemoration; 
but its legs are crossed, which is a pity, for the sculptor should 
have displayed what characterized its double sex and singular 
amenities; it is shown -eclining upon a bed, exposing the most 
tempting ass in all the world . . . a voluptuous ass which Sbrigani 
coveted, telling me he had once bum-fucked a similar creature and 
had never been able to forget the delight it had given him. 

Close by is the group, Caligula and his sister; ah, those proud 
masters of the world, far from concealing their vices, hired artists 
to immortalize them. In she same room you will also find the famous 
Priapus upon which young girls were obliged, as one of the re- 
quirements of their faith, to rub the lips of their vaginas. This 
deity’s member is reproduced with such stout proportions that 
introduction must surely have been impossible, or exceedingly 
difficult, if that too was. perchance enjoined by the rites. 

We were shown chastity belts. “Examine those devices well,” 
I recommended to my two sweethearts, “you shall be strapped into 
the like the day I have any doubts of your fidelity.” To which the 
mild-tempered Elise delicately replied that her devotion to me 


Juliette & 615 


would always suffice to restrain her within the bounds of the 
strictest temperance. 

Next we saw a splendid collection of daggers, some of them 
were poisoned; nowhere has murder been refined as amongst the 
Italians, it is therefore quite the ordinary thing to find in their 
homes all sorts of instruments for murdering, in the cruelest and 
most traitorous manner. 

The air at Florence is very unwholesome, autumn may be 
positively fatal there: during that season, leave a bit of bread 
steep in the Apennine miasmas, it will molder invisibly and sicken 
anybody who tastes it; sudden deaths, apoplexies become very 
frequent at that time of year. But as we were then in early spring 
I considered we could remain through the summer without risk. 
We bedded only two nights at our inn; the third day I rented a 
fine house overlooking the Arno: I took it in Sbrigani’s name, for 
I was still masquerading as his wife and my two followers were 
become his sisters. Established there upon the same footing as at 
Turin and in the other Italian cities where I had made residence, 
no sooner had intelligence of us got abroad than the propositions 
began to arrive. But upon the advice of a friend of Sbrigani, who 
esteemed that moderation and no improper eagerness to leap at 
offers would perhaps win us admission to the Grand Duke’s secret 
revels, we refused all bids for a fortnight. 

The prince’s emissaries appeared in due course. Leopold 
wished to have the services of the three of us at a forgathering 
which would also include the everyday objects of his private de- 
bauches, and our unreserved cooperation would be worth a thousand 
sequins to each of us. 

‘“Leopold’s tastes are despotic and cruel, like those of all 
sovereigns,” his representative explained to us, “however, you 
have nothing to fear, you shall be merely to serve his lusts, others 
will be his prey.” 

“We shall be at the Grand Duke’s orders,” I answered, ‘‘put, 
my good sir, for a thousand sequins . . . hardly. No, my sisters- 
in-law and { are only to be had for thrice that sum; come back if 
those terms are acceptable.” 

Libertine Leopold, who had already cast eyes upon us, was 
not the man to forego such delights because of a trifling two 


616 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thousand sequins more. Miserly toward his wife, toward the poor, 
toward his subjects, Austria’s fairest son spent generously upon 
his pleasures. And so we were called for the following morning 
and conducted to Pratolino, in the Apennines and on the road by 
which we had gained Florence. 

That villa, shaded, solitary, and voluptuous, lacked none of 
the features characteristic of a retreat for debauchery. The Grand 
Duke was finishing dinner when we arrived; with him he had only 
his chaplain, the agent and confidant of his lubricities. 

“Dear friends,” the lord of Tuscany declared, “step this way 
if you please, we are awzited by those young persons my lust is to 
feed upon today.” 

“One moment, Leopold,” said I, that elevated tone of self- 
respect in my voice for which I have always been noted, “my sisters 
and I shall submit ourselves to your caprices, we shall satisfy your 
desires; but if, as people of your sort so frequently are, you too 
are given to dangerous fantasies, then say so now, for we do not 
intend to enter the arena unless we are sure we shall emerge from 
it safe and sound.” 

‘The victims have already been appointed, they are there,” 
the Grand Duke replied to me, “you are to be the priestesses in 
this affair, nothing more; and we, the Abbot and I, the sacrificers.” 

“You heard the gentleman,” I said to my companions, “in 
we go. Faithless knaves though they are, sovereigns may some- 
times be trusted, above all when you have reliable means for 
vengeance about you,” and casting back my sleeve I afforded 
Leopold a glimpse of the haft of the poniard I had been carrying 
ever since the day I entered Italy. 

“What,” cried he, laying a hand upon my shoulder, “you 
would attempt the life of a sovereign?” 

“If provoked, of course,” I rejoined. “I'll start no trouble, 
but if you were to forget whom you were dealing with, this knife” — 
and I now drew it all the way into view—‘‘will make you remem- 
ber that your mistake was to behave inconsiderately toward a 
Frenchwoman. 

“As regards your royal sacrosanctity, in my country we sneer 
at such rubbish. You don’t suppose, do you, that the heaven that 
made you made your existence one whit more inviolable than that 


Juliette & 617 


of the meanest individual in your realm? My respect for you is no 
greater than for him; a zealous egalitarian, I have never considered 
one living creature any better than any other, and as I have no 
belief in moral virtues, neither do I consider that they are differ- 
entiated by any moral worth.” 

“But I ama king.” 

“Poor fellow! As if I were to be impressed by that title! 
Why, Leopold, you cannot guess how little it means to me. How 
did you get to where you are? By luck. What did you to do to 
merit your rank? That first of kings who earned it through his 
courage or his cunning, he could perhaps claim to some esteem; 
but he who has it through mere inheritance, may he hope for more 
than compassion ?”” 

“Regicide is a crime—” 

“Disabuse yourself, my friend: it is no worse than killing a 
cobbler, and you do as much evil, or as little, when you squash a 
beetle or murder a butterfly, Nature having fashioned those 
insects also. You may believe it, Leopold, the manufacture of your 
person cost our common mother no more effort than creating a 
monkey, and yours would be a serious error if you let yourself 
imagine that she cares for this one of her children any more than 
for that.” 

“I find this woman’s outspokenness quite engaging,” Leopold 
said to his chaplain. 

“And so do I, Sire,” declared the man of God; “but I fear 
that such pride will prevent her from showing your Worship’s 
pleasures all the subordination they require.” 

“Fear nothing of the sort, my good Abbot,” said I; “proud 
and frank in social conversations, meek and mild in intimate ones: 
such is the part of a pretty French courtesan, ’twill be mine. But 
if in the boudoir I look a slave, remind yourself that it is only 
before your passions I bend a knee, not before your kingliness. 
I respect passions, Leopold, I have them as well as you, but I 
stubbornly refuse to bow before rank: be a man, you'll obtain 
everything from me; nothing, I warn you, as a prince; let us 
begin.” 

It was a voluptuous salon Leopold bade us enter, and there 
awaiting us were the creatures he had alluded to and with whom 


618 e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


we were about to disport; who ever would have believed it? they 
were a quartet of girls aged fifteen or sixteen, and all four pregnant 
to the bursting point. 

‘“What the devil do you plan to do with these articles?” I 
inquired of the Grand Duke. 

‘You shall see before very long,” he replied. “I am the father 
of the infants they are ready to whelp, and I sired them solely for 
the sake of the delicious pleasure I shall have in destroying them. 
I know of no greater satisfaction than causing a woman I have 
ingravidated to miscarry, and as my seminal product is uncom- 
monly abundant, I impregnate at least one a day to insure the 
wherewithal for my daily destructions.” 

‘Ah ha,” said I to the Austrian, “your passion is odd, it 
intrigues me, I shall take a willing hand in this operation; and 
how-do you procced with it ?” 

‘Have a little patience, young lady, you shall be witness to 
every detail,” said Leopold who until now had communicated with 
me in a whisper. ‘“‘We begin by announcing the fate in store for 
them.” 

Whereupon he approached the four girls and notified them 
of his intentions. I need hardly tell you, my friends, that upon 
hearing this perfidious declaration they were all without exception 
plunged into the depths of distress; two fainted, the other two set 
to squealing like pigs being led to slaughter. But unfeeling Leopold 
only commanded his agent to strip off their clothes. 

“Fair ladies,” the Grand Duke then said to us, “will you 
kindly imitate these demoiselles, and undress yourselves too? I 
never enjoy a woman except when she is naked; and, indeed, I 
suspect your bodies are pretty enough to merit being observed 
unveiled.” 

A moment later Leopold was surrounded by seven naked 
women. 

We were favored by that libertine’s preliminary homage. He 
scrutinizes us separately, he compares us, has us stand apart, 
brings us close together, and terminates this prelude by cunt-suck- 
ing the three of us while having the pregnant girls frig him one 
after the other. Leopold liked fuck, and busied himself upon us 
until we had loosed three of four discharges apiece into his mouth. 


Juliette & 619 


While he frigged us, the Abbot socratized us, so that, excited be- 
fore and behind, we bore the prince unstinting libations. An hour of 
this and then the inconstant lecher repaired to another shrine and 
had his holy cohort tongue us successively, while he himself licked 
our assholes. And the pregnant girls frigged him still. 

“I am growing very hot,” he told us, “‘it is time we turn to 
more serious matters. You see there, in that brazier, four branding 
irons,” he continued, “they are hot too; upon each is inscribed 
the sentence of one of our laden women. I shall blindfold them, 
each shall choose her own iron.” 

The game commences; as soon as the victim selects her iron 
Leopold plucks it from the live coals and claps the fiery red tip to 
her belly. These were the legends left imprinted in the girls’ flesh: 
to the youngest, who seemed scarcely over fourteen, the hand of 
fate awarded the brand worded thus: She will miscarry under the 
lash. The next, perhaps a few months older, received the label: 4 
beverage shall be the cause of her miscarriage. The third was 
fifteen, this was her sentence: Her fruit shall be trampled from her 
belly. Upon the last, who was sixteen, was seared this dread de- 
cree: Her child will be torn from her womb. 

The ceremony over, the blindfolds were removed and the four 
wretches, looking around one at the other, were able to read their 
various condemnations aloud. Leopold then had them all stand 
in a row at the end of a couch and close to it; he laid me upon that 
couch and encunted me energetically, while doing so peering fixedly 
at those four bloated bellies, each bearing the formula whereby 
it was to be deflated. Elise flogged his Worship in the meantime and 
the Abbot, his member grooved between Raimonde’s breasts, 
frigged himself full height. 

“Leopold,” said I as we fueked, “I beseech you, keep a care- 
ful grip on yourself, for if I were to have the misfortune of becom- 
ing pregnant by you it is possible that I too would give birth pre- 
maturely.” 

“If your case were submitted to my arbitration, you most 
certainly would,” said the Grand Duke, from whose eyes I received 
glances, and from whose loins blows, that were motivated by noth- 
ing resembling gallantry, “but take some comfort from the fact I 


discharge with difficulty.” 


620 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And thereupon he left me to depucelate Elise, who had been a 
quarter of an hour thrashing him, and who was soon deserted in 
favor of Raimonde; she had been ministering to the Abbot, I re- 
placed her and after he was done with me he turned to Elise. 
Wondrous stiff and angry were the members of those two libertines. 

‘‘Aren’t we to have some buggery?” the Abbot wished to 
know, who for some time now had been caressing and fondling my 
behind in the way of a man who was eager to fuck it. 

‘Not yet,” Leopold answered, ‘“‘we must first dispatch a 
victim.” 

The little girl doomed to have the fruit lashed loose from her 
womb was seized by the sovereign who, plying first an ordinary 
bundle of withes, then « martinet whereunto steel tips lent added 
bite, toiled thirty minutes over her behind, belaboring her so 
violently that the flesh came away like chips flying before a woods- 
man’s axe. The victim was then stood up, her feet fastened to the 
floor and her upraised arms secured to cords overhead, and the 
Duke, manipulating a bull’s pizzle now, delivered such prodigiously 
powerful thwacks to her belly that the embryo was soon dislodged. 
The girl shrieks; the head of the baby emerges, and Leopold, grip- 
ping it fast, wrenches it the rest of the way forth, tosses it uncere- 
moniously into the brazi2r, and dismisses the mother. 

‘Pray ass-fuck, my Lord,” said the respectful chaplain; “your 
prick’s purpling veins, the foam wherewith your royal lips are 
besmeared, the fire darting from your eyes, everything indicates the 
imperious need you have of an ass. Fear not to spill your fuck, Sire, 
we are here to raise your fallen prick again, and we shall dispatch 
the others.” 

“No,” insisted the Grand Duke, who when not absorbed in 
other business had been kissing and mauling me throughout these 
lubricities, ‘‘no, I discharged overmuch yesterday and cannot vouch 
for better than a single spasm today; before spending my strength 
I must attend to all the riidwifery.” 

And he laid hands on the second girl. 4 beverage shall be the 
cause of her miscarriage—the fatal goblet is produced, the little 
girl condemned to quaff its contents screws up her face, twists her 
head away; but the ferocious ecclesiastic is there, with one hand 


Juliette & 621 


he holds her fast by the hair, with the other he pries her mouth 
open with a rasp; mine is the task of decanting the potion into her 
gullet, and the Duke, frigged by Elise, meanwhile handles my 
buttocks and the victim’s as well. . .. What potent elixir was this! 
Great gods, I had never seen the like of the results it obtained. 
The stuff was no sooner down the child’s throat than-she pro- 
nounces the most blood-curdling screams, flails her arms, writhes 
on the floor, and the next moment, there’s her babe. This time 
it is the Abbot who performs the delivery. Leopold, frolicking so 
lewdly with Elise and me while Raimonde pumped him, was in no 
state to accomplish the delicate operation: I thought he was ready- 
ing an ejaculation, but he avoided it, withdrawing in time. 

The third girl is stretched out flat on her back and secured 
to the floor: her fruit was to perish from being trod upon. Braced 
by Elise and me while Raimonde, on her knees and astride the 
victim, frigs his device between her compressed breasts, the liber- 
tine dances a jig upon the wretch’s belly, and out pops her infant. 
It too is tossed into the brazier, the father not even taking the 
trouble to ascertain his scion’s sex; and more dead than alive, the 
mother is ejected from the room. If the last of the four was the 
loveliest she was also the most unlucky. Her child was to be torn 
from her womb; imagine what her sufferings were to be! 

“This one won’t survive the experience,” Leopold informed 
us, ‘‘my discharge shall be owing to her unspeakable agony. It 
could not be otherwise, since of the four she, when I fucked her, 
gave me the most pleasure: the little whore conceived the same 
day I blasted her maidenhead.” 

She is afhixed to a diagonal cross of heavy timbers, at their 
intersection is a block of wood upon which her buttocks rest; her 
arms and legs are tied down and then covered over, so that noth- 
ing is to be seen of her except the rotund, swollen mass caching 
the infant. The Abbot falls to work. . . . Leopold, his eyes riveted 
upon the operation, embuggers me; both his hands are busy frig- 
ging, to the right Elise’s ass, Raimonde’s cunt to the left; and while 
the perfidious chaplain cleaves open the victim’s belly and rips

brated brother of France’s most illustrious whore, looses a torrent 
of fuck into my fundament, with another stream of foul vitupera- 
tion, curses, and black blasphemies. 

“Ladies,” said Duke Leopold as he wiped his prick, “the price 
of three thousand sequins you demanded and which I agreed to 
pay includes the cost of your silence concerning our joint doings.” 

“They shall be kept secret,” I replied, ‘‘but I pose one con- 
dition.” 

“Condition ? Condi:zion? Thunder and Godsfuck, does it be- 
seem you to speak thus?” 

“Certainly .. . and insofar as I can bring about your downfall 
by divulging them, your crimes give me rights.” 

“Behold!” stormed the Abbot, ‘‘see what happens when you 
behave liberally toward these jades: one should either never let 
them see a thing, or cut their throats once they’ve seen it. Your com- 
miseration, good my Lord, is bound to be your ruin or your purse’s, 
I have told you so over and over again; and I ask you, Sire, can 
you deign bargain with such ordures ?” 

“Softly, Abbot,” szid I, ‘‘save that kind of language for the 
penny-a-fuck mechanics you and your patron are doubtless accus- 
tomed to dealing with ordinarily; it is not appropriate when ad- 
dressing women of our rank who, perhaps as wealthy as you,” I 
pursued, turning to the Duke, ‘‘prostitute themselves less through 
greed or necessity than from taste. Let us close this discussion; 
his Worship needs our good will, we need his: some mutual services 
may redress the balance. Leopold, we will swear you the completest 
secrecy provided you for your part ensure us the completest im- 
punity so long as we remain m Florence. Swear to us that no matter 
what we do in your duchy, we shall be made to answer for nothing.” 

“I could avoid this extortion,” said Leopold, ‘“‘and, without 
staining my hands with the blood of these creatures, convince them 
that here, as in Paris, there are fortresses behind whose walls the 
garrulous learn how to hold their tongues; but I dislike using such 
methods with women who appear to me quite as libertine as I: 
I grant you the dispensation you solicit—I extend it to you, 
Madame, to your sisters-in-law, and to your husband as well, but 
for the space of six months only: that period ended, begone from 
my lands, I command it.” 


Juliette & 623 


Having obtained all I was after, I saw no reason to reply, 
and after thanking Leopold and receiving our fees we bade him 
adieu and retired. 

‘“‘We must turn this jubilee to account,” said Sbrigani once he 
had heard of our arrangement with the Grand Duke, “and before 
our time is up endeavor to add at least three millions to what we 
have already. It is truly a pity our carte blanche has been delivered 
for use in such a bedraggled, poverty-ridden part of the country; 
but never mind, we'll accept whatever is offered and snatch any- 
thing that is not, and half a year should suffice to accumulate a tidy 
little fortune.” 

Morals are very free, conduct very loose in Florence. The 
women go about costumed as men, men as girls. In few Italian 
cities does one detect so decided a penchant for betraying one’s 
own sex, and this mania the Florentines have no doubt derives 
from their pressing urge, indeed, from their need, to dishonor 
both. Sodomy with them is a craze, and at one point in the past 
the city fathers successfully negotiated with the Vatican for a 
plenary indulgence covering every form of this vice from every 
possible angle. Incest and adultery are rampant there too, no effort 
is made to conceal them: husbands cede their wives, brothers lie 
with their sisters, fathers with their daughters. 

“It’s the climate,” say these good people, “the climate is to 
blame for our depravity, and the God who placed us in these sur- 
roundings cannot be surprised at the excesses for which He is Him- 
self responsible.” 

In this connection there used to be a most unusual law in 
Florence. On Shrove Tuesday no woman had the right to refuse 
her husband’s sodomistic advances; if nevertheless she took it into 
her head to deny him, and if he interpreted her refusal as a slight 
and grounds for complaint, ’twas very likely she would be a laugh- 
ingstock all over the town. Oh, happy, happy nation this, that was 
wise enough to consecrate its passions in laws; there is proof of 
common sense, all the extravagance belongs to those benighted 
societies which out of principles equally stupid and barbarous, in- 
stead of prudently wedding one to the other, through absurd 
legislation seek to thwart all a human being’s natural propensities. 

However irregular though Florentine manners may be, 


624 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


streetwalkers are not permitted to drift loose through that city. 
The whores are restricted to a separate quarter of their own 
whence they may not venture commercially forth and where reign 
the most perfect order and calm. But these girls, seldom pretty, are 
for the most part ill-lodged; and the philosophical observer who 
visits the bawdyhouses will discover nothing of any particular in- 
terest unless it be the remarkable docility of these public play- 
things who, only too happy to attract you by means of their resigna- 
tion, present no matter what part of the body upon simple demand 
and with unwearying patience even suffer each of them to be used 
in any manner libertine cruelty deems suitable. Sbrigani and I in- 
dulged in no end of beating, whipping, slapping, burning, mutilat- 
ing, and maiming without ever hearing so much as a murmur of pro- 
test, and it is never thus. in France. But if whoring does not much 
flourish in Florence, the libertinage there is excessive nonetheless, 
and the thick-walled, secluded dwellings of the rich harbor many 
an infamy: vast are the numbers of girls who are lured or furtively 
conveyed inside those strongholds of odious proceedings, there to 
lose their honor and not infrequently their lives. 

Shortly before our arrival a wealthy notable of the town, hav- 
ing made off with a pair of little girls aged seven and eight, was 
accused by the children’s parents of raping and then murdering 
them: the evidence against the gentleman was plentiful and damn- 
ing: a few sequins to the plaintiffs and of the case nothing further 
was heard. 

And at about the same time a famous procuress came under 
suspicion of kidnapping: maidens from middle-class families and 
furnishing them to some Florentine noblemen. Questioned as to 
the names of her clients, she compromised such a quantity of dis- 
tinguished persons that there was no pursuing this inquest either, 
the dossiers had to be burned, and the woman forbidden to say 
any more. 

Nearly all the ladies of condition, in Florence, have the habit 

of vending their charms in brothels; their temperament and their 
. penury bring them to it. For the legal status of married women 
is singularly unfavoratle in Florence, perhaps worse here than 
in any other European city, and there are few where their profligacy 
is more extensive or rampant. As for the cicisbeo, his function is 


Juliette 2 625 


merely to provide her a screen; rarely does the cicisbeo enjoy any 
privileges with the woman he serves; appointed to his post as the 
husband’s friend, he accompanies the wife when she wishes to have 
him by her and obediently retreats when she orders him away. 
Those who fancy a cicisbeo is a paramour are greatly mistaken; he 
is simply the woman’s indulgent friend, or ally; may sometimes be 
the husband’s spy ; but never does he lie with her; and of all possible 
roles, this is the dreariest a man can assume in Italy. A wealthy 
foreigner has but to appear on the doorstep, and husband, gallant, 
and everybody else speedily retire, leaving a clear field to him upon 
whose purse all hopes are founded, and I have often seen the com- 
placent lord of the house quit it in consideration of a sequin or two 
when the stranger manifests the wish, however slight, to hold 
private parley with milady. 

I have inserted this brief sketch of Florentine manners in order 
that you apprehend in what way, touching the thieveries, the de- 
baucheries we were meditating, we were aided and in what way 
hampered by the traditional usages of this people at whose expense 
we wanted and were free to amuse ourselves for six months. 

Sbrigani felt that our schemes were likely to meet with fairer 
success if we ran up our flag over an emporium of debauchery 
rather than over a casino; perfidious greed insatiable! did we not 
have riches enough already without striking out anew toward 
crime? No doubt; but once one is a traveler of crooked paths does 
one ever renounce them for straight ? 

So we circulated information advising the public at large that 
gentlemen would find at any hour of the night or day not only 
pretty wenches awaiting them in our establishment, but even 
women of the highest quality, and it was likewise made known that 
ladies could always obtain from us what they required in men and 
young girls, for their clandestin: pleasures. Together with all 
that, we proposed the most agreeable surroundings, the most ex- 
quisite table; and the whole town rushed to us immediately. My 
companions and I were the mainstay of the house; but our clients 
had simply to make the request, they had simply to indicate the 
desire, and we put at their disposal everything delicious the district 
afforded. We charged exorbitant rates, but they were marvelous 
services we offered. Slise and Raimonde, trained in the matter, saw 


626 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to the misplacement of countless pocketbooks and pieces of jewelry; 
their depradations gave rise to a certain number of complaints, all 
futile, the protection from which we benefited was an impervious 
defense, rendering vain <1] the denunciations of our activities. 

Among the first we received was the Duke of Pienza. His 
passion was sufficiently cut of the ordinary to warrant describing. 
Sixteen girls the Duke must have, they were arranged by two’s, 
each pair being distinguished by a different coiffure. These girls 
were naked, so was I where I reclined upon a sofa beside him; 
sixteen musicians, all youthful, handsome, and naked also, were 
seated to the right. Each couple was to enter the room in turn; 
prior to its appearance, the Duke told me what lascivious pose or 
lewd act he expected from the couple, the orchestra was admitted 
into the secret, and it was from the music, its key, its tempo, 
its volume, its melody, the couple was to try to guess its instruc- 
tions. It guessed aright? the music would stop, the Duke would 
embugger the two clever girls. Did they fail to divine what was 
required of them—and cach couple had ten minutes for solving the 
puzzle—then when the time had expired the dunces were flogged 
red and raw by our libertine who, as I dare say you very well 
imagine, derived quite as much pleasure from their mistakes as 
from their correct penetration of his wishes. 

The game began: the funny fellow’s first wish was to have his 
prick sucked by both of the first two girls. In they came; faultlessly 
guided by a fugue, they guessed the secret, and were sodomized. 
The chore to which the second cquple was appointed was the lick- 
ing of my cunt, the girls’ efforts to interpret the music were un- 
availing, they were lasted. The third of the Duke’s secret wishes 
was to be lashed, and it was found out. The fourth, to frig the 
musicians’ sixteen pricks: the fourth couple was unlucky. The fifth, 
to shit in the middle or the room: the ten minutes passed and the 
whip was brought into play. The sixth pair of girls realized that 
they were to frig each other. The two composing the seventh 
couple altogether failed to grasp that they were to whip each other, 
and as a consequence were whipped by the Duke, vigorously. The 
music enabled the eighth couple to understand that the hero was 
to be embuggered with dildoes, and this was the moment he chose 


Juliette & 627 


to inject his own discharge into my bum. And there was an end 
to it. 

For some three months we had been leading this frivolous and 
profitable life when I accomplished a piece of outstanding baseness 
and thereby added a hundred thousand crowns to our treasury. 

Of all the women who frequented my house with the utmost 
assiduity, the wife of the Spanish ambassador was she whose 
debauchery was probably the most noteworthy. Married women, 
maids, boys, castrates, she could find a use for anything, and though 
young and of angelic beauty, the whore’s rapacity, her foulness 
were such that she would insist I fetch her common laborers off the 
street, gravediggers and sweeps, pickpockets, flunkeys, ragpickers, 
and whatever else I could lay my hands on that was lowbred, vile, 
and vulgar. When it was for women she longed then they must be 
sluts just risen stinking and sodden off a barracks-room floor, or 
worse yet if it might possibly be procured. Once encloseted with the 
rabble I collected for her, the rascal would be seven and eight 
hours frolicking in that leprous milieu, and then when she had had 
her fill of veneral pleasures would turn to those of the table, and 
close the day in mad riot amidst the most revolting debaucheries. 

The ambassadress had a very pious husband, a very jealous 
one whom she gave to believe that when she went out it was to 
visit a friend who, like herself, was also one of my more reliable 
clients. 

Seeing in all this certain promising possibilities, I one day 
take myself to the Embassy. 

“Excellency,” I say to the representative of Spain, “so good 
and upright a man as you does not deserve to be cuckolded: the 
woman who bears your name is not worthy of it. Your own honesty 
and rectitude cause you to doubt the truth of what I advance? So 
be it; but I entreat you, for the sake of your dignity, of your honor, 
of your peace of mind, Excellency, investigate the matter.” 

“Betrayed? I?” repeated the ambassador, “ ’tis unthinkable. 
I know my wife too well.” 

“Say you so, my Lord? Begging your pardon, I am persuaded 
of the contrary, and wager you are far from having even the faint- 
est glimmering of her appalling conduct. It needs to be seen to be 
believed. My object in coming here is to be of aid to you.” 


628 » THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Florella, troubled, wounded by the painful suspicions I have 
sowed in him, hesitates before the still more painful prospect of 
having them confirmed. And then, setting his chin purposefully, 
and showing himself more of a man than I would have thought, 
“Are you in a position, Madame, to prove these allegations?” 

“Today, my Lord, if you so wish it,” I answer. “Here is my 
card, I shall be expecting you toward five o'clock this afternoon. 
You shall see the style ‘n which your wife violates the trust you 
have in her, and the species of individuals she selects to that end.” 

The ambassador promises to be there. 

“I am flattered, Excellency, and satisfied; however,” I add, 
“TI should like to point out to you that the favor I am doing you 
shall cost me dear. For ’tis I who furnish men to her, and she pays 
me handsomely for them—you shall punish her, I presume, and 
in any case I shall henceforth be deprived of her custom: I feel I 
am entitled to an indemnity.” 

“True, that is only fair,” says Florella; “in what sum might it 
be?” 

“Fi fty thousand crowns ?” 

“This pocketbook contains that amount, I shall bring it with 
me and the money shall be yours when you have presented me with 
the necessary evidence.” 

‘“‘Agreed, my Lord. I shall expect you at five.” 

The several hours remaining until then were time enough to 
enable me to prepare further unhappiness for this ill-starred 
ménage. While causing the wife to fall into a trap, I was eager to 
snare the husband in it also; you shall soon learn by what crafty 
means I achieved this. After my little conference with the am- 
bassador I went straight to call upon his wife. 

“Madame,” said I, “you give yourself bother on account of 
your husband, thinking him of stern morality and irreproachable 
behavior you are ever apprehensive lest, finding you out, he up- 
braid you. I suggest that: you come to my house a little earlier than 
usual this afternoon, and it shall be revealed to you that conjugal 
ties no more prevent hin from enjoying himself than they do you. 
The spectacle will surely ease your conscience and doubtless induce 
you to put by the onerous precautions which gall your daily 
pleasures.” 


Juliette & 629 


“Do you know,” she replied, “I am less than entirely surprised 
by what you tell me, for I had an intuition he is not so sinless as he 
would appear; and I should be delighted to learn that my guesses 
have not been mistaken—” 

“You shall have them confirmed today. I have six pickpockets 
ready for you, and I have never clapped eyes on a prettier set of 
ruffans. Unless they are the three young boys your husband has 
ordered for tonight.” 

“The monster !” 

“He is a bugger.” 

“Ah ha! So indeed! That explains why he is eternally fussing 
and fumbling about my ass and always whining to be let into it. 
And that explains his eccentricities also . . . his unaccountable 
absences, and the handsome valets he surrounds himself with. .. . 
Oh, Juliette, I simply must catch him out. . . . I must learn the 
truth—you will help me, will you not?” 

“If you insist. But I am obliged to think of the future, 
Madame. Satisfying your curiosity, I lose a client and his trade is 
even more profitable to me than yours.” 

“Never mind, I shall make your losses up to you. Set a figure, 
Juliette, I am willing to pay anything if it will secure me an end to 
my anxieties and my persecutions.” 

“Then fifty thousand crowns does not strike you as too 
much ?” 

“You shall have the sum—the money is in this purse, I shall 
have it with me. So go now, and count upon me to keep the appoint- 
ment and the bargain.” 

The two rendezvous arranged, I hasten off to organize the 
comedy. The wife, according to my reckonings, was as good as 
snared already: her native libertinage would all unaided spell her 
downfall. As for the husband’s, however, that was by no means so 
simple to contrive. Art was called for here, seduction would be 
necessary: the man I was dealing with was a Spaniard, a pious 
Spaniard. But nothing daunted me. Once the two stages were set-— 
the two scenes were to transpire in adjoining chambers, a crack in 
the partition separating them would permit the husband to observe 
his wife’s infidelities; through a second aperture the wife would 
see her husband’s antics—I waited patiently for my two dupes. 


630 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


The husband arrived first. 

“My Lord,” I declared, “it would seem to me that in the light 
of your wife’s behavior you ought no longer feel constrained to 
deny expression to your tastes nor to refuse yourself pleasures.” 

Florella drew himself up. “Such things—” 

“You dislike them and you are quite right: the dangers are 
manifold when you dally with women. But, Excellency, look here, 
these pretty children,” sz.id I, drawing aside a curtain behind which 
I had stationed three delightful little boys, draped in garlands of 
roses and otherwise naked, “these heavenly little Ganymedes, you'll 
surely not maintain that sorrows are to be anticipated from enjoy- 
ing them? Really, my Lord, it surpasses my understanding—you 
who are so ill-used, will you worsen affairs by being harsh to your- 
self ?” 

And while I spoke the sweet little trio, acting upon my in- 
structions, surrounded tle Spaniard, hugged and kissed him, teased 
him and, despite all he could do, plucked his wavering virility forth 
from its tent. Man is weak. The pious are weaker than most, 
especially when you offer them boys. Seldom sufficiently stressed, 
often not even realized, there exists a powerful analogy between 
believers in God and bug zers. 

‘My Lord,” said I once things were well under way, “I am 
going to leave you to your own devices; | shall return as soon as 
your wife has begun her wanton capers. The sight of them ought to 
enable you to pursue your own in greater comfort.” 

And I leave just ir. time to greet the ambassadress, then on 
the point of entering. 

‘“‘Madame,” I whisper, conducting her to the hole in the wall, 
“you could not have come at a better moment. Behold in what way 
His Excellency passes his afternoons.” 

And indeed the good man, without an inkling of the scurvy 
trick being played upon him and seduced by my speeches, was almost 
naked now and already absorbed in the ethereal preludes of sod- 
omistic lubricity. 

“The beast!” gasped the ambassadress, ‘‘the fiend! Let him 
dare criticize my conduct after what I have just seen—ah, I'll have 
a thing or two to tell him! Juliette, it is dreadful, it is horrible— 


Juliette & 631 


madre de Dios, where are my men? Send in my men, I'll have my 
revenge, by heaven, I’ll have my revenge and more beside!” 

And having started Dona Florella off on her lewd routine, I 
rejoined her husband. 

‘“‘A thousand pardons if I disturb you, Excellency,” said I, 
“but the crucial instant is at hand and I should not like to have 
you miss it. Leave off your sweet sport a moment and come,” I 
urged him, steering Florella toward the second spyhole several 
feet away from the one through which he had been watched by his 
wife, “determine for yourself whether you are cornute or no.” 

“Great God!” that gentleman exclaimed, “with six men, and 
veritable scum of the earth besides! Oh, the slut: Juliette, take it, 
here is your money, this sight I have witnessed—I am thunder- 
struck, I am undone, I . . . can no more—away with these children, 
I wish never to hear of pleasures again. That monster in the 
next room has shattered my existence, slain the soul in me... I am 
in despair.” 

To me it was of no importance whether or not his lubricities 
reached their term, his wife had seen them begin, that was all I 
required. The aspect of the adventure my evil mind most appreci- 
ated was its sequel and it warmed the .cockles of my very bad heart 
afterward to learn that the ambassadress had been stabbed to death, 
an event which gave rise to great commotion. A hundred diplo- 
mats, the emissaries of that many rival states, promptly published 
colorful versions of the story and Florella was hailed before Leo- 
pold’s magistrates: unable to endure the assaults of remorse, unable 
to face the ignominy about to fall on his head, the Spaniard shot 
himself. But I had contributed nothing to this second death, I was 
scarcely better than its indirect cause. The thought left me fright- 
fully downcast; let me now tell you what I undertook several days 
later in order to pick up my spirits and at the same time promote 
my fortune. . 

It is common knowledge that the Italians make wide use of 
poisons: their atrociousness of character finds therein a suitable 
vehicle of expression, and a convenient means for taking the re- 
venge and serving the lust wherefor they have also acquired a name 
in the world. Sbrigani and I having exhausted the supply acquired 
long before from Madame Durand, I had lately entered into the 


632 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fabrication of those venoms for which she had given me the recipes: 
I sold these products in quantity, scores of people consulted me for 
their needs, and this branch of commerce developed into an im- 
mense source of revenue. 

A rather well-favored young man, by whom I had been fucked 
to perfection and who was a daily visitor to my house, besought 
me to provide him something for his mother: he could no longer 
abide her interference in his pleasures and the sooner she was out 
of the way, the sooner he would gain a considerable inheritance. 
Such were the solid reasons why he was resolved to be rid of that 
Argus forthwith, and as he was a person of staunch principles, he 
was able without scruple or hesitation to concert a deed which 
common sense dictated. And so he asked me for a violent toxin 
whose effect would be rapid. Instead, I sold him a slow one, and the 
day following the transaction I paid the mother a call. The poison, 
as I rightly assumed, mvst already have been administered, for my 
young man had been nothing if not eager to get down to business. 
But as its action would not be felt for another few days, no symp- 
tom was yet, manifest. I disclosed her son’s fell designs to the 
woman, describing them as intentions. 

“Madame,” I declzred, “your plight is unenviable, it is grave, 
and without my aid you are lost; but your son is not alone in this 
despicable plot against your life, his two sisters are involved 
also, and ’twas one of them who applied to me for the poison 
necessary to cut the thread of your days.” 

“What are these ghiastly things you tell me ?” 

“There are terrible truths to bare in this world, and ungrate- 
ful, nay, distressing is the mission of those who from love of man- 
kind are forced to reveal them. You must seek vengeance, Madame, 
and do so without delav. I have brought you that very drug your 
monstrous children mean to give you; use it upon them, be quick: 
they merit nothing less, an eye for an eye, Madame, retaliation in 
kind is the best justice of all. And hold your tongue, for you cannot 
without dishonor to yourself let it be known that your own flesh 
and blood have plotted your murder; avenge yourself in silence, 
you shall obtain satisfaction and avoid any stain. No, no, be as- 
sured of it, there is no wrong in turning against your would-be 
attackers the sword they are about to lift against you. To the con- 


Juliette & 633 


trary, smite down the wicked and you earn the praise of every 
good man.” 

And it was to the most vindictive woman in Florence I was 
speaking; of this I was aware. She takes my powders, she pays 
me gold. The very next day she mixes them into her children’s food, 
and as that particular poison was exceedingly strong, the brother 
and two sisters perished very shortly; and their mother followed 
them to the grave inside a week. All their funeral processions 
passed down the road before my house. 

“Sbrigani,” I said as the sounds of lamentation reached my 
ears and drew me to the window, “I behold a gladdening scene be- 
low; fuck me, dear friend, even as I gaze at what I have wrought. 
Hurry, Sbrigani, deliver me quickly of the hot sperm that has been 
a whole week simmering in my womb; I must absolutely discharge 
at the sight of my crimes.” 

Do you ask me why I included the woman’s two daughters in 
this hecatomb ? Then I shall answer you. They were of unsurpassed 
loveliness; for two long months I had tried everything under the 
sun to seduce them, and they had not’succumbed: was more needed 
to kindle my wrath? And is virtue not always reprehensible in the 
eyes of crime and infamy? 


No need to tell you, my friends, that in the thick of these 
perfidious villainies my personal lubricity hardly lay dormant. Hav- 
ing but to choose from among the superb men and the sublime 
women I procured for others, you may be sure that I sorted out 
the best for my own purposes before relegating the rest to my 
customers; but Italians stiffen poorly, neither big nor for long, and 
their health, always dubious, drove me into an exclusive sapphism. 
Countess Donis was in those days the richest, the most beau- 
tiful, the most elegant, and the most dissolute Lesbian Florence 
could boast; it was commonly supposed I was her kept companion, 
and the opinion was not without some basis in fact. 

Madame Donis was a widow of thirty-five, delightfully 
shaped, with a charming face, a clever mind, much wit, and many 
talents. Libertinage and interest were the sinews of my twofold 
attachment to her, together we indulged in the strangest, the most 


634 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


reckless, the most outlandish of impudicities. I had taught the 
Countess the art of whetting her pleasures upon the stone of cruel 
refinements, and the whore, deriving untold benefit from my ex- 
perience and instruction, was already almost a match for me in 
wickedness. 

“Oh, my friend,” she said to me one day, “how many and 
various are the desires aroused by the thought of a crime! I liken 
it to a spark which swiftly sets alight everything combustible at 
hand, whose ravages increase in proportion to the fuel it finds, and 
which ends up producing a blaze in us such as is not to be ex- 
tinguished save by rive:s of fuck. But, Juliette, some theory must 
exist governing this as there is a theory governing everything else, 
and it too must possess its principles, its rules. . .. I am eager to 
become familiar with them; -teach me, my angel, you know what my 
dispositions, my penchants are, teach me how to regulate all this.” 

‘Adorable woman,” I replied, “I am too devoted to my pupil 
to leave her only halfway educated. Lend me a little attention and I 
shall disclose to you the precepts which have led me to where you 
see me today. 

“They are these, beloved Countess. Whenever you have the 
urge to commit a crime, what are the general precautions to be 
observed, barring of course those particular ones which the nature 
of events alone must prescribe? 

“Firstly, combine your scheme several days ahead of time, 
thoroughly revolve and ponder all its consequences, some will con- 
tain advantages for you, spy them out, look with similar care for 
those likely to betray you, and weigh them as coolly as if it were 
inevitable that you be found out. If it be a murder you concert, re- 
member that in all the world no individual is so completely isolated 
that some acquaintance or friend or relative of his, however remote, 
may not bring you to eventual harm. These persons, whoever they 
are, will sooner or later come looking for your victim and, not find- 
ing him, finally come locking for you: hence, before you act prepare 
your welcome for them, your manner of replying to their questions 
and of imposing silence ‘pon them if they are not satisfied with your 
answers. Once ready to strike, do the thing alone if you possibly 
can; if you are forced to employ a confederate, see to it that he has 


Juliette & 635 


so much to gain from your crime, compromise him so vitally, 
bind him so fast to the deed that he cannot possibly turn against 
you later. Self-interest is the prime mover of human beings; thus, 
let there be no doubt of it, if you neglect these precautions and 
the accomplice finds a greater advantage in playing you false than 
in keeping faith with you, then be sure of it, my dear, betray you 
he shall, above all if he is weak and believes avowing may be a 
means to clearing his conscience. 

“If you are going to derive some profit from your crime, 
carefully hide this motive you have for committing it; when you 
are in company never give the faintest sign that it is among your 
preoccupations, a slip of the tongue, a stray remark dropped 
beforehand will be recalled afterward, and these words will always 
testify against you and very frequently, in the absence of better 
evidence, serve as proof. If the committed crime doubles your 
fortune, defer until much later the purchase of a new coach or 
necklace, the changes in your circumstances, outwardly displayed 
will arouse curiosity, incite comment, and bring the police around 
to your door. 

“The deed once done, you will be best advised, especially as a 
beginner, to avoid company for awhile, since the visage is the mirror 
of the soul and despite us the muscles that shape our facial ex- 
pression will inevitably, try as we will to prevent it, reflect our in- 
most feelings. For the same reason, see to it you introduce no sub- 
ject of conversation which has the slightest bearing upon the deed; 
for if it is the first time you have committed it, you are apt, as 
you discuss it, to wax rather too eloquent, to say that trifle too 
much which will incriminate you, and if to the contrary it is one of 
your habitual crimes, a crime that affords you pleasure, your 
physiognomy will announce to others the agreeable impression 
made upon you by anything touching the deed. In general, through 
practice strive to acquire enough control over your expression and 
reactions as finally to be master of them, and to be rid of the 
habit of displaying your secret emotions upon your face; calm and 
imperturbability and impassiveness should reign there, and train 
yourself to appear utterly unmoved even when gripped by the 
most pawerful feelings. Well, none of this is attained save through 
total habituation to vice, and a toughening of the soul in the last 


636 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


degree; both of these being of the highest necessity to you, I must 
keenly recommend them. 

“Were you not immune to remorse, and you will never ac- 
quire that immunity except through the habit of crime, were you 
not, I say, perfectly forearmed against all misgivings, all qualms, 
*twould be useless for you to endeavor to win control over your 
countenance, it would fal] on every occasion and betray you at 
every turn. Therefore, having done a piece of wickedness, do not 
rest on your laurels, Madame: you will be the unhappiest of women 
if you make only one sally into crime and call a halt there. Either 
stay quietly at home, or, having ventured to the brink of evil, leap 
boldly over the precipice. Only the accumulated weight of a mul- 
titude of misdeeds will stifle your capacity for remorse, will en- 
gender the sweet habituation which dulls it so wonderfully, and 
will provide you the mask you need in order to deceive others. And 
do not suppose you have anything to gain from attenuating the 
character of the crime you meditate, its greater or lesser atrocious- 
ness is irrelevant: it is not because of its atrocity a deed is punished, 
but because its author is cletected, and the more violent the crime 
the more precautions he is required to take. Thus it is virtually im- 
possible to realize a major crime without observing care for one’s 
safety, whereas this is tco easily left unheeded when the crime 
is petty, and that is why it is found out. A crime’s atrocity is of 
concern only to you, and can it concern you once your conscience 
is impervious to it? its discovery, however, is to your detriment, and 
should be scrupulously prevented. 

“Employ hypocrisy, it is indispensable in this world where 
accepted usage is hardly to practice what you preach: crimes 
are rarely imputed to those who manifest a general indifference 
toward everything that happens. Not everyone is so unhappy nor 
so clumsy as Tartuffe. Ner furthermore is it, like Tartuffe, to the 
point of enthusiasm for virtues one should carry one’s hypocrisy, 
you need go no farther than indifference to crime: you do not wor- 
ship virtue, but neither are: you fond of vice, and this kind of hypoc- 
risy is never detected, because it leaves the pride of others in 
peace, which the sort of hypocrisy that distinguishes Moliére’s hero 
necessarily offends. 

“Be just as careful to avoid witnesses as you would be in 


Juliette 2 637 


the choice of accomplices, and whenever possible dispense with 
both. It is always the one or the other and often the two together 
who lead the criminal to the scaffold.* Well-laid plans and sound 
technique spare you from having to do with people of that sort. 
Never say my son, my valet, my wife will never betray me, for if 
such persons want to, they can do you unlimited harm even if 
they do not denounce you to the law whose guardians may also be 
bought. 

“Above all never have recourse to religion: you are lost if you 
put yourself back under its sway, it will torment you, it will fill your 
heart with quakings and your head with illusions and you will end 
up becoming your own delator and worst enemy. All these things 
weighed and arranged in due order, and this methodically, objec- 
tively, rationally (for I am willing enough to have you conceive 
the crime in the throes of passion, indeed, I even urge you to, but 
I insist that, conjured up in frenzy, it be prepared in calm), now 
cast a clear eye upon yourself, see who you are, gauge your faculties, 
evaluate your forces, your assets, your influence, your station; de- 
termine the extent of your vulnerability before the law, the worth 
of the defenses you can interpose between yourself and its attacks. 
And if after this survey you find yourself on safe ground, go ahead; 
but once the die is cast, act forthwith. The best laid plans may mis- 
carry, know it in advance; if you have done everything prudence 
demands, and if still you are are found out, face‘ the situation 
bravely. For what indeed is the worst that can befall you now? A 
very mild and a very quick death. And better that it should be 
on a gallows than in your bed; truly, the sufferings are nothing by 
comparison, and it is all much sooner over with; disgrace? But 
what does disgrace matter? you'll not feel it, the dead feel noth- 
ing, and as for what may be felt by your family, can this alarm 
you, a philosophic individual, who worries precious little about 
families? Do you dread hearing yourself reproached, supposing 
now that they let you live and are content to castigate you? What? 
you shudder at the thought of a few idle invectives and a tarnished 


3 Very great, says Machiavelli, must be the accomplice’s devotion if the personal 
danger he sees himself exposed to is not greater still; which proves that you must 
either select for your lieutenant someone related very intimately to you, or destroy 
him when you are finished with his services. (Discersi, Lib. III, Cap. 6.)

name? Fie! you tremble before less than a spook. Honor ? What is 
honor? A meaningless word, of itself nothing, which for its 
existence depends upon the opinion of others and which, so defined, 
should neither flatter us when it is accorded nor be regretted when 
it is lost. Let Epicurus’ a:titude be our own: bestowed upon us from 
the outside, so much the better if fame and honor be ours, so much 
the worse if not, in this t 1ere is nought we can do save know how to 
get on without them when we cannot acquire them. And be ever 
mindful that there is no crime on earth, however modest, which 
does not bring its perpetrator more pleasure than dishonor or 
disgrace can bring him pain. Am I any the less alive for being so- 
cially blemished? What care I for a little mud spattered upon me 
if beneath it I preserve my comfort and my faculties intact! ’Tis 
therein I find my happiness, and not in an opinion I cannot create 
nor amend nor retain, and which is meaningless and vain, since it is 
an everyday spectacle to see people stripped of every vestige of 
honor and fame nevertheless achieve an existence, a consideration 
which feeble simpletons never attain after a lifetime of dogged 
virtuousness. 

“Such, my dear Countess, are the views I would express to a 
vulgar auditor. But you—your rank, your person, your wealth, 
your credit, in what an enviable position they place you, how they 
shelter you from interference and ensure your impunity: you are 
beyond the reach of the law thanks to your birth, of religion 
thanks to your enlightenment, of remorse thanks to your in- 
telligence. No, no, there is not a single extravagance you should 
refrain from, not one form of wild conduct you should not blindly 
indulge in. 

“However, I cannot repeat it too often: avoid scandal, it 
brings on trouble every time and never increases pleasure one jot; 
and this too I shall tell you again and again: select your accom- 
plices judiciously, since at: this early stage you must have them. You 
are rich, fee them well; bound by your munificence, they shall not 
desert your cause; and if they dared, ’twould be to what peril for 
them ? would you not have them arrested and punished long before 
punishment could overtake you? That same bond which to others 
is a deterrent as formidable as any forged of steel, is, do you see, 
a twine of flowers lying light upon you. 


Juliette 3 639 


“This has been, I know, something of a sermon; let me now 
indicate to you, my lovely friend, the secret of how to discover 
which kind of crime is likely to fit your temperament best, for 
you can do nothing properly unless you enjoy it. A woman organized 
as you are cannot but be subject to incessant criminal impulsions; 
before divulging my secret, however, allow me to explain to you 
how I come to this conclusion about your temperament. 

“Your power of feeling is extreme, but you have directed the 
effects of your sensibility in such a way that it can no longer move 
you to anything except vice. All external objects possessing some 
unusual feature or other provoke a prodigious irritation in the 
electrical particles of your neural humour, and the impact de- 
livered to the nervous system is instantly communicated to the 
nerves in the vicinity of the pleasure zone; you become immediately 
conscious of an itch there, this prickly titillating sensation is agree- 
able to you, you welcome it, you cultivate it, you renew it; your 
imagination sets to contriving ways to intensify it, means to amplify 
it... the irritation grows ever keener, and thus, if you wish, do 
you multiply your enjoyments ad infinitum. Your sole aim and 
study is to extend, to aggravate your sensations—need I say more? 
Perhaps. One who has vanquished every obstacle, as you have done, 
and freed herself from every restraint must perforce go far: only 
the most stimulating and gravest excess, the most odious, the most 
contrary to every law human and divine, is now capable of igniting 
your imagination. And so I must advise you to keep yourself a little 
in hand since, alas, the opportunities for crime are not always 
present each time we have the need to commit it, and Nature, 
having given us souls of fire, ought at least to furnish us somewhat 
more fuel. Is is not true, my beauty, that you have already and, it 
may well be, often found your desires far in advance of your 
means ?”’ 

“Oh yes, yes,” sighed the ravishing Countess. 

“Just as I thought. It is a frightful situation, many, many 
are the times I have been in it too, it is the bane of my existence; 
but let me impart my secret.*

this paragraph; may he then extract all possible benefit from what precedes and

“Go a whole fortnight without lewd occupations, divert your- 
self, amuse yourself at other things; for the space of those two 
weeks rigorously bar every libertine thought from your mind. At the 
close of the final day retire alone to your bed, calmly and in silence; 
lying there, summon up all those images and ideas you banished 
during the fasting period just elapsed, and indolently, languidly, 
nonchalantly fall to performing that wanton little pollution by which 
nobody so cunningly arouses herself or others as do you. Next, un- 
pent your fancy, let it freely dwell upon aberrations of different 
sorts and of ascending magnitude; linger over the details of each, 
pass them all one by one in review; assure yourself that you are ab- 
solute sovereign in a world groveling at your feet, that yours is the 
supreme and unchallengeable right to change, mutilate, destroy, an- 
nihilate any and all the living beings you like. Fear of reprisals, 
hindrances you have none: choose what pleases you, but leave noth- 
ing out, make no.excepticns ; show consideration to no one whomso- 
ever, sever every hobbling tie, abolish every check, let nothing stand 
in your way; leave everything to your imagination, let it pursue its 
bent and content yourself to follow in its train, above all avoiding 
any precipitate gesture: let it be your head and not your tempera- 
ment that commands your fingers. Without your noticing it, from 
among all the various scenes you visualize one will claim your 
attention more energetically than the others and will so forcefully 
rivet itself in your mind that you'll be unable to dislodge it or 
supplant it by another. “The idea, acquired by the means I am out- 
lining, will dominate you, captivate you; delirium will invade your 
senses, and thinking yourself actually at work, you will discharge 
like a Messalina. Once this is accomplished, light your bedside 
lamp and write out a full description of the abomination which has 
just inflamed you, omitting nothing that could serve to aggravate 
its details; and then go to sleep thinking about them. Reread your 
notes the next day and. as you recommence your operation, add 
everything your imagination, doubtless a bit weary by now of an 
idea which has already cost you fuck, may suggest that could 
heighten its power to exacerbate. Now turn to the definitive shaping 


from what follows it upon the way of living delightfully the kind of life Nature 
has appointed him to, and may he be persuaded that these counsels are those of a 
person-who speaks from experience. 


Juliette & 641 


of this idea into a scheme and as you put the final touches on it, once 
again incorporate all fresh episodes, novelties, and ramifications 
that occur to you. After that, execute it, and you will find that this 
is the species of viciousness which suits you best and which you will 
carry out with the greatest delight. My formula, I am aware, has 
its wicked side but it is infallible, and I would not recommend it to 
you if I had not tested it successfully. 

“Lovely and delicious friend,” I went on, remarking the warm 
impression my lessons were making upon her, ‘permit me to append 
yet a few more observations to the advice I have just offered you; 
my single interest is in your happiness, my desire is to labor in its 
behalf. 

“When once one has decided to commit a crime of amusement, 
it is of utmost importance, firstly, that it be given all the scope 
whereof it is susceptible; secondly, that it be of such force as to be 
forever beyond reparation. This latter characteristic is all the more 
important in that it eliminates any room for remorse; for when 
one feels remorseful, that feeling is almost always accompanied by 
the consoling thought that one can somehow palliate or by means 
of reparations efface the evil one has done. This idea sends remorse 
off to sleep, but only to sleep; at the very first mishap, the slightest 
illness, or simply when the passions are stilled, remorse reawakes 
and drives you to despair; if however the act committed is of a 
kind that leaves you without a shadow of a hope of repairing it, your 
reason annihilates remorse. What is the use of crying over spilt 
milk? The proverb is logical; by frequently repeating it to yourself 
you will shortly obliterate your capacity for remorse altogether, 
and you may then venture into any situation without subsequently 
being annoyed by its pangs. Adding to this an intense criminal ac- 
tivity, you will achieve a flawless inward serenity. On the one hand, 
the impossibility of reparation, on the other, that of making out 
which of your crimes you ought to repent most, and the conscience, 
first dizzied, then rendered incoherent, is finally reduced to utter 
silence; thus we see that conscience is distinct from all other mal- 
adies of the soul, it dwindles away to nothingness as more is added 
to itt. 

‘These elementary principles of mine well assimilated, you are 
ready to undertake anything and should stop at nothing. Ad- 


642 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


mittedly, you will not be able to procure yourself this peaceful 
situation save at the expense of others; but you will procure it. And 
of what account are others when it is a question of oneself! If from 
immolating three million human victims you stand to gain no livelier 
pleasure than that to be had from eating a good dinner, slender 
though this pleasure may appear in the light of its price, you ought 
to treat yourself to it without an instant’s hesitation; for if you 
sacrifice that good dinner, the necessary result is a privation for 
you, whereas no privation results from the disappearance of the 
three million insignificant creatures you must do away with to 
obtain the dinner, because loetween it and you there exists a relation- 
ship, however tenuous, whereas none exists between you and the 
three million victims. Well now, put case that the pleasure you 
expect from destroying them ceases to be tepid and becomes one of 
the most voluptuous sensations your soul can experience; how now, 
I ask you, how can there be any thinkable alternative to committing 
the crime at once ?° 

“Everything hinges upon the total annihilation of that absurd 
notion of fraternity whose existence they inculcate in us in the course 
of our upbringing. Completely demolish this fictitious link, remove 
yourself completely from its influence, convince yourself that be- 
tween your self and some other self no connection whatever exists, 
and you will observe you- pleasures expand while simultaneously 
your faculty of remorse w thers. That one of your fellow creatures 
is subject to a dolorous sensation is of no importance provided the 


5 We may elucidate this idea by saying that the good dinner may be the source 
of some physical delight, and tha! saving the lives of the three million victims would 
cause only moral delight, even to an honest spirit; which establishes a great difference 
between these two pleasures; for moral delights are mere intellectual enjoyments, 
uniquely dependent upon opinion, arbitrary and doubtful, and this to the point that 
a vicious spirit senses none of the enjoyments of virtue; corporeal delights, however, 
are physical sensations, upon which opinion has absolutely no bearing at all, and 
which are similarly felt by all human beings and for that matter by animals too; 
whence it proceeds that preserving those three million people from death would be a 
pleasure no more substantial thar: the flimsy prejudice it is founded upon, and which 
only a small fraction of humanity would feel; while the dinner would be a pleasure 
felt by everybody, and hence far superior; wherefrom it is plain to be seen that were 
the choice even between a gumdrop and the entire universe, any wavering would be 
equally illogical and inexcusable. This argument serves to demonstrate the immense 
advantages of vice over virtue. 


Juliette 643 


result is not a dolorous sensation for you. This then would be a case 
in which three million victims sent to their doom must be a matter 
of indifference to you; you ought not hence to oppose their destruc- 
tion even if you are able to prevent it, since from their loss Nature 
gains; but it is exceedingly important that this destruction occur if 
it affords you delight, because between it and your pleasure there is 
no proportion : everything must be to the advantage of the sensation 
you taste. You ought hence to concert this destruction resolutely and 
without remorse if you can achieve it with prudence; not that 
prudence is a virtue in itself, but the advantages you derive from it 
give it a value; and not that prudence is always necessary, for it 
often has a chilling effect upon pleasures. But it must nonetheless 
be employed in certain cases because it ensures impunity, and the 
certitude that you will get away scot-free enormously enhances the 
charms of crime; however, what with your wealth, the consideration 
and the credit you enjoy, your position is already strong and you 
need be less concerned for security than another. And so_you may 
fling caution more or less to the winds, and banish prudence when it 
looks to you likely to blunt your pleasures.” 

Filled with enthusiasm by my discourse, the Countess’ thousand 
kisses expressed her gratitude. 

‘I am eager to try out your secret,” said she; “let’s not meet 
again until two weeks have passed. I swear to see no one during 
that interval, when it is over we shall spend a night together: I 
shall tell you my ideas and we shall work jointly at their realiza- 
tion.” 

As she had promised, the Countess sent me word a fortnight 
later; we sat down to an exquisite supper. After we had raised our 
spirits with dainties of all kinds and delicious wines, the servants 
were dismissed, the doors locked, and we shut ourselves up in a 
little chamber which much art and expense had turned into a veri- 
table laboratory for lubricious research. 

Throwing herself straight into my arms, “Oh, Juliette,” the 
Countess said, “I need such tenebrous surroundings as these if I 
am to gather courage to confess what your perfidious prescriptions 
have brought me to. Perhaps never was a more atrocious crime 
conceived, it is appalling, words fail me . . . but my cunt seeps 
while I plot it .. . I discharge as I visualize myself performing it. 


644 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


. .. Oh, my love, however shall I be able to reveal this horror to 
you! Whither are we borne by a disordered imagination! To what 
infernal lengths is not a weak and helpless mortal dragged by 
satiety, by the abandonment of principles, by the atrophy of con- 
science, by the taste for vice, by the immoderate use of lust. . . 
Juliette, I have a mother and a daughter, you know that.” 

“Of course.” 

“The one, that woman who carried me in her womb, today 
scarcely fifty years of age, is yet in possession of all beauty’s traits. 
She adores me. Aglaia. my daughter, sixteen years old—Aglaia 
whom I idolize, with waom I have been frigging myself daily for 
the past two years, just as my mother did with me—well, Juliette, 
these two creatures... .”' 

“Go on.” 

“These two women whom I ought so to cherish, who ought to 
be so precious to me—I{ wish to steep my hands in their blood. I 
wish to bathe in it, Juliette; you and I, that is what I wish, you 
and I, lying together in a bathtub, each frigging the other, I want 
the blood of those two whores to drench us, I want it to cascade 
over us, I want us both to be covered by it, I want us to swim in 
it... these two women I worshiped before I met you and whom I 
loathe today, I want them to die while we watch, and in that 
manner. ... I want us to take fire from their dying breaths; I want 
them to be thrown deacl into that same bathtub, upon their corpses 
and in their blood, I want it to be there our pleasures culminate.” 

Countess Donis, who while making this avowal had been 
frigging herself uninterruptedly, now fainted as she discharged. 
Being myself singularly aroused by what I had just heard, I had no 
easy time reviving her she embraced me anew upon opening her 
eyes. 

i “Juliette,” she said, “the things I told you are frightful, but 
from the state they have put me in you can appreciate their prodi- 
gious effect upon my senses. . . . Do I repent having spoken? Far 
from it, I shall carry out the whole of what I have conceived, and 
promptly: we must busy ourselves at this infamy tomorrow.” 

“Sweet friend, del‘ cious friend,” I said to this engaging person, 
“you are not afraid, heaven forbid! of finding a censor in me. Far 
be it from me to carp at your project, but I ask that it be explored 


Juliette & 645 


to the limit and enriched by a few episodes. It strikes me that some 
spices could be included in the dish. In what manner do you mean 
to have your victims wet us with their blood? Is it not essential to 
your complete enjoyment that nothing short of the most excruciat- 
ing tortures cause it to flow?” 

“Ah,” was the Countess’ vibrant reply, “you think that my 
perversity has not already invented them, arranged them? I wish 
these tortures to be equally prolonged, gruesome, and violent, I 
wish to feast ten whole hours upon their hideousness and upon the 
victims’ groans and curses, I wish to have us discharge twenty times 
while first the one, then the other is adying, glutting ourselves on 
their screams, drinking ourselves drunk on their tears. Ah, Juliette,” 
the inspired woman pursued, masturbating me with the same ardor 
she employed for defiling herself, “all this to which my heart gives 
vent is nought but the fruit of your advice and instructions. This 
cruel but saving truth entitles me to your indulgence. So hark to 
what I have still to say: having gone so far as to disclose these 
dangerous desires I harbor I cannot now beg off, but must complete 
my confession and at the same time solicit your aid in an affair of 
great importance to me. Aglaia is the child of my husband, that is 
my reason for hating her; my sentiments for her father were no 
less hostile, and had Nature not heeded my prayers I would have 
resorted to art and forced her to fulfill them . . . you catch my 
drift. I have another daughter, a man I worship is her father. 
Fontange, so is she called, the darling issue of my passion and its 
token, she is now in her thirteenth year; she is being raised at 
Chaillot, near Paris. My desire is that she have a brilliant future, 
this requires means and means she shall not lack. Here, Juliette,” 
continued Madame Donis, handing me a bulging pocketbook, 
“my legitimate heirs will be deprived of these five hundred thousand 
francs; invest the sum in my Fontange’s name when you return to 
France, I wish also to entrust her to you, you will look after her, 
you will find a suitable match for her, you will see to her welfare 
and happiness. But your interest in the child must appear to stem 
from benevolence. Otherwise all would soon be brought to light: 
my family would assert claims to this gift, and lawyers would 
contrive to get it away from my daughter. I place my confidence in 
you, dear Juliette: swear that you will be a loyal friend to me and 


646 <Q THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


keep secret both my good and my evil deeds. This pocketbook 
contains an added fifty thousand francs which I beg you to have 
the kindness to accept for yourself. So then, swear to serve as the 
executioner of the two persons I have marked for death and at the 
same time as the protectress of the charming creature I place in 
your care—speak. Oh, Juliette, I am prepared to have faith in you 
—have you not told me a hundred times over that there is honor 
amongst rakes ? will you give this maxim the lie? No, surely not... 
my love, I am waiting for your reply.” 

Although infinitely less likely to keep a promise to cooperate 
in an act of generosity than in a crime, each of the propositions the 
Countess made me had its interesting side, and I agreed to both. 

“Dear friend,” I said to Madame Donis after sealing our 
pact with a kiss, “it shall be as you will it: be certain that before a 
year is out your beloved Fontange shall be the beneficiary of your 
generosity and of my devoted attentions. But for the present, my 
dearest, pray let us concentrate our thoughts upon executing your 
abominable designs. Virtue fairly turns my stomach when my soul 
is oriented toward crime-—”’ 

“Ah, Juliette,” said Madame Donis, plucking at my sleeve, 
“you perhaps disapprove my laudable action?” 

“Why no, surely not,” I hastily replied, and I had my reasons 
for reassuring the lady, ‘‘no, of course not, I disapprove of nothing 
at all but simply feel that there is a proper time and place for each 
of these so dissimilar subjects.” 

“Very well then, we shall give all our thought to the one which 
has just had such potent effects upon me. There is the question of 
details: let us compare our ideas. I have a few in mind, but tell me 
yours first: I want to see if our imaginations are in tune.” 

“To begin with,” I replied, “the scene must transpire not here 
in town but in a rural setting, cruel pleasures are most successful in 
the silence and peacefulness only the countryside can provide. And 
then let me ask you, is Aglaia a virgin?” 

“Most assuredly.” 

‘Her maidenhead should then be lost upon the altars of 
murder ; her two mothers must present her to the sacrificer, and—” 

‘‘And her sufferings must be ghastly |” the Countess interjected. 

“By all means, but rather than settle their specific kind before- 


Juliette eb 647 


hand it is probably better that we wait and see what actual circum- 
stances suggest. Arising spontaneously from the context, they will 
be a thousand times more voluptuous.” 

The rest of the night was given over to the most frenzied 
Lesbian exercises. We kissed each other, sucked each other, de- 
voured each other; each fitted with a dildo, we fenced fiercely, 
mercilessly, and for hours. And having completed our arrangements 
to remove for several days to Prato, where the Countess had a 
superb estate, we deferred the execution of our delicious scheme 
until the following week. 

Madame Donis adroitly announced to her mother and 
daughter that they were all embarking upon a six-month journey, 
thereby preparing the ground for the sad report that the two dear 
ones her fury was to destroy had been taken away by some illness 
in the course of their travels. For my part I was to bring Sbrigani 
and two thoroughly reliable valets. Thus upon the appointed day 
were met at Prato a total of eight persons: the Countess and I, my 
husband and my two hirelings, Madame Donis’ mother, her 
daughter and, lastly, an elderly nursemaid who had been many 
years in the service of her disorders. 

Hitherto I had seen Aglaia upon but one or two brief occa- 
sions, only now was I able to examine her closely. She proved a 
perfectly enchanting young thing, as pretty as a picture, gracefully 
made, with a skin incredibly smooth and soft and fair, big blue eyes 
which seemed to be only waiting to come alive, faultless teeth, 
golden tresses. But to all that direction was lacking, it drifted aim- 
lessly: the Graces had set only a caressing hand to Aglaia, she yet 
required molding. The impression made upon me by that heavenly 
girl is something beyond my power to describe, it was an age since 
anyone had stirred me so profoundly. 

And as I gazed at her a thought entered my head. 

“Why not change the victim,” I said to myself, ‘is not the 
commission the Countess has entrusted to me her death warrant? 
If I sincerely desire to steal this money—and the urge is undeniably 
upon me—then must I not straightway do her to death who assigned 
it to my safekeeping? My purpose in coming here is to commit 
crimes, that which ends the daughter’s days satisfies only my 
libertinage, whereas another which lays her mother low will stimu-

late my passions just as well and will amply content my greed into 
the bargain: the five hundred thousand francs will be mine, and I 
will be dispensed from zny obligation to account for them, mine 
also shall be two pretty girls to use as I please and, finally, I shall 
have murdered their mother who nicely twiddled my clitoris for a 
time, and of whom I have now had enough. As for the grandmother, 
bah, we can kill her too, there'll be nothing to it; but this charming 
and virtually unknown creature I behold before me, ’twould be a 
pity not to spare her unzil familiarity has had a chance to breed 
contempt.” 

I communicated these ideas to my husband, he applauded them 
and recommended that I send immediate word to my women, in- 
structing them to pack ud our belongings and to proceed with all 
dispatch to Rome and to await us there, for that was the city we 
had chosen for our next stay after our allotted term in Florence 
expired. Attached to me as Elise and Raimonde were, I could expect 
them to comply punctually and conscientiously with my orders, and 
was not disappointed. The very same day I convinced Madame 
Donis that to ensure the safe and satisfactory accomplishment of 
the task at hand it was indispensable to clear the house of every 
servant and to have all she owned of gold and gems sent down to 
the country so that she no: be entirely without resources in the event 
plans went somehow astray. Acclaiming the wisdom of these pre- 
cautions, Madame Donis, in blissful ignorance of those I was 
taking at the same time, :rranged to have all her acquaintances in 
Florence informed that she had gone off to Sicily and would be 
absent until late in the fall; and keeping by her only the old nurse 
I mentioned a moment ago, the improvident creature put herself 
entirely in our power: even had she deliberately tried she could not 
have tumbled more unerringly into all the traps we were laying for 
her. Everything was settled the next day, and the Countess, ours, 
had received by courier six hundred thousand francs in effects, two 
million in bank notes, and three thousand sequins in cash; her 
whole defense consisted n one aged woman, whereas my forces 
included, apart from Sbrigani, a pair of strapping valets. 

These dispositions completed and as I was enormously relish- 
ing my idea of having the daughter commit the very crime whereof 
her mother wished to make her the victim, I induced the Countess 


Juliette & 649 


to postpone all action until the following Friday, which, said I, 
would allow us three or four days to entrench ourselves in the 
appropriate calm. 

“Between now and then,” I suggested to her, “let us employ 
ruse, constraint only if need be. Since we are on the eve of losing 
this delightful Aglaia you have only now introduced to me and to 
whom I shall have to bid adieu so soon, let me at least pass these 
few remaining nights with the child.” 

All I said, all I asked, all I proposed was law to the Countess, 
such was her infatuation with me that nothing could have opened 
her eyes. And such are the mistakes which they who are in the 
midst of meditating wickedness are only too prone to make: daz- 
zled by their passions, they are completely blind to everything else 
and, thoroughly persuaded that their accomplices are going to de- 
rive as much benefit or pleasure as they from the deeds in question, 
they are oblivious of anything that might dim others’ enthusiasm 
for the project they dote upon. Madame Donis consented to 
everything; Aglaia was ordered to give me a warm reception in 
her bed, and I repaired thither that same evening. Oh, my friends, 
what an array of charms! Suspect me neither. of poetic license nor 
unreasoning bias, for truly I do not exaggerate when I declare to 
you that Aglaia would all alone have sufficed to him who in his 
search for a model ransacked all Greece and even in the one 
hundred loveliest women of that land failed to find the beauties he 
needed for the composition of the sublime Venus I admired in the 
Grand Duke’s gallery. Never, no, never had I seen forms so de- 
liciously rounded, an ensemble so voluptuous, nor details so com- 
pelling; nothing so narrow as her sweet little cunt, nothing so 
chubby as her dear little ass, nothing so pert, so fresh, so winningly 
shaped as her breasts; and fully aware of what it is I am saying, 
and stating it as a cold fact, I do now assure you that Aglaia was 
the divinest creature with whom up until that time I had ever had 
anything carnal to do. No sooner had I brought these marvels to 
light than I devoured them with caresses, and in my swift passage 
from one to the next, each time it seemed to me that I ought to 
have paused longer over what I had just relinquished for something 
equally wonderful. The pretty little minx had as lascivious a tem- 
perament as you could wish for, and was soon sighing her heart 


650 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


away. Her mother’s pupil, she frigged me like Sappho; but my 
studied languors, my voluptuous distress, my ecstatic sufferings, my 
twitchings, my nervous tremors, my spasms, my screams, my foul 
tirades, all these attributes of far-reaching corruption, all these 
symptoms of the havoc wrought by Nature in a body and a soul, 
my grimaces, my sugared, my sickly smiles and kisses, my sneaking 
gestures and insinuating remarks, my hoarse, lewd whisperings, all 
these amazed and then alarmed her gentle innocence, and she ended 
up avowing to me that her mother’s style of enjoyment was a great 
deal less refined, at any rate milder, than mine. Finally, after hours 
of matchless voluptuousness, after having discharged in every 
imaginable manner, five or six times in each, after having kissed, 
sucked each other everywhere, after having exchanged nips, bites, 
pinches, tonguings, whippings, after having done, in short, every- 
thing that can possibly be invented of the utterly crapulous, the 
utterly unbridled, the utterly obscene, and the simply inconceivable, 
to this delightful girl I spoke more or less as follows. 

“Dear girl,” I began, “I do not know where you stand as 
regards principles, nor whether the Countess, when she started to 
initiate you into the mysteries of pleasure, concerned herself also 
for the cultivation of yo:r soul; but whatever the case may be, that 
which I have to reveal to you is too important to be withheld 
another minute from your knowledge. Your mother, that most 
traitorous, that most unworthy, that most criminal of women, has 
plotted against your life—exactly, do not interrupt me—: tomor- 
row, Aglaia, you are to be her victim unless you parry the blow: by 
which I mean you have no choice but to strike it first.” 

“Good heaven, what fearful thing do you tell me?” said 
Aglaia, trembling in my arms. 

“The truth, my dove, it is atrocious, but I could not hide it 
from you.” 

“TI wonder if this could be the reason for the odd change in her 
attitude toward me of late... for her chilliness, for that treat- 
ment—”’ 

‘To what treatment do you refer ?” 

Aglaia then disclosed to me that her mother, become cruel in 
her pleasure, had been tormenting her, slapping her, beating her, 
and taken to saying the harshest things to her. Curious to know 


Juliette ee 651 


the precise degree of disorder and license that characterized 
Madame Donis’ lewd commerce with her daughter, I discovered 
that she required of the child one of those libidinous excesses whose 
violence brings disgust in its wake. After having gone down the list 
of libertine practices, this indecent mother had now come to the 
point where she had no pleasure from her daughter save in the 
form of a mouthful of her shit, which she would swallow. 

“Dear love,” I said to the maiden, “you would have been 
wiser to have been somewhat more sparing of the favors you 
granted your mother; too little reserve on your part, an overly 
accommodating spirit have resulted in satiety on hers. But the past 
cannot be altered, you must ready yourself for what is to come. The 
fatal hour is at hand.” 

“But how am I to escape ?” 

“Of escape there can be no question. You cannot wait until 
the attack is delivered and then hope to dodge it; my advice to you 
is to take the offensive yourself.” 

And here I began truly to enjoy the little piece of mischief I 
was up to; I had arrived at Prato with no fairer prospect than 
aiding a scoundrel to satisfy one of her passions; and now I was 
suborning an essentially mild-tempered and virtuous girl, I was 
urging her on to matricide, and however the deed might be justifi- 
able, was it not a crime withal ? While as for the trick I was playing 
upon my friend, it positively filled me with glee. 

Impressionable, delicate, sensitive, Aglaia was sorely shaken 
by my revelation and reduced to tears by this awful deed I proposed 
that she do. 

“My child,” said I, stroking her hair as she sobbed upon my 
breast, “this is no time for tears, ’tis courage and determination 
we require. Owing to her fell designs, Madame Donis has for- 
feited title to any of the consideration which might be shown a 
mother, and become an ordinary woman to be done quickly and 
remorselessly away with: to deprive of life those who threaten our 
own is the summit of human virtue. You do not suppose gratitude 
can bind you to an abominable woman who only gave you life in 
order to place it in jeopardy? Come, sweet Aglaia, don’t be mis- 
taken, if you owe anything to such a monster it is vengeance; can 
you passively turn the other cheek to be insulted and hope to retain 


652 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


your self-respect ? And supposing you were to survive this present 
attempt, what security remains to you? You will be your mother’s 
victim tomorrow if she fails to kill you today. Rash child, thought- 
less child, open your eyes: can you be ashamed to shed such criminal 
blood? Can you yet cling: to the illusion that between this villain 
and thee there still subsists any relation save that of the hunter to 
his quarry?” 

“You were her friend ?”’ 

“Could I continue to be once I learned that she was bent on 
destroying all I love in this world?” 

“Your tastes and passions resemble hers.” 

“Perhaps; but, unlike her, I do not venerate crime; unlike her, 
I am not a she-wolf thirsting for blood, I abhor cruelty; I love my 
fellow man, and murder is an infamy that revolts me. An end to 
such comparisons, Aglaia, an end to them, they are pointless, they 
dishonor me, and they are causing us to lose precious moments. The 
time for words is over, trat for deeds is upon us.” 

‘What! You would have me, Aglaia, thrust a dagger into my 
mother’s heart?” 

“A mother, say you? Can you call by that name the one who 
labors at the destruction of her child? Why no, having become your 
mortal enemy, this woman must be considered a mad beast fit only 
for extermination.” 

And taking Aglaia in my arms again, I strove to bury her 
misgivings beneath an avalanche of libertine attentions: and sure 
enough, she forgot her qualms by and by and, quite won over, 
promised everything. * Guided by my pernicious reasonings, the 


6 There is truly no limit to what one may obtain from women simply by causing 
them to discharge. Experience shows that one has only to make their cunts leak a few 
drops of fuck, and they are ready and eager for the most revolting atrocities; and if 
those women who have a native fondness for hideous crimes cared to reflect a little 
upon their emotions, they would admit the astonishingly powerful connection that 
exists between physical emotion: and moral aberrations. The wiser for recognizing 
this, the sum of their pleasures would henceforth increase by leaps and bounds, since 
they would correctly situate the germ of voluptuousness in the disorders which they 
could from then on carry to whatever extreme their lust might demand. I give an 
illustration. Arsinoe had but a single pleasure, that of fucking. A libertine lover 
mounts her; and chooses the moment of her ecstasy to suggest a criminal scheme to 
her. Whereat Arsinoe notices that her joys increase tenfold; she does what he pro- 
poses, and the heat engendered by this crime adds to the fire of her lust: Arsinoe has

heavenly little slut reached the stage where it dawned upon her 
that revenge might hold a few thrills in store for her; in a word, I 
maneuvered her into discharging over the thought of assassinating 
her mother. After that, we rose from bed. 

‘My friend,” I said to Sbrigani, “we have now but to lay 
hands on the victims; call in your men and have them clap the ladies 
in irons.” 

The grandmother is seized first and dragged down into the 
cellars of the chateau, where she is very shortly joined by the 
Countess. Understanding nothing of these untoward proceedings, 
she appears stunned by surprise. sAglaia is there. 

‘Monster!’ I say to Madame Donis, “‘justice cries out that 
you be made the victim of your own wickedness.” 

‘“‘What’s this? Perfidious wretch, was not this plot as much 
your handiwork as mine ?”” 

‘‘Ha, I put on a show of vice and so lured you into divulging 
your secret; but now, having you in my power, I have no further 
need to feign.” 

When night falls I have these two prisoners brought up to 
the salon Madame Donis had converted into the theater for her 
horrors. Aglaia, stiffened in her purpose, steeled to anything by 
my mingled scoldings and cajoleries, is amused by the spectacle; she 
is quite as unmelted by the plight in which she beholds her grand- 
mother as by the fate that has overtaken her mother. I had been 
clever enough to inform her in advance that the Countess had 
contrived her evil plans at the old lady’s instigation; and the 
tortures began. 

They followed the course Madame Donis had charted, ex- 
cept that instead of being the agent the hapless creature was the 
patient. Reclining, her daughter and I, in a large bathtub and 
frigging ourselves amain, upon us the blood of the two women 
poured, running from the thousand and one gashes inflicted by Sbri- 
gani. Here I should say in Aglaia’s honor that her courage and 
determination wavered not once; progressing swiftly from pleasure 


thus enriched her repertory by one pleasure the more. Any woman may do as much; 
all of them should: imitating Arsinoe, to the allurements of a first form of enjoyment 
they too will add the spice of a second. Every immorality leads ta another, and the 
more of them you associate to fucking, the happier you must necessarily become. 


654 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to ecstasy, her delirium held at a frenzied pitch to the end of the 
operation, and it was not brief. Sbrigani devised all sorts of in- 
genious expedients to lengthen the ordeal, and the accomplished 
fellow crowned it, rather as you might have guessed, by bum- 
stuffing the victims, who zave up the ghost under his belly. 

“And that,” said I, after congratulating my barbarous hus- 
band when he was done, “makes us the masters of the place; let us 
sack it and beat a rapid retreat. Aglaia,” I went on, “you presently 
grasp the object of my crime: as your mother’s friend I had only 
a share of her wealth, all of it is mine now. The fires you kindled 
in my heart burn there yet; you know Elise and Raimonde? I mean 
to include you in my troupe. But along with certain pleasures this 
includes certain services, ike the others you too shall be called upon 
to contribute to the commonwealth, you will have to lie, cheat, 
steal, seduce, commit every crime, as do we when our advantage 
enjoins it; to rallying to our colors the alternative is abandonment 
and poverty. Which shal] it be?” 

“Oh, my dear friend, I shall never quit your side,” the girl 
exclaimed, tears in her eyes; “‘it is not my situation that dictates 
my choice, it is not fear of hardship, but my heart, and my heart 
belongs entirely to you.” 

The heat still in him, my husband was not an impassive 
spectator to this moving scene; his feverish eyes and prick led me 
to suspect that he was bent on fucking, and his words shortly 
confirmed it. 

“God’s blood and balls!” he declared, “this dastardly thing 
I have done I heavily regret now, and nothing short of raping the 
daughter will make up for the loss of the mother I have killed; 
turn her over to me, Juliette.” 

And being rather t20 pressed to wait for my response, the 
libertine, his prick up solid and true, caught the lass and deflowered 
her at a stroke. Blood emanating from that youthful cunt has 
scarce stained those white thighs when the Italian withdraws, turns 
the seamy side up, gives three lusty heaves and lo! he’s implanted 
his device in her ass. 

“Juliette,” he inquired while he sawed away, “what’s to be 
done with this article now? A moment ago we could perhaps have 
found a buyer for her first fruits, but they have been picked and 


Juliette & 655 


there’s an end to the whore’s usefulness. It’s dull, I tell you, it 
lacks intrigue,” he continued, fucking apace, “it lacks character, 
Juliette, believe me; so let us reunite what Nature originally 
assembled and leave this family in peace; of the murder of this’ 
child something superb might be made—fuck my eyes, the mere 
thought causes me to discharge.” 

And here, my friends, I confess it to you, my native ferocity 
swept all other considerations aside, Sbrigani’s pathetic appeal had 
stirred me as the rascal knew it would, and a sudden spate of fuck 
rising in my cunt sealed Aglaia’s doom. 

“You are going to go the way of your kin,” I said to her; “the 
idea of putting you to death stiffens us, and we are of that repro- 
bate breed that has never bowed to any law but its passions.” 

Despite her shrill protests and entreaties she was delivered 
over to our valets, and while the rascals tupped her in the manners 
they fancied, Sbrigani toiled to brilliant effect over me. From 
pleasures our satellites soon turned to brutalities; grossly insulting 
the object they had latterly favored with their homages, they 
advanced in short order from expletives to threats, from threats 
to blows. And of succor Aglaia had none from me, nor comfort: 
she stretched her lovely arms imploringly toward me, wrung her 
pretty hands, called my name; I did not heed her. The luckless child 
seemed to remind me tacitly of our secret pleasures and to conjure 
me to hark again to the sentiment which guided me then. I was 
deaf. Incredibly aroused by Sbrigani who was embuggering me the 
whole while, I felt things other than compassion for the child; I 
became at once her accuser and her executioner. 

“Ply those whips,” I ordered my valets, “‘lash some blood 
from this little ass that so recently afforded me such delights.” 

She was lying flat upon a narrow bench, straps held her in 
position and her head, pulled up at a sharp angle and maintained 
there by an iron collar, offered itself to the kisses wherewith I 
covered her mouth as I presented my ass to Sbrigani who was 
sodomizing me while Madame Donis’ domestic flogged him. 
With each hand I frigged the prick of a valet; each of them, armed 
with a cat-o’-nine-tails, hacked at this or that part of our exciting 
victim’s body. At the height of this scene I loosed the second of two 
thundering discharges, and when at last I espied those charming 


656 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


buttocks in full bloom, so tattered and torn that for all those 
stripes and cuts nothing more was co be seen of the once satin- 
smooth skin, I had a chandelier taken down and Aglaia hanged by 
the hair from the ringbolt in the ceiling; then, opening her thighs 
wide and securing them thus by cords, I myself caught up a 
martinet and belabored the most delicate parts of her body, two- 
thirds of my blows landed inside her gaping cunt. I was beyond 
words entertained by the poor girl’s convulsive jerks, the more 
amusing for being performed in mid-air; it would now be a lurch 
backward to avoid the strokes I dealt her from before, now a for- 
ward lunge to avoid those I aimed at her behind; and not one of 
those acrobatics failed to cost her a handful of hair. And I was 
discharging myself nigh out of my mind when a truly delicious idea 
entered it; this idea was too much to Sbrigani’s taste not to be 
translated into action on the spot. We disinterred the cadavers of 
Aglaia’s two forebears, we buried them to the waist in two deep 
holes; facing them we placed the last of her line in a third hole, 
dug yet a little deeper, from which her head and shoulders emerged, 
and ’twas opposite that hideous sight we left her to perish slowly. 
A ball from a pistol rid us of the nursemaid and, laden with an 
immense booty, Sbrigani, our two menials, and I set out at once 
for the capital of the Papal States where we were greeted by our 
two girls who, with the rest of our movables, were awaiting us at 
the address we had given them earlier in Florence. 


As we made our entry into Rome, “Oh, Sbrigani!” I exclaimed, 
“‘here we are at last in this superb capital of the world! How in- 
structive it is to meditate upon the strange parallel that asks to be 
drawn between the Rome of ancient days and this other that is 
contemporary. With what astonishment, and with what scorn, I am 
going to see statues of Peter and Mary poised upon the altars of 
Bellona and of Venus. Few ideas so exalt my imagination. O you 
people besotted by religion, by it.laid low,” I mused as I scanned 
the features of these modern Romans, searching for some traits 
reminiscent of the grandeur and glory of those erstwhile masters of 
the world, ‘“‘to what a point has the most infamous, the most loath- 
some of religions succeeded in degrading you! What would a Cato 


» Juliette 2» 657 


say, or a Brutus, if he were to see a Julius, a Borgia parading his 
insolent pomp upon the august ashes one of those heroes confidently 
recommended to the respect of later generations and the awed ad- 
miration of the universe ?”’ 

Despite the oath I had taken to enter no church, I could not 
resist a desire to visit St. Peter’s. This monument, it cannot be 
denied, not only beggars description, it is far superior to anything 
the most fertile imagination could conceive. But that part of the 
human spirit is also afflicted, as one realizes the humiliating truth, 
in seeing that such great talents were exhausted, such colossal sums 
were expended, in honor of a religion so stupid, so ridiculous as the 
one we have had the misfortune to be born into. For magnificence 
the altar is quite beyond compare, isolated, set between four 
wreathed columns, mounting almost the full height of the church, 
and placed upon the very tomb of St. Peter, who for all that did not 
die in Rome nor indeed ever show his face there. 

“Oh, what a couch for embuggerment,” I declared to Sbrigani. 
“You shall see, my friend, just leave it to me and inside a month 
Juliette’s rectum will play host, upon this superb altar, to the 
modest prick of the Vicar of Christ.” 

And, my patient auditors, only wait a little and the sequel will 
show you whether my prediction was accurate. 

Coming to Rome it was my belief that I ought to establish my- 
self under altogether different colors here than those we had flown 
at Florence. Provided with several letters of recommendation I 
had obtained from the Grand Duke, and in which, as I had re- 
quested, he referred to me as a countess,.and having the means to 
back such a title, I took a house of the sort that would silence any 
discussion of the legitimacy of my pretensions. My first care was 
to place my funds in investment. The enormous theft operated at 
Minski’s retreat, the other lately achieved at Prato, the half a 
million francs Madame Donis’ Fontange was not destined to see, 
my Florentine earnings, all this added to what I had amassed in 
the course of my tour through north Italy made up a capital yield- 
ing eight hundred thousand livres a year; an income of suffhcient 
size, you observe, to permit me a house rivaling anything maintained 
by the most brilliant princes in the entire land. Elise and Raimonde 
were my ladies in waiting, and Sbrigani thought it would better 


658 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


promote my interests if he were no longer to pass as my husband, 
but as my gentleman squire henceforth. 

I went to pay my calls in a perfectly regal carriage. Among 
my introductions was a letter to His Eminence, Cardinal de Bernis, 
our ambassador to the Holy See, who received me with all the 
gallantry to be expected from that charming emulator of Petrarch. 

My next stop was at the palace of the beautiful Princess 
Borghese, a very libertine woman whom you shall soon see taking 
a leading role in my adventures. 

Two days later I presented myself at Cardinal Albani’s resi- 
dence: Albani, the greatest debauchee in the Sacred College, and 
who that same afternoon must absolutely summon his painter and 
have him do a portrait of me in the nude, for inclusion in his 
gallery. 

After that it was Duchess Grillo, a delightful woman gone 
preposterously to waste ipon the gloomiest of husbands, and over 
whom I went fairly wild at first sight. My special acquaintances 
ended there, and it is in this charming circle you are about to behold 
me revive all the turbulent exploits of my youth—yes, good friends, 
yes, of my youth, I may employ the term since I was then starting 
my twenty-fifth year. I had not as yet to complain of Nature, how- 
ever; she had deteriorated none of my features, to the contrary, 
she had given them that look of ripeness and that definition which 
are regularly absent in girlhood, and I may say in all truthfulness 
that if I had been considered pretty hitherto, I could now assert 
claims to the extremest beauty. My waist had lost nothing of its 
slenderness, my breasts, still fresh, round, firm, had held up 
miraculously. Exuberantly poised and of an agreeable fairness, my 
buttocks showed not a sign of the rough and lewd usage I had time 
and again exposed them to, the hole between them was a trifle 
large, to be sure, but of a fine reddish-brown hue, hairless, and 
wheneyer displayed certain to attract tongues; my cunt too had lost 
much of its narrowness, tut with the aid of coquetry, ointments, and 
craft, I could at will make all that sparkle as brightly as any 
virgin’s new penny. Regarding my temperament, it had acquired 
strength over the years, and was now something truly terrifying 
and always under the control of my mind: when got properly 
started, it was absolutely indefatigable. But for the purpose of 


Juliette & 659 


setting it surely into motion I was coming to rely upon wine and 
spirits; my brain once spinning, I was capable of anything; I also 
employed opium and other love-stimulants Durand had prescribed 
and which were on open and profuse sale in Italy. You ought never 
to fear irritating your lascivious appetites by such means, art is 
always more helpful than Nature, and the one disadvantage to 
trying a “rug is the obligation you fall under to continue taking it 
for the rest of your life. 

The beginning of my stay at Rome was distinguished by the 
conquest of two women. One was Princess Borghese. Not two days 
passed before she let me read in her eyes all her desire that we 
become intimately acquainted. She was thirty years of age, vi- 
vacious, engaging, witty, and profligate; pretty was her figure, 
magnificent her hair, bright were her eyes, she had imagination, a 
prepossessing manner. 

Next, Duchess Grillo: less forward, younger, better behaved, 
and lovelier, her bearing was a queen’s, she was modest, of seemly 
reserve, was not so energetic as the Princess and quite lacked her 
imagination, but was incomparably more kindly than she, more 
virtuous, more sensitive. Equally taken by these two women, it goes 
without saying, after the brief sketches I have given of them, that 
whilst the one had a stimulating influence upon my mind, the other 
won her way immediately into my heart. 

A week after our initial meeting the Princess invited me to 
supper at her little property just outside the city. 

“We shall be alone,” she told me; “everything about you 
intrigues me, my dear Countess, and I am determined to make the 
most of this promising discovery.” 

You will readily understand that after such advances it was 
not long before all ceremony was abolished between us. The 
weather was sultry. Following an abundant and voluptuous repast 
served by five charming girls in a garden where the scent of roses 
and jasmine combined with the sweet murmur and coolness of 
plashing fountains, the Princess drew me off to a lonely summer- 
house lost in a glade of sheltering poplars. We entered a circular 
room, around whose wall, which was entirely sheathed by mirrors, 
ran a long sofa standing but six or eight inches off a floor every- 
where strewn with pillows and cushions; here, in a word, was one 


660 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of the prettiest temples Venus had in all Italy. We were escorted 
there by the young serving girls who left us to ourselves after 
lighting several lamps in which perfumed oil shed a soft glow 
behind shades of green gauze. 

‘“‘My treasure,” suggested the Princess, “‘let us henceforward 
address each other by our first names; I abhor everything that re- 
minds me of wedlock. So call me Olympia; and I may call you 
Juliette, yes, my angel? You will permit it?” 

And the most ardent kiss was bestowed lingeringly upon my 
lips. 
“Dear Olympia,” said I, folding this bewitching creature in 
my arms, ‘‘what would I not permit you? When she adorned you 
with so many charms did not Nature accord you rights to every 
heart, and must you not necessarily seduce all those upon whom 
you bend your burning gaze ?” 

“You are divine, my darling Juliette, kiss me a thousand times 
over,” said Olympia, sinking upon the sofa. “Oh, my sweetest 
friend, I feel it for a certainty, yes, of nothing have I ever been so 
sure, we are going to do many and wonderful things together. . 
But I must tell you the truth about myself, the whole truth— 
oh, I tremble. ... ’Tis :hat I am such a libertine; no, no, dear soul, 
you must not misunderstand me. I adore you—but it isn’t love for 
you that inflames me now: when possessed by lust I become immune 
to love, forget it completely, and it is only lewdness I recognize.” 

“O heaven!” I cried, “‘is it possible that in two places a full 
five hundred leagues apart, Nature created two so identical souls?” 

‘What, Juliette!” was Olympia’s rapid response, “you are 
libertine too? If *twere so we could pollute without loving each 
other, we could discharge like a pair of sows, immodestly, indeli- 
cately, we could include others in our riotings—ah, let me devour 
you, my chit, my dove, let me kiss you to death; credit satiety for 
all that, credit habit, credit our lavish style of living, our leisure 
and opulence : accustomed to denying ourselves nothing, everything 
now palls on us, and fools have no conception of whither one may 
be led by this surfeit and this apathy.” 

As she chatted Olympia was undressing me, undressing her- 
self, and no sooner were we both naked than we came to grips. 
Borghese’s first gestures were to catch my knees, to separate my 


Juliette -» 661 


thighs, to run her hands caressingly over my buttocks, between 
them, and to dart her tongue as far into my cunt as it could reach. 
Besotted by pleasure, I was easy game for the tribade; she is 
shortly quaffiing off mouthfuls of my fuck, I spring into action, roll 
her onto the cushions strewn about that boudoir, and sprawl upon 
her: while, my head wedged between her legs, I cunt-suck her with 
all my might, the rascal, her head between my legs also, renders 
me the same service: thus do we discharge six or seven times. 

“We are too few,” Olympia points out to me. “Unaided, two 
women cannot hope to satisfy each other; we had better have my 
menials in, they are pretty, the eldest is under seventeen, the 
youngest fourteen. But they are capable. Not a day passes but 
each dips her fingers in my cunt; shall I summon them?” 

“Don’t hesitate to do so on my account, I am as fond of all 
that as you; I applaud any contribution to libertinage, anything 
that increases it is precious to my senses.” 

- “And nothing that stirs them ought to be neglected, they can- 
not be subjected to effects too numerous nor too strong,’ Olympia 
rejoined ; ‘‘ah, those shy or skittish women, the wretched creatures,” 
she went on, ‘“‘who, experiencing no pleasure save it be inside the 
bounds of love and legitimacy, idiotically fancy that where there 
is no adoration there can be no fucking.” 

But a moment after the Princess rang for them, the five girls, 
too well trained to require instructions and who had doubtless been 
waiting nearby in expectation of the call, marched in, nude. All 
had lovely faces, supple, shapely bodies, and when they gathered 
round Olympia, which is what they did at once, it seemed to me 
these were the Graces frolicking about Venus. 

“Juliette,” the Princess said to me, “I shall sit opposite you, 
these five girls will turn their coordinated and knowing attentions 
upon you and by means of the most amorous titillations, the most 
lascivious postures, they'll bring your fuck forth, I am confident 
of it; I shall watch you discharge, I ask no more. You have no 
idea the pleasure it gives me to see a beautiful woman lose her 
head to joy: I shall frig myself in the meantime, I shall let my 
mind rove and you may be sure it will wander far.” 

To this proposition my lubricity could raise no objection, I 
therefore signified my assent. Olympia distributed orders: one of 


662 ed THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


these girls, squatting over me, offered me a pretty little cunt to suck; 
I myself lying upon the padded straps of a bed which was at the 
same time a kind of aerial swing, my buttocks were posed above 
the face of a second gir. whose task was to lick my asshole, a third, 
stretched upon me, sucked my cunt, and I frigged the remaining 
two, one with either hand; observing this spectacle, Olympia, who 
was staring avidly, held in one hand a silken cord which led to the 
car wherein I was suspended, and by means of gentle tugs she got 
it to swaying, this mo:ion prolonging, multiplying the tonguings 
I was giving and receiving, and heightening their voluptuousness to 
an unbelievable point. For pleasure, never before, I do believe, 
had I experienced the like of it. Thereupon—and now Olympia 
achieved the impossible the undreamt of : she contrived to improve 
the already perfect—thereupon, I say, coming from I could not tell 
where, the sounds of delightful music reached my ears. As though 
the exotic fables of the Koran were suddenly come true, I thought 
I had been transported into Islam’s paradise and there surrounded 
by the houris the propret promises the faithful, it seemed to me 
their intention in caressing me was to drive me mad amongst the 
uttermost excesses of lubricity. Olympia was causing the swing to 
sway in cadence with tke music; I was gone quite out of my mind, 
between me and real existence all ties had been dissolved save that 
last one maintained by the profound throbbings of my joy. My 
ecstasy lasted an hour; then Olympia climbed into the swing. 
Deliciously inspired by zhe music, I polluted my hostess for another 
hour and a quarter in her voluptuous machine; after that, following 
a short interval of repose, we resumed our pleasures and varied 
their form. 

She and I lying upon the heaps of cushions carpeting the floor, 
we placed the pretties: of the girls between us. She frigged us 
both manually; two other girls, established between our thighs, 
cunt-sucked us; and the remaining two, straddling our chests, gave 
us their cunts to suck. “Thus were we occupied for nearly an hour; 
next, the girls rotated «heir posts. We cunt-sucked those who had 
just been cunt-sucking us, and those who had just been cunt-sucked 
by us in turn sucked our cunts; and the music played on. Olympia 
finally asked me, would I care to have the musicians join us? 

“Yes, call them in,” I said, and declared that I would like to 


Juliette 663 


have the entire world standing there, seeing me in this state of 
inordinate happiness. 

“Oh, my cherub, my heavenly crcarines, caroled Olympia, 
sprinkling passionate kisses upon my mouth, “you are an arrant, 
shameless.little whore, I adore you for it. That is just what every 
woman should be, that is what all of them are save the fools 
amongst them, and fools they are who do not sacrifice everything 
to their pleasures; fools? in what terms describe the stupidity of 
those who can worship any god but Venus? who can observe any 
rule apart from that of prostituting themselves to individuals of 
all sexes, all ages, all sorts and conditions? Oh, Juliette, the most 
sacred of the laws writ in my heart is whorishness; the purpose of 
my life is to shed fuck, shedding it is my primary need and sole 
pleasure: I should like to be a prostitute, but a cheap one. 

“To be a whore—the thought burns in my brain and sets a 
fever racing through my blood. I want to be hired to the most 
exacting libertines, I want to be obliged to employ a thousand wiles 
and artifices to rouse the most lethargic rakes, and to satisfy the 
least easy to please; I want to be their toy, their butt, their victim, 
let them do with me what they will, I'd gladly endure anything, 
everything—even tortures. 

‘Juliette, shall we be whores? Let us, my dearest, let’s go 
awhoring, let’s sell ourselves, let’s get ourselves to a gutter and 
open grinning cunts to whole passing nations, our cunts, our 
mouths, our assholes, let’s ope all our holes to every filthy stopper, 
Ah, fuck my eyes, girl, my head is beginning to reel; like the fiery 
charger, I thrust heaving flank to meet gashing spur; I am flying 
to my undoing, I know it, I know it well, it is inevitable . . . and 
I do not care. Bah, I am almost vexed by this credit and the titles 
that are mine and which, favoring my misconduct, also deny it 
notoriety—I would that all the earth be privy to the things I do, 
I would that they drag me like the lowliest of wretches to the 
fate their abandon designs them to. . . . Do you fancy I dread 
that fate? No, whatever it may be, I'd rush thither unafraid. . 
The stocks, the pillory, the scaffold itself would for me be a 
privilege, the throne of delight, upon it I’d cry death defiance, 
and discharge in the pleasure of perishing the victim of my crimes 
and over the idea that in future my name would be a byword for 


664 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


evil, at whose mere mention generations of men would tremble. 
Such is the pass I have come to, Juliette, this is where libertinage 
has brought me, this is where I wish to live my life and die, I vow 
it to you; were I less fond of you I would be unable to declare 
these things to you. You would hear more? Know then that I feel 
I am on the eve of casting myself headlong into frightful de- 
bauchery: at this very moment the last inhibiting prejudices wither 
away before my eyes, the remaining restraints dissolve: I decide 
to perpetrate the blackest crimes, my mind is made up—and the 
scales drop from my eyes: I see the abyss yawning at my feet, and 
jubilantly I hurl myself over the brink. I spit contemptuously upon 
that illusory honor whose having costs so many women their felicity, 
which they trade away in exchange for no recompense at all. Honor 
exists where? in opinion; but the single opinion that matters, that 
which alone confers happiness, is one’s own, and not others’. Be 
wise enough to scorn the opinion of the public, which depends not 
upon us, have the intelligence to annihilate the stupid sentiment of 
honor which only leads us to happiness by way of privations, 
do this, I say, and you will very quickly discover that it is possible 
to live quite as comfortably, quite as contentedly, once become the 
object of universal opprobrium as when crowned by the sorry 
diadem of fair fame. O my companions in libertinage and crime, 
join me in mocking at this empty honor as we do at all other vile 
superstitions: a piece of moral licentiousness or the most ordinary 
physical fucking is worth a million times more than all the false 
pleasures honor accords. Ah, you shall someday realize, after 
my own example, how voluptuous delights are ameliorated once 
this phantom ts exploded, and like me you will improve your 
enjoyments the more thoroughly you despise it.” 

“Adorable creature,” I answered Olympia, lovely to behold 
as she delivered her impassioned speech, “endowed with such a 
mind ... and with such aptitudes as you have shown me, you should 
someday go far; I seem to find, nevertheless, that you have yet 
some important ground to cover. You may perhaps accept all the 
aberrations of lubricity, but I do not believe you are acquainted 
with, or indeed have even dreamed of, all those which may derive 
from lubricity. Although several years younger than you, owing 
to the infinitely wilder career I have pursued I may have the 


Juliette & 665 


advantage in experience. No, no, my dear Olympia, you have 
still to learn whither crimes of lust may lead; you are, I wager, 
still unprepared to accept the horrors these misdeeds may in- 
volve—” 

“Horrors,” Borghese interrupted, the color mounting into 
her cheeks, ‘‘ah! I venture to afirm I am not in arrears upon an 
article which you appear to esteem so essential. I would have you 
know that I poisoned my first husband, the same fate awaits the 
second.” 

“Delicious woman,” I murmured, hugging Olympia in my 
arms, ‘‘forgive me if I seemed to entertain doubts of your char- 
acter; but, blessed friend, that crime you committed, this other 
you project, they are motivated crimes, in all likelihood justifiable, 
at any rate necessary; whereas those crimes I would require of 
you would be gratuitous. Eh! is not crime in itself delicious enough 
to be committed for no practical purpose? Must we have an excuse 
for committing it? A pretext? And the tart flavor crime secretes, 
is that not alone sufficient to quicken our passions? My angel, of 
all the sensations in the world I do not want there to be one you 
have not tasted; with such a brain as yours, you would be grief- 
stricken to find that some sort of pleasure exists which you had 
not procured yourself. Be persuaded there is nothing to do under 
the sun that has not been done already, nothing that is not done 
every day, and, above all else, nothing that can conflict with the 
laws of a Nature who never incites us to evil save when she has 
need that we doit.” 

“Explain yourself, Juliette,” asked Olympia, considerably 
moved by my remarks. 

“Surely,” I replied. “Tell me: what were the principal feelings 
in your soul as you set about ridding yourself of that first husband 
of yours?” 

“The thirst for revenge; disgust, hate . . . and restlessness, a 
consuming desire to break my chains, to gain my freedom.” 

‘‘And the part played by lust *” 

“By lust?” 

“It was silent in you?” 

“Why, I did not consult it, it did not speak—” 

“Well, if in days to come you should commit similar crimes, 


666 « THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


do not neglect to interrogate it as you perform. Let lust provide 
the spark to the tinderbox of crime; combine the one passion with 
the other, and you shall be staggered by the results.” 

“Oh, Juliette,” the Princess whispered, gazing at me with 
widestarted eyes and as though electrified by my suggestion, “the 
ideas you put in my head. . . . Ah, I was but a child, little did I 
know, less yet did I make of my opportunity—I realize it now.” 

I then represented :o Madame Borghese all that a libertine 
spirit may extract from blending cruelty and lewdness, and de- 
veloped for her, upon this great subject, all the theories you are 
so familiar with, my friends, and which you so superlatively put 
into practice. She had no trouble following my arguments and so 
rightly grasped the conclusions that it was with a reeling brain 
the rascal swore to me we would not take leave of each other 
before having jointly perpetrated a few of these voluptuous 
abominations. 

“Oh, my love,” she said, and she was completely afire, “a 
thousand things astir inside me are telling me how heavenly it 
‘must be to rob one of our fellow creatures of the treasure of his 
existence, the most precious in a human being’s possession. To 
sever, to shatter the ties attaching that person to life, and this 
solely with a view to procuring oneself a pleasant sensation, for 
the sole purpose of discharging a little more agreeably . . . oh yes! 
this shock delivered to the nervous system, resulting from the effect 
of pain undergone by others, oh yes, it makes perfect sense to me, 
Juliette, and I have no doubt at all that the joy engendered by this 
concatenation of phenomena must culminate in the very ecstasy 
of the gods.” 

It was then, while she was in a very lather of agitation, that 
the musicians appeared. 

Ten youths aged from sixteen to twenty composed the band 
which now filed in; and they were incomparably pretty lads, 
swathed in filmy, transparent tunics draped in the Greek manner. 

“These are the art'sts who have provided the concert,’’ the 
lewd creature said to me as she had them step up one by one; “‘first 
witness the pleasures I am going to taste with them, and afterward 
imitate me if you care to.” 

Whereupon the two youngest of those winsome boys posted 


Juliette & 667. 


themselves, one by Olympia’s head, as she lay still sprawled upon — 
the pillows, the other hard by her bush. The remaining eight split | 
into two groups, four of them gathering behind the boy at Olympia’s - 
head, four gathering behind the boy stationed near her pudendum; | 
each of the two closest to her frigged his four companions’ mem- 
bers, he at her head tendered Olympia for sucking the four devices 
he was stroking and then when they spouted guided the spout so 
that it splashed upon her face. In the meantime, the one placed 
by her cunt turn by turn plunged into it and snapped out again the 
four youthful pricks in his care, and saw to it that their exhalations 
landed upon her clitoris; and thanks to these proceedings Olympia 
was very soon covered with fuck from groin to brow. Lost in a 
labyrinth of delicious transports, never a word did she utter but 
only a few sighs, a few ecstatic moans, and all her body rippled with 
exquisite quiverings. Once all the pricks are frigged empty, the two 
masturbators leap lightly upon her, one takes her in his arms, 
encunts her, exposes Olympia’s superb ass to his cohort, who 
deftly parts her buttocks and sodomizes her; while Olympia fucks, 
the other pricks slip one after the other into her mouth again, 
she resucks them, repumps them in turn, and finally, quite unhinged 
and shrieking, discharges like a maenad. 

“So then,” said she, rising to her feet and standing trium- 
phantly in a puddle of sperm, ‘‘are you satisfied with me?” 

“Indeed,” I replied, I too soiled and drunk from the pleasure 
the Princess’ five serving girls had been affording me while I 
watched her performance, ‘indeed, my dear, you have done toler- 
ably well, but better yet may be done, as I intend to show you now.” 

So saying I turn to the girls and appoint them to the chore 
of reviving the musicians’ members. Once all ten are suitably erect, 
I take them in hand. They were supple, agile, responsive to the 
touch; I plant two of them in my cunt, another in my ass, I mouth 
one, two nestle under my armpits, one in my hair, I frig a pair, the 
tenth rubs against my eyes; but I forbid any discharging. There 
must, I explain, be ten permutations, each must successively visit 
all the shrines I make available to their homage, only then may 
there be any outpouring of libations. Dreadfully excited by the 
preludes, those ten fair youths positively drowned me in fuck, and 
Madame Borghese, who had been observing me while enduring 


668 > THE MARQU:S DE SADE 


intense frigging from her five girls, allowed that my method of 
proceeding was more skillful than hers. 

‘“‘And now,” said I, ‘‘we must think of these five nimble- 
fingered fricatrices here; they deserve a reward.” 

Disposing them in various and voluptuous positions, upon the 
body of each we applied a brace of young fuckers. Contrary to all 
principles, we clapped the grosser pricks into asses, into cunts the 
smaller were stowed; we moved from group to group, proffering 
advice and encouragements. Olympia’s delight was to snatch a 
prick out from wherever it happened to be buried, to suck it a while, 
and to restore it to place again; and sometimes when she came 
upon a vacant orifice, whether cunt or ass, she would thrust her 
tongue into it and spend a quarter of an hour licking and sucking 
away. And whenever shie evicted a fucker, while she tongued his 
partner she would receive a fucking from him. More marked in 
my attentions than she, it was by means of smart slaps upon the 
buttocks and occasional] kicks that I cheered on the combatants, 
or else I'd squeeze a testicle here, twiddle a clitoris there, or jab 
my thumb into an anus while whispering smutty instructions in 
an ear and biting it next. In fine, I omitted nothing apt to expedite 
the emission of fuck, and my interventions usually brought it forth 
in gushes. But those discharges occurred in my ass; for I would 
not for the world have let those sluts reap the fruit of my labors, 
certainly not, I never do anything save it be for my personal 
advantage and if the things I do are done well, that, my friends, 
is the reason why. 

This scene concluded, I proposed another. Here, we would 
each sprawl flat upon one of the girls, our cunt covering her mouth, 
she would suck it while: we sucked the cunt of another girl just 
ahead of us and presented our asses to the ten youths who, served 
by the remaining girl of the five, would embugger us now the one, 
now the other. All this was acceptable to Olympia, save that where 
she was concerned—and her amendment attested to a greater 
degree of libertinage than I would have given her credit for— 
she preferred to kiss an ass rather than a cunt; and the whore, 
of her own accord, without any prompting from me, but thereby 
demonstrating a perfect sympathy with my ideas, bit that ass 
fiercely enough to draw blood. Seeing this, I felt completely at my 


Juliette 669 


ease, and catching hold of the breasts belonging to her whose cunt 
I was lapping, I wrung and wrestled with them in a way that won 
a sudden shrill scream from her. That was the moment Olympia 
discharged. 

“I’ve caught you, you rascal,” I said to her, ‘“‘you are begin- 
ning to detect pleasure in the commotion created by pain inflicted 
upon others. It is a favorable sign: we ought soon to be moving 
on to better things.” 

After having been embuggered ten times in succession we 
swung our cunts around to the adversary. A girl squatting above 
our foreheads simultaneously gave us her cunt and her bum to kiss; 
with both hands a second massaged our clitoris and asshole; in 
the meantime we were encunted; we discharged . . . we wallowed in 
a sea of delights. Oral pleasures came next; we sucked all those 
lads, we got them all to discharge into our mouths; and while this 
was going forward each of us was having her clitoris sucked by 
one girl, her asshole pumped by another. Exhausted, Olympia sug- 
gested that we restore our forces; we repaired to a gorgeously 
lighted, luxuriously furnished dining room. A superb collation was 
awaiting us in a huge basket of flowers, this basket lay nested in 
the boughs of an orange tree laden with fruit; when I reached for 
an orange I discovered it was of ice. Such surprises were held in 
all the rest, everything showed the mark of the most refined taste 
and the most elegant sumptuousness. We were served by the girls; 
from where they were concealed behind a decoration the youths 
charmed us now by the sounds of their melodious instruments. 

Intoxicated after our feats of lubricity, Olympia and I were 
shortly drunk from wines and liqueurs also. 

“Now then,” I asked of my companion, whose head was 
reeling like mine, ‘what would you say to ending with an infamy ?” 

“Simply name it, I am ready for anything.” 

“Let us immolate one of these girls.” 

“This one,” Olympia answered, catching the prettiest of the 
five by the wrist. 

“Gracious! You consent?” 

“Why, of course. For what reason should I refrain from 
imitating you? Do you think I am to be daunted at the prospect of 
a murder? Ha, you shall see whether I am fit to be your pupil.” 


670 %& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And, our victim in tow, we returned to the circular room 
where our orgies had taken place. All servants are dismissed, all 
doors barred, we three are alone. 

“How shall we torment the jade?” I wanted to know. “Instru- 
ments seem to be lacking here.” 

While speaking I was examining the body of that truly superb 
young thing; I studied it by the light of two candles which ever 
and anon I would snuff out upon her buttocks, upon her thighs, 
upon her breasts. Olympia picked up a candlestick too; thus did 
we amuse ourselves for the space of an hour or so. After burning 
her we pinched her, tweezed her, prodded her, and clawed her a 
little with our fingernails. Both of us completely tipsy, without 
quite realizing what we were doing or saying, we vomited, belched, 
farted, and pissed—all that confusedly—and we tortured our 
victim amain. The wretched creature screamed away, but neither 
her cries nor our wild laughter were heard by any living soul, the 
precautions having been well made against it. My suggestion was 
that we hang the girl by the breasts and stab her to a slow death 
with hairpins. Olympia. whose progress was keeping pace with 
her lessons, agreed to everything. The unlucky girl’s agonies 
extended over another two hours during which we drank ourselves 
into a further stupor or rum and her tears. Next, my companion 
and I, both spent after the fatigues of lust and of cruelties, numb 
from our intemperances, sank upon the cushions underfoot and 
slept for five hours, the victim dangling between us. The sun was 
already well up in the sky when we awoke; I helped Olympia bury 
the corpse beneath some bushes, and as I took my leave of her we 
both declared our earnest wish to pursue a collaboration which had 
begun so auspiciously. 

Having neglected to tell Sbrigani I would be away overnight 
in the country, he and my women had been troubled by my absence 
and great was their relief to see me return; I assured them I was 
well but weary, and went straight to my bed. The following day 
Sbrigani, who thought of nothing but money, asked what profit 
I supposed might be gleaned from this intrigue. 

“It has already been worth a host of pleasures,” I sighed. 

“It could be worth better still,” replied my serious-minded 
gentleman squire. “I have glanced into the matter; my informants 


Juliette 2 671 


tell me Borghese is the Pope’s familiar. We must have her intro- 
duce you to the Holy Father, we must prepare ourselves access to 
the Church treasures, we must drive out of Rome with an additional 
seven or eight millions in our baggage. You know, Juliette, I am 
wondering whether it was not a mistake to have adopted such an 
aristocratic style here, I fear lest it disserve our aims.” 

“Not at all,” I assured Sbrigani; ‘“‘the lofty tone, a dazzling 
panoply, and these titles are so many supplementary means to 
excite lewd covetings; their ambition will be flattered to have 
dealings with a woman of quality, | shall be able to triple my fees.” 

“Ah,” Sbrigani rejoined, ‘‘’tis not a few hundred thousand 
francs more or less that is at stake here. I have my eyes on higher 
objectives: Pius VI possesses tremendous riches. We must steal 
some of them.” 

“To do so, entry into his apartments must be gained, and is 
there any way to achieve this unless I be summoned there upon 
some libertine mission ?”” 

“Certainly not; but instead of waiting idly for an opportunity 
we must take the initiative, we must create the occasion as soon 
as we can, we must get into the Vatican and fleece that beggar.” 

As we were in the midst of this conversation a page in the 
service of Cardinal de Bernis brought me a message from his 
master. It was an invitation to supper at Villa Albani, several 
hours’ ride from Rome, and the prelate of that same name was, 
with Bernis, expecting me in his charming retreat. 

“Juliette,” Sbrigani exhorted me, ‘‘make the most of your 
outing : bear it ever in mind that larcenies, fraud, imposture, those 
are the sole aims of our travels; to enrich ourselves, there’s our 
sole purpose, that’s our duty, and if we failed of it ’twould be 
unpardonable. To it all pleasures are secondary and likely to entice 
you into detours; the only road we must follow is the great highway 
that leads to fortune.” 

Though no less ambitious than Sbrigani, quite as greedy for 
gold as he, my views concerning motives were not entirely similar 
to his. With me the proclivity for crime was the primary and com- 
pelling thing, and if I longed to steal it was far more for the sake 
of the pleasure which the act itself procured me than for lavishing 
money upon delights. 


672 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE. 


I arrived at the rendezvous decked out in all that art could 
add to the charms Nature had conferred upon me; my appearance, 
permit me to say, was lcvely in the extreme. 

Rather than interrupt my story, let me refrain from describing 
that enchanting campagna which attracts visitors from all over 
Europe. Those antiquit'es, perhaps the most precious relics that 
survive of classical Rome, those terraced gardens, the most ex- 
quisite, the best laid out, and best maintained in Italy—I should 
like to talk to you about them at length; but more eager to relate 
facts than to trace details, I shall move directly on to events, 
confident that you will not be displeased by my narrative, even 
unadorned. 

Walking into Cardinal Albani’s summer residence, great was 
my surprise to find Prinzess Borghese present there. By a window 
she and Bernis stood engaged in conversation; they broke it off 
upon seeing me enter, and came up to me. 

‘‘What a heavenly creature,” Olympia declared. ‘‘Cardinal,” 
she went on, addressing the aged Albani who had been staring 
fixedly at me ever since I descended from my carriage, “are you 
not of the opinion that we have no more beautiful woman in 
Rome?” 

Both prelates affirraed that they believed this to be the case. 

And we quit the drawing room. 

The Italians customarily place their living quarters in the 
uppermost stories of their houses; at this distance above the ground, 
they rightly suppose, the air is necessarily purer, less heavy, and 
in better circulation. Those upper apartments of the Villa Albani 
were beyond words eleyant; gauze curtains admitted the breeze 
while keeping out insects which might trouble the voluptuous 
projects for which it was very plain to me, as I glanced about, 
that the stage had been elaborately set. 

The moment we were installed, Olympia approached me and 
spoke in this strain. “Juliette, you were recommended to these two 
cardinals in attestations from the Duke of Tuscany similar to the 
letter you brought me from that prince, my ecclesiastical friends 
have been exceedingly eager to become acquainted with you... 
with your person, with your behavior, with your attitudes of mind. 
My relations with these gentlemen being of the closest and most 


Julictte & 673 


cordial sort, and knowing them quite as thoroughly and in the 
same way we, you and I, know each other, I have felt under no 
obligation to hide any of the truth from their curiosity: gratifying 
it, my accounts have, I believe, prepared a warm welcome for you. 
They desire you; I entreat you to accept their advances: these two 
dignitaries enjoy enormous favor with the Pope. ’Tis through 
their mediation preferments, advancements, graces of every variety 
are to be had; nay, nothing can be obtained in Rome save through 
them. However easy your circumstances, seven or eight thousand 
sequins now and then can do you no harm: one may often enough 
command the means to pay the butcher and the baker, but never 
has one too much to spend upon one’s frivolities, and especially 
when they are of the order of those we are addicted to. I offer you 
my own example, many a time have I received money from them, I 
still do. Ah, women are made to be fucked, made also to be sup- 
ported, and just as we should never turn up our noses at gifts, 
neither should we shun occasions for entitling ourselves to rewards. 
Bernis and his colleague, moreover, have in common a peculiar 
eccentricity, that of enjoying no pleasure unless it is paid for; I am 
certain you will appreciate this singularity. As well, I urge you to 
manifest the extremest indulgence toward them, nothing short of 
that is required with such libertines; only by dint of great art and 
complicated ministrations may their desires be reanimated; reserve 
would be misplaced here, make free, unrestrictedly, with every- 
thing; I shall show you how it is done; they must be relieved of 
their fuck, cost what it may, we can neglect nothing to achieve 
that end. All your wits and parts may therefore be put heavily to 
contribution; I felt you should be forewarned.” 

This speech would have surprised me less had I been more 
familiar with Roman manners. At any rate, if I was a little startled, 
I was by no means affrighted, not after the thousand and one trials 
I had faced intrepidly and come victoriously through in the past. 
Bernis, seeing that the Princess was done speaking her prologue, 
came forth now and addressed me in his turn. 

‘‘We know that you are charming,” said he, ‘intelligent and 
untainted by prejudices: Leopold’s written testimonial is very 
complete, it is upheld by the report we have had from Olympia, 
who was not reticent either. Upon the basis of this information

we allow ourselves to presume, Albani and I, that you'll not play 
the prude with us, and to demonstrate your good will we would 
have you show yourself as much a rascal as in actual fact you are, 
because a woman is only truly amiable, I believe one may say, 
to the extent she is a whore. And so you will surely concur in our 
view that she must be foolish indeed if when Nature gives her a 
taste for pleasures, she does not seek as many admirers for her 
charms as she may contrive to encounter men on earth.” 

“Gifted singer of the Vaucluse,” I replied, indicating to him 
that I was acquainted with his charming poetry, “you who penned 
your attack upon libertinage with such energy and ingenuity that 
the reader of your lines comes away worshiping what you condemn,‘ 
one would need many more virtues than I can claim in order to 
resist a man of your breed.” 

And squeezing his hand affectionately, “‘Ah, believe me,” 
I told him, “I am yours for life, and be equally certain that you 
will always find in me a student worthy of the great teacher who 
so generously deigns to undertake her.” 

The conversation became general and was soon enlivened by 
philosophy. Albani showed us a letter from Bologna, in which he 
was advised of the death of one of his intimates who, though 
occupying a position of foremost importance in the Church, having 
always lived in libertinage, had held out against conversion, even 
on his deathbed. 

“You knew the fellow,” said he to Bernis, “‘preaching had no 
effect upon him whatever: keeping his head and his wits up until 
the very end, he breathed his last while in the arms of that niece 
he adored, declaring to her that the one thing he regretted in the 
necessity of denying the existence of heaven was that it barred him 
from the hope of being someday reunited to her.” 

“It seems to me,” said Cardinal de Bernis, ‘‘that these deaths 
are beginning to become rather frequent: the author of Alzire and 
D’Alembert have made them fashionable.” 

“Assuredly,” Albani went on, “it is a sign of grave weakness 
to change one’s mind as one dies. Have we not time enough to 
come to a few conclusions during the course of a long life? Our

vigorous and lucid years should be employed choosing this or that 
belief, according to it should we live out our span and in it finally 
die. Still to be perplexed, to be in the grips of uncertainty as we 
enter our decline is to be heading for a frightful death. You will 
perhaps maintain that, deranging the organism, the ultimate crisis 
also unsteadies one’s doctrines. Yes, if these doctrines be either 
newly or timidly embraced, never when they are early adopted 
and determinedly adhered to, when they are the fruit of labor, 
of study, of deep meditation, because as such they form a habit and 
we carry our habits with us to the grave.” 

“Precisely,” said I, glad to have the opportunity of making 
my way of thinking known to the celebrated libertines in whose 
company I was, “and if the happy stoicism, which is my creed as 
it is yours, deprives us of some pleasures, it spares us a good many 
pains in life and instructs us in how suitably to die. I know not 
whether it is because I am but twenty-five,” I continued, ‘‘and 
therefore prone to behold as far off the moment when I shall be 
restored to the dust whereof I was made, or whether I derive my 
comfort and courage from my principles, but it is without the 
least terror that I contemplate the inevitable disjunction of the 
molecules now grouped into my existence. Quite convinced that I 
shall be no worse off after my life than I was before being born, 
I expect I shall surrender my body to the earth just as calmly, just 
as impassively as when out of the earth I received it.” 

“And what lies at the source of this tranquillity ? The profound 
contempt you have always had for religious nonsense,” Bernis 
declared; ‘‘had you relapsed but once, that would probably have 
sufficed to undo you forever. Whence the rule: one cannot become 
an unbeliever too early.” 

“But is that so easy as one may think?’ Olympia wondered. 

“It is far less difficult than some suppose,” Albani replied; 
“but you must cut the tree at the root. If you confine yourself to 
lopping off branches, fresh shoots will always reappear. "Tis during 
youth you must undertake the energetic eradication of prejudices 
inculcated in childhood. And the most deeply entrenched of them 
all is that which must be the most fiercely combated, I allude to 
that futile and chimerical god, and to curing yourself definitively 
of belief in his existence.” 


676 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“No, Albani, I do not feel that this operation need be num- 
bered among those demanding any outstanding effort from a young 
individual provided he be normally constituted, for the deific 
fallacy cannot subsist fifteen minutes in a sane mind. I ask you, 
indeed, who is it fails to see that a god, this bundle of contradic- 
tions, of quirks and oddities, of incompatible attributes, while he 
may heat the imagination, must appear ludicrous to the intellect? 
Those who scoff at the ided of a god may be reduced to silence, 
so it is thought, by telling them that from the very beginning of 
history and everywhere all men have acknowledged some sort of 
divinity ; that none of the world’s countless peoples is without its 
belief in an invisible and mighty being which it worships and 
venerates; that, finally, no nation, even the most primitive, does 
not entertain the certitude of the existence of some power superior 
to human nature. Firstly, I deny that fact; but even were it so, can 
general conviction transform error into truth? There was a time 
when all men believed the sun revolved about the earth, while the 
latter remained stationary: did this unanimity of belief transform 
the false notion into a reality? There was a time when nobody was 
willing to believe the wor]d was round, those who had the temerity 
to maintain it were persecuted. How wide has been belief in witches, 
in ghosts, in goblins, in apparitions; has the extent of these opinions 
made realities of those illusions? Of course not; but even the most 
reasonable and sensible people somehow feel obliged to believe in 
a universal spirit, without noticing, without bothering to realize, 
that all the evidence refuzes the excellent qualities ascribed to this 
god. Here is a kindly father; large is his family, and from first 
to last all its members, | discover, are unhappy. In the kingdom 
of this so very wise and so very just sovereign I see crime at the 
pinnacle and virtue in irons. You cite the blessings that accrue to 
him who subscribes to this system; among them I perceive a host 
of ills of all sorts which vou stubbornly shut your eyes to. Forced 
to admit that your so exceedingly good god, in perpetual self- 
contradiction, with the same hand distributes good and evil, to 
justify this you are driven to refer me to the fabulous regions of an 
afterlife. Better, I retort, better to invent yourself some other god 
than the god of theology; for yours is as confused as he is 
preposterous, as absurd as he is derisory. A good god who 


Juliette & 677 


does evil or tolerates that it be done, a god of sublime equity 
under whose aegis innocence is always oppressed, a perfect god 
who produces imperfect works only: ah! agree that the existence 
of such a god is more pernicious than useful to mankind, and that 
the best for all concerned would be to annihilate him forever.” 

“Charlatan,” I cried, “you disparage the drugs you trade in: 
what would become of your power and that of your Sacred College 
if everybody was as philosophical as you ?” 

“I am only too well aware,” said Bernis, ‘that error is neces- 
sary to us; men must be imposed upon, to that end we are obliged 
to deceive them. But from this it does not follow that we ought to 
deceive ourselves. Before what eyes are we to unmask the idol if not 
before those of our friends or of philosophers who think like us?” 

‘In that case,” said Olympia, “I should be most grateful if 
you would enlighten my ideas upon a point of morality essential to 
my peace of mind. They have droned their doctrine in my ears a 
thousand times, their definition has never satisfied me: it is of 
human freedom I am speaking; Bernis, what are your views upon 
this question? "Tis your sage commentary I desire.” 

“T shall deliver it,” said the illustrious lover of the Marquise 
de Pompadour, “but I request your whole attention, the matter is a 
rather abstract one for a woman. 

“The faculty of comparing different manners of acting and of 
deciding which appears best to us, this is what is called freedom. 
Now, does man have or does he not have this faculty of decision? 
I am prepared to state that he does not and could not possibly 
have it. All our ideas owe their origin to physical and material 
causes which operate upon us independently of our will, because 
these causes result from our intimate organization and from the 
impact external objects have upon us; motives are in turn the 
results of these causes, and as a consequence our will is not free. 
Prey to conflicting motives, we waver, but in the moment when the 
decision is taken it is not we who determine it; it is enjoined upon 
us, it is necessitated by the various dispositions of our organs; they 
always dictate the direction, we always follow their guidance, the 
choice between this or that alternative is never exercised by us: 
constantly impelled by necessity, the constant slaves of necessity, 
that very instant when we believe we gave the clearest demonstra- 


678 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tion of our freedom is the very one in which we were subject to the 
most invincible constraint. Irresolution, uncertainty allow us to be- 
lieve we are free, but this fancied freedom is nothing but the mo- 
ment when the scales, evenly weighted, hover in equilibrium. The 
decision is arrived at once one of the two sides tips, and it is not we 
who intrude our weight to upset the balance, it is the physical ob- 
jects outside us which act upon us, which reveal us at the mercy of 
our surroundings, the toy of natural influences, as is the case with 
animals, with plants. Everything resides in the action of the neural 
fluid and the difference between a scoundrel and an honest man 
consists in nought but the greater or lesser activity of the animal 
spirits that compose this fluid. 

“““T feel,’ says Fenelon, ‘that I am free, that I am under the 
absolute guidance of my own counsels.’ This gratuitous assertion 
cannot be proven. What assurance has the Archbishop of Cambrai 
that when he decides to embrace the pleasant doctrine of Madame 
Guyon he is free to elect the opposite course? At the very most 
he could prove to me that he hesitated, but, having acted as he did, 
I defy him to convince me he was free to act otherwise. ‘I modify 
myself with God,’ the same author continues, ‘I am the real cause 
of my own willing.’ But, in saying this, Fénelon did not pause to 
realize that he was rendering his omnipotent god the real cause of 
all crimes; neither did he pause to realize that nothing so surely 
makes an end to the omnipotence of god as the freedom of man, 
for this omnipotence you imagine god to possess, and which for the 
sake of the discussion I temporarily grant you, is truly omnipotence 
only because god ordainec. everything from the very beginning, and 
it follows from this immutable and definitive ordination that man 
must be nothing but a passive onlooker, powerless to affect an 
unalterable fait accompli and therefore unfree. If he were free, he 
could, whenever he so willed, alter and thus destroy this original 
order, and in so doing st.ow himself a match for god. Here is a 
problem to which such a partisan of the divinity as Fenelon ought 
to haye devoted maturer reflection. 

‘Newton skipped gingerly around this formidable difficulty, 
he dared neither explore it nor even venture too close to it; Fénelon, 
more forthright although far less learned, adds: ‘When I will some- 


Juliette & 679 


thing, it is in my power not to will it; when I will it not, it is in my 
ower to will it.’ 

“No. If, Sir, you did not do it when you willed it, that is be- 
cause it was not in your power to do it and all the physical causes 
which inflect the scales had tipped them, this time, to the 
side of not doing the thing in question, and the choice was made 
before you arrived at a decision. Therefore, Sir, you were not free, 
and you never are. When you slip into that one of the two alterna- 
tives you adopt, it is because you could not possibly have adopted 
the other. It is your uncertainty that blinded you, you supposed it 
was in your power to choose because you felt it in your power to 
hesitate. But this uncertainty, the physical effect of two foreign 
objects which present themselves simultaneously, and the freedom 
to choose between these two objects, here are two very different 
matters.” 

‘That is enough to convince me,” Olympia rejoiced; “the idea 
of having been able not to commit the crimes I indulged in used 
sometimes to harry my conscience. My unfreedom proven, I am at 
peace with myself and shall continue without misgivings.” 

“T urge you to do so,” said Albani; “remorse of any kind is 
utterly futile. Always coming after the fact, it never prevents it, and 
the passions invariably outshout all scruples when the moment for 
repeating the evil arrives.” 

“Very well then, let us now turn to perpetrating some of this 
delicious evil in order to keep the habit bright and in order to dull 
our regrets over the evil we have done in the past,” said Olympia. 

“By all means,” replied Cardinal de Bernis, “but this projected 
evil, in order that it delight us the more, let us perpetrate it thought- 
fully and on a broad scale. Lovely Juliette,” pursued the ambassa- 
dor of France, “we understand that you have two pretty girls in your 
house, who must certainly be as complaisant as you; their beauty 
has been much bruited about in Rome; we feel, my colleague and I, 
that they should participate in this evening’s libidinous revels and 
invite you to send for them.” 

Owing to the terms IT was on with Olympia, whose glances 
pressed me to accept this proposition, I decided I could not very 
well refuse it and promptly sent a servant to fetch Elise and 
Raimonde; the conversation now took a different turn. 


680 + THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Juliette,” Bernis said to me, “from the eagerness we have just 
manifested to become acquainted with the two notoriously attrac- 
tive creatures you possess, do not rush to the mistaken conclusion 
that my confrere and I are especially partial to a sex whose 
femininity we excuse solely upon the condition it behave in manly 
fashion with us. It is indeed essential we declare to you upon this 
subject that it were better we refrain from devising any scheme for 
amusement rather than have it come to nought as a result of your 
failure, or your companions’, to favor us by an absolute resignation 
to the fantasies this statement implies.” 

“Truth to tell,” Olympia put in, “these explanatory remarks 
are superfluous with Juliette, from the feats I have seen her per- 
form in this genre I may give you every assurance that she will not 
disappoint you; and I have no doubt that her two familiars must, if 
only from the fact they are her protégées, be quite as philosophical 
as she.” 

“Good friends,” said I, striving to put everyone at ease, “my 
reputation for lewdness is sufficiently well established to leave no 
room for doubt upon my manner of conducting myself at such 
forgatherings. My lubricity, always modeled after the caprice of 
the men, is always set alight by the fire of their passions. I am 
truly heated by their desires alone, my keenest pleasure comes only 
from satisfying all their whims. If what they ask of me is common- 
place, my enjoyment is mediocre; let them require the unusual, the 
rarified, of me, and through sympathy I immediately sense the most 
violent desire to content them, and never have I known, no, nor 
conceived of any restriction in acts of libertinage, since the more 
they outrage polite uszge and exceed the bounds of modesty and 
decency, the greater their contribution to my felicity.” 

“And all that is quite as it should be,” Bernis replied, con- 
gratulating me, “and it is greatly to your credit; the prudishness 
that leads a woman to recalcitrance necessarily invalidates her 
claim to the consideration of her associates, and to the esteem of 
reasonable men.” 

“Such refusals are absurd,” advanced Albani, a confirmed 
sectator of all lubricity’s more fanciful practices, “‘they prove noth- 
ing in a woman but stupidity or frigidity, and I do declare to you 
that to those who feel that a female can only make up for her sex 


Juliette & 681 


by the most accommodating behavior, a frigid or stupid woman is 
beyond words contemptible; this is my opinion.” 

“Well,” said I, ‘what woman could be such an idiot as to 
imagine a man does more wrong lodging his prick in her behind 
than sticking it in her cunt? Is not a woman a woman everywhere, 
and is it not extravagant for her to wish to reserve one part of her 
body to modesty while consenting to make free of the others? To 
say this mania can ever outrage Nature, the contention is perfectly 
ridiculous; would Nature instill in us such a taste for it if it were 
offensive to her? Why of course not, we may boldly assert, to the 
contrary, that she cherishes it, that it is favorable to her; that 
human laws, forever dictated by egoism, upon this subject lack all 
common sense, and that Nature’s, far simpler, far more expressive; 
must necessarily inspire in us all the tastes that are inimical to a 
reproduction which, when men undertake it, challenges her right to 
create the species ever anew, displaces her from her prime function, 
and reduces her to an inactivity that jars with her energy.” 

“There is a very pretty thought you have just set forth,” said 
Bernis; “‘to this theoretical erudition I should now like us to join 
a little practice. Let me therefore invite you, lovely Juliette, to give 
us a glimpse of that throne of voluptuousness which, as has been 
intimated to you already, will be the unique object of our caresses 
and of our pleasures. With Olympia’s we have been long and 
exhaustively acquainted; yours will suffice for the time being, will 
youkindly make it available.” 

The two cardinals having drawn near I promptly unveiled the 
shrine at which they would worship. My skirts lifted waist-high, 
their examination began, and it was accompanied, you may be sure, 
by the most elaborate and the most lubricious details. Albani car- 
ried strictness of sodomite manners to the point of disguising 
meticulously everything in the vicinity which I in my bent-forward 
position could not help but bring into view: your authentic sodomist 
will always come unerect at the sight of a cunt. Following the 
touches there were the kisses, the twittering of tongues. And as 
with libertines of this feather barbarity is the usual sequel to 
lubricious impulses, suckings gave way to slaps, then to pinches, 
after that to bitings, to the vigorous, abrupt, and dry introduction 
of several fingers into my anus, finally to proposals of a whipping 


682 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


which would probably have been inflicted in short order had my 
companions not appeared at that juncture. As the adventure I am 
relating now begins to take on an indisputably serious character, 
from here on J shall describe it in the cynically frank style which 
best becomes the subject. 

Enchanted by the two delicious creatures I offered to their 
lewdness, the cardinals s90n demanded to make searching investiga- 
tion of the hindward beauties promised by such a pair of arresting 
lasses as my Elise and Raimonde. Olympia herself fluttered about 
them no less ardently than the men. It was then I drew Albani 
aside, and this is the gist of what I said to him: 

“Saintly man,” I began, “you do not, I am certain, imagine 
that my pretty friends and I have come here to satisfy all your 
brutal whims simply ou: of piety. You must not be misled by the 
figure I cut at Rome; it is the fruit of my prostitutions, they alone 
get me my livelihood: I do not give myself except for money, and 
the price I ask is not trifling.” 

“Bernis and I have always held a similar attitude,” the 
Cardinal told me. 

“Then we should get on,” said I; “indicate to me, if you 
please, the recompense my friends and I may expect in return for 
our services. Not until this matter is settled shall they be rendered.” 

Albani enters into whispered conference with his fellow church- 
man, then both turn back to me and protest I shall be dealt with in a 
manner that will leave me no cause for complaint. 

“Too vague, these assurances,” I retort. “We each of us live 
from our calling, you know: that of eating little flour and water 
symbols earns you five or six hundred thousand pounds a year; 
consider it fitting that from mine, infinitely more agreeable to 
society, and with merit: on its side, I extract as much. You are 
shortly going to reveal a quantity of turpitudes to me; their witness, 
I shall possess your secret and could compromise you by letting it 
out. You will retaliate by denouncing my conduct? But I too have 
enough gold to be listened to, and you will be ruined when my 
lawyers unmask you. For six thousand sequins apiece and your 
agreement to procure a1 audience with the Pope for me, the whole 
affair is arranged, the discussion ended, and nothing but pleasures 
will result for you from all our future relations. Few are the women 


Juliette 2 683 


who can equal me for lewdness, for easiness, for wickedness, and 
what my uncommonly irregular imagination will add to your joys 
may very possibly render them quite as incisive, complete, and bliss- 
ful as any mortal can hope for.” 

“Fair child,” Bernis answered me, “you do not sell yourself 
cheap; but there is no refusing the wishes of one so endearing, you 
shall have your interview with His Holiness. The desire you express 
has already been conceived by him, and since hiding anything from 
you is farthest from our intentions, know that he has ordered the 
organizing of this preliminary party, wanting, before making your 
direct acquaintance, to have a report upon you from us.” 

“Excellent,” said I, “out with the money and I am at your 
disposition.” 

‘“‘What, must you have it at once ?” 

“Right away.” 

“But if we were to pay you first and then you were to take it 
into your head to—” 

“Ah,” I interrupted, raising my hand, “I see you have had 
little experience with women of my nationality. Frank as the 
country whose name they bear, Frenchwomen wish to be sure of 
where they stand before concluding a bargain; but they are in- 
capable of breaking it once they have pocketed the money.” 

At this Albani, upon a gesture from his confrere, ushered me 
into a small room, unlocked a secretary, and out of it drew bank- 
notes in the sum I had stipulated. One glance at that secretary and 
the hoard it contained was quite enough to seduce me. 

Good, said I to myself the moment I had struck upon the ruse 
whereby I was to appropriate that treasure, it is all the more cer- 
tain to succeed considering that the multitude of abominations 
these rascals are going to enact with me will prevent them from 
daring to prosecute me afterward. 

Before the Cardinal has time to shut up his secretary, I, taking 
swift advantage of the moment, sink to the floor in a swoon 
so artfully feigned that an alarmed Albani rushes out in search of 
aid. Quickly I scramble to my feet, pounce upon the banknotes, the 
pocketbooks, and in one swoop make away with a million. I close the 
secretary. Thanks to the hurly-burly, I assure myself, he'll not 


684 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


remember whether he locked the lid or not and, finding it this way, 
will be less apt to suspect me. 

All this accomplished in less time than it takes to tell, I 
resume my position or the floor; in comes Albani, Olympia and 
Bernis on his heels. As they enter I open my eyes, fearing lest in 
the course of efforts to revive me they discover what is not very 
securely cached beneath my skirts. 

“Oh, it’s nothing, nothing, I shall be quite all right,” say I, 
fending them off, “my extreme sensitivity renders me subject to 
nervous cramps every now and then, I am much better now and 
altogether at your orders.” 

Just as I had foreseen, Albani, noticing that his secretary was 
closed, fancied he had left it so and, rather than suspecting any- 
thing amiss, was only :oo happy to lead me into a delicious salon 
where the projected orgies were to transpire. 

There we found eight new personages whose roles were of 
considerable importance in the mysteries about to be celebrated. 
These eight individuals included four boys, fifteen years of age and 
perfect Cupids all; and four. fuckers, between eighteen and twenty, 
and each with a positively monstrous member. Thus were we 
twelve assembled ther: for the amusement of the two lecherous 
collegians, for Olympia’s participation in these scenes was far more 
in the capacity of a victim than a sacrificer: libertinage, greed, ambi- 
tion put her in the service of these masters, and there her employ- 
ment was identical to ours. 

“So now,” said Bernis, “we start. Juliette, and you, Elise and 
Raimonde, by paying the merry price you ask for your hire we buy 
the right to address you as one does whores; serve us with cor- 
responding obedience.” 

“That is only fair,” I observed; ‘do you wish to see us 
naked?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then will you let us have the use of a dressing room where 
my companions and I may leave our clothes. . . .” 

We are shown to one; when we are alone, I divide up my 
bulky loot into three parcels, we each stow one into our pockets, 
remove our garments, and reappear nude in the circle where the 
cardinals are awaiting us. 


Juliette 2 685 


“Now heed me,” said Bernis. ‘‘I shall exercise the master of 
ceremonies’ functions, Cardinal Albani has consented to this; every- 
one will hence comply with my instructions. Your asses, Mesdames, 
cursorily glanced at a short while ago, must be more narrowly 
studied; kindly step forward one by one and offer those articles to 
our criticism, the boys will then do likewise, and after having been 
viewed, each subject will repair directly to some one of the fuckers 
and proceed to dispose him for pleasure, in such wise that the 
review once concluded, we may find each of the four fuckers in the 
hands of a boy and a woman, and in full bloom.” 

The inaugural scene is executed: we passed from the first to 
the second of those libertines. Our hindward parts were kissed and 
palpated, nibbled and gnawed, pinched and scratched, then we 
hastily took up our posts by the fuckers, seeing to it that we were 
a woman and a boy in attendance upon each. 

“And now,” said the master of ceremonies, ‘we must have a 
small boy kneel between our thighs and suck our pricks; a big boy 
will give each of us his to suckle; to excite him, he will have a 
woman’s ass ahead of him, and will tongue it; ready to hand we 
shall have, to the right, a fucker’s prick to dandle, to the left, the 
buttocks of a. small boy, and the two other women, stationed close 
to us and slightly beneath, will tickle our testicles and our assholes. 

“For the third scene,” Bernis informed us, ‘‘we shall remain 
lying down as we are at present; ’twill be the women who shall 
pump us, two small boys kneeling astride our chests will give us 
their assholes to suck, they will kiss, above them, the asses of the 
two women who, themselves, will frig the pricks of the small boys. 
As for the four fuckers, we shall frig them, having our four hands 
free. 

“Thus shall we be marshaled in the forthcoming scene,” con- 
tinued the charming cardinal; “the two women who have not just 
been sucking us will, kneeling at the edge of these sofas, receive our 
pricks into their mouths; the two other women, I mean those who 
sucked us a moment ago, will act as our pimps: they will ready the 
four fuckers to embugger us one after the other, they will socratize 
those fuckers, they will tongue them, they will lick them anally, in 
fine, they will exert themselves unstintingly to bring those four 
members up high and hard, and when once they see the weapons 


686 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


burnished and fit to perforate us, they will with their mouths and 
tongues moisten our vents and carefully pilot the ship into port; the 
four small boys will present their posterior charms to our lips, lying 
before us, belly down.” 

The four fuckers were stout, mettlesome lads: they responded 
splendidly to our efforts. The two ancient, purple breaches were 
each sodomized eight times in a row, solidly and impetuously ; but 
for toughness those two rogues outdid the devil and endured this 
last-mentioned scene as )»hlegmatically as they had the preceding 
ones; we were rewarded by not even a shadow of an erection. 

“Ah ha,” Bernis declared, “ ’tis all too plain we require more 
potent stimulants; ours, you apprehend, is a state of advanced 
decrepitude. Voracious is the appetite of a satiety nothing satisfies, 
the malady is like those consuming thirsts which the coolest well- 
water only increases. Albani is in the same case as I: look there and 
see whether these accumulated efforts have hoisted his prick even 
a single notch. Let us not be disheartened, however, we may try 
other things and indeed we must, a stern Nature commands it. 
You are a dozen; divide. Let each squad be composed of a pair of 
fuckers, two small boys, two women: the first will work upon my 
old friend, the second upon me. Ranged about us, everybody in his 
turn shall be frigged by us, shall suck us successively, and one by 
one shit into our mouths.” 

This disgusting operation saw the pricks of our decayed ad- 
versaries unwrinkle a little and upon the basis of these unmistakable 
albeit faint signs, they judged themselves ready to essay more 
serious attacks. 

‘The sixth scene will be along these lines,” said the director; 
‘Albani, whose faculties appear to be about as aroused as mine, 
shall sodomize Elise, I am going to embugger Juliette; the four 
fuckers, prepared by Olympia and Raimonde, will doctor our asses; 
the small boys, lying atop us, will present to our kisses, some their 
pricks, some their buttocks.” 

The groups form; but our champions, deceived by their de- 
sires, deliver too light an assault upon the tabernacle, falter at its 
gate, and limp away in defeat and chagrin. 

“Bah, I expected as much,” Albani grumbled, “I shall never 


Juliette -& 687 


understand why you persist in wanting to have us embugger women! 
With a boy I’d have sustained no such affront.” 

“Very well then, we shall change,” said the ambassador, 
“what is there to prevent us?” 

But no happier is the issue of this fresh onslaught; our car- 
dinals are fucked, to be sure, but fuck they cannot; friggings, suck- 
ings are to no avail, their antiquated tools shrivel instead of 
deploying, and Bernis announces that, his colleague faring as poorly 
as he, they shall pursue the war in a different manner. 

‘“‘Mesdames,” says that great man, “since kindly treatment 
gets us nowhere with you, harsher methods must be resorted to. 
Do you know the effects of fustigation? It might be that which is 
needed; we shall see.” 

With these words he seizes me, while from a closet Albani 
brings forth an apparatus of such curious design as to deserve 
special description. 

I was bound facing the wall and a short pace from it, my hands 
high above my head, my feet on the floor. Once pinioned, in front 
of me Bernis placed a kind of prayer-stool, but of steel, its upper 
rung a sword-blade, razor-sharp and its edge touching my belly. 
Needless to say, I drew back from that menacing glaive: that is, 
I thrust my flanks back toward Fernis; which was precisely what 
he wanted me to do: never had I struck a prettier pose. Grasping a 
handful of withes, the lecher begins all of a sudden to thrash me 
with all his might, and so terrible are those blows that before. ten 
of them have fallen the blood is streaming down my thighs. Albani 
advanced the infernal machine several inches nearer, gone was all 
possibility of swaying before the strokes to lessen their impact, 
and I must stand firm to the storm: however, I was able to weather 
it without undue difficulty, being, very fortunately, thoroughly 
inured to a ceremony which had often been my delight in the past. 
Those who followed me had not such a merry time of it. Elise, who 
replaced me in that cruel harness, gashed her belly and screamed 
the whole while her flagellation lasted. Raimonde suffered a great 
deal too. Olympia passed valiantly through the ordeal, she was 
fond of whipping; this vexation would only stimulate her. Bernis 
now turned his withes over to Albani, we all four had a second time 
to undergo the operation, and at last our rascals’ pricks came totter- 


688 - THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ing up. Wary of women after that earlier skirmish, they chose 
small boys for their prey; while asodomizing they were flogged, 
and their attitudes were such that they were able to kiss the vulvas, 
assholes, and pricks artistically presented to their libertine atten- 
tions. And exacerbated Nature rescued their honor; they loosed 
almost simultaneous discharges. They are my buttocks Albani 
kisses during his crisis, and it is so violent, so furious is the black- 
guard’s joy, that upon my behind he leaves the imprint of the two 
solitary stumps still surv:'ving in his foul mouth after half a dozen 
visitations of the pox. Raimonde’s ass, embraced by Bernis, came 
off little better; but twas with his fingernails and a penknife this 
roué had molested it, reducing it to tatters by the time his spasm 
supervened. A brief pause ensued, then the orgies were resumed. 

In the opening scene of this second act we were each dispatched 
into the arms of one fucker after another, who encunted us while 
the two debauchees peerd at our asses and to encourage our per- 
formance barbarously pricked, pinched, and beat us in a thousand 
various ways. That done. the couples were rolled over, up came the 
four masculine asses; the four small boys sodomized them, and 
the cardinals ass-fucked those four small boys, but without dis- 
charging. From bum-stufing the fuckers the little chaps moved 
aboard us women, the fuckers revenged themselves upon those 
catamites and next embuggered us while our cunts were licked by 
the small boys. After that, these idyllic little creatures were stood 
against the wall, attached, the steel chair was slid into position, 
and they were lashed to ribbons. At this point our two fauns were 
overtaken by the desire to spill some more seed. Like tigers sensing 
prey somewhere near, they stalk through our midst, casting savage 
glares to right and to left. They order the men to seize and to whip 
us, while they watch they sodomize one small boy apiece and kiss 
the ass of another. Their fuck dribbles forth for the second time, 
and we remove to table. 

A very delicious repast it was that we were served, a very 
picturesque one; with your leave I shall describe it in some detail. 

In the middle of a circular room stood a round table set for 
six; two places were occupied by the cardinals, Olympia, Raimonde, 
Elise, and I occupied the four others. A yard or so behind our 
chairs was the lowest in a series of four tiered benches ringing 


Juliette & 689 


the table concentrically, forming a kind of amphitheater. There, 
fifty of Rome’s choicest courtesans, hidden beneath masses of 
flowers, allowed of themselves only their behinds to be seen, in 
such a way that those clusters of asses peeping out from the lilacs, 
the pinks, the foxgloves seemed scattered about haphazardly, and 
provided, under the same aspect, the image of everything of the 
supremely delicious that Nature and lasciviousness can offer. Twenty 
Cupids represented by pretty bardashes formed a dome overhead, 
and the room was lit by the tapers those little gods held in their 
hands. At the touch of a lever an ingenious device removed one 
course and brought the next on: the rim of the table, where the 
company’s plates and ‘silverware lay, remained stationary, but the 
center of the table sank away and rose again with six little golden 
gondolas containing exquisite and most delicate viands. Six young 
boys, provocatively garbed as so many Ganymedes, waited upon 
us and poured out the rare wines. Our libertines, upon whose in- 
structions we had dressed for the meal, expressed their wish that 
we unclothe ourselves again, but gradually, as the Babylonian whore 
used to do. Thus when the hors-d’oeuvres were brought on it was 
the kerchief that was put aside, the bodice came unlaced when the 
omelettes arrived, and so on until the fruit when the last stitch 
was discarded; whereupon the libertinage and nastiness increased. 
Dessert was served in fifteen miniature boats of green and gold 
porcelain. Twelve little girls of six and seven, adorned only by 
garlands of myrtle and roses, filled our glasses with foreign wines 
and liqueurs. Heads are gaily awhirl, to our libertines’ spirits 
Bacchus restores all the energy necessary to tense the erector nerve, 
the disorder and uproar are at their height, 

“Genial poet,” said the master of the house to Cardinal de 
Bernis, “two bits of enchanting doggerel are going about Rome 
these days, wits attribute them to you: our guests are persons that 
this form of literature is not lost upon, pray favor us with a 
recitation.” 

“They are mere paraphrases,” replied Bernis, “and I am 
rather surprised at their publicity, for I have shown them to nobody 
but the Pope.” 

“Little wonder then if they are the talk of the town. But come, 
Cardinal, we are eager to hear them from the author.” 


690 THE MARQUIS DE SADE

“Certainly,” said Bernis, “I have nothing to conceal from 
philosophers like those present. One is an adaptation of the famous 
sonnet of Des Barreaux,® the other of the Ode to Priapus. I shall 
begin with the first.® 


Sot Dieu! tes jugements sont pleins d’atrocité, 
Ton unique plaisir consiste a l’injustice: 

Mais j’ai tant fair: de mal, que ta divinité 

Doit, par orgueil au moins, m’arréter dans la lice. 


Foutu Dieu! la grandeur de mon impiété 

Ne laisse en ton pouvoir que le choix du supplice, 
Et je nargue les fruits de ta férocité. 

Si ta vaine colére attend que je périsse, 


Contente, en m’écrasant, ton désir monstrueux, 
Sans craindre que des pleurs s’écoulent de mes yeux, 
Tonne donc! je rn’en fouts; rends-moi guerre pour guerre: 


Je nargue, en périssant, ta personne et ta loi. 
En tel lieu de mon coeur que frappe ton tonnerre, 
I] ne le trouvera que plein d’horreur pour toi. 


These lines having been warmly applauded, Bernis delivered 


his Ode. 


Foutre ces Saints et de la Vierge, 
Foutre ces Anges et de Dieu! 

Sur eux tous je-branle ma verge, 
Lorsque je veux la mettre en feu... 
C’est toi que j’invoque a mon aide, 
Toi qui, dans les culs, d’un vit raide, 
Langas le foutre a gros bouillons! 


8 Jacques Vallée, Seigneir des Barreaux, whose connections with Théophile de 
Viau were intimate, was bern at Paris in the year 1602. The impunity and the 
libertinage of these two rakes was quite unparalleled. The well-known sonnet alluded 
to here (and it is one of the most execrable pieces of poetry to be found in that or any 
other age) was, it is said, composed during an illness; Vallée afterward disavowed 
it. And indeed it is not a production any healthy man would own to. Paraphrased in 
this manner, our readers may perhaps find it somewhat less unendurable. 

9 Cardinal de Bernis addressed the convives in Italian; Juliette has rendered his 
scandalous verses into French. Here we reproduce her version, which reveals much 
poetic skill, much verve. Even if these were not entirely lost in English translation, 
they would be less than sufficiently appreciated by the English reader whose suscepti- 
bilities they might offend.—Tr.

fable into his work when he- ought only to have ridiculed those of 
Christianity. 

More electrified than ever, the company got up from table 
in a state of general ind utter drunkenness to stagger off into 
another magnificent salon. There we found the fifty courtesans 
whose asses we had observed during the banquet, there too was 
the brotherhood of six: little boy-servants, and the dozen dessert 
maidens. The delicate age of those little nymphs, their interesting 
faces wrought prodigiously upon our lechers, who leapt like very 
lions upon the two youngest. Failing to fuck them, their wrath 
mounted. At length they bound them, wheeled forth their infernal 
machine, and with necdle-tipped martinets hammered and hacked 
away at the tender little prisoners; we frigged them, sucked them 
during this; they stiffened. Two other maids are laid hold of; the 
libertines succeed in sodomizing them by dint of art; but wishing 
to husband their forzes, they abandon these victims and spring 
upon new ones: their lubricity feeds now upon little boys, now 
upon little girls; all of that infant generation passes through their 
hands, and it is only after having each depucelated seven or eight 
children of the one sex and the other that the flame of their lust 
sputters out, Albani’; in the ass of a ten-year-old boy, Bernis’ in 
the bowels of a six-year-old girl. Both ecclesiastics, dead drunk, 
tumble onto couches and are sound asleep in a trice. .. . We dress. 

Fuddled from zlcohol and fucking though I was, the idea of 
theft was ever clear in my head and my taste for it in no wise 
dampened: I remembered that first raid into Albani’s treasury had 
not entirely emptied it. So, telling Raimonde to distract Olympia, 
with Elise to help rie I return for another assault upon the Car- 
dinal’s secretary. I locate the key, we pillage everything in sight. 
This second capture added to the first brings my burglaries to a total 
of fifteen hundred thousand francs; and we leave, Olympia having 
noticed nothing. Fancy, good friends, how pleased my gentleman 
consort was when he saw me return home laden with such booty. 
Several days later, however, Olympia came knocking on my door. 

“The Cardinal has been robbed of better than a million,”’ she 
informed me; “‘it was his niece’s dowry the thieves took. Not that 
he suspects you, Juliette, but he wonders whether the deed, per- 
petrated the same day the party was held at his villa, may not 


Juliette & 695 


have been the daing of your two companions. Do you know anything 
of the matter ?” 

And here, as was my custom, I consulted my imagination for 
some infernal horror to cover the one by which I had soiled myself. 
I had indirectly learned that on the very eve of my visit to Villa 
Albani, another of his nieces, whom he had endeavored to seduce, 
had fled the Cardinal’s palace to escape the threat to her virtue. 
I remind Olympia of that niece’s abrupt departure, have her 
remark the coincidence, my insinuations are willingly listened to 
and swiftly communicated to the Cardinal who from weakness 
or from spite, perhaps simply to be revenged for a slight, straight- 
way puts all the Papal State’s bloodhounds on his niece’s trail. The 
poor girl is overtaken on the confines of the Kingdom of Naples 
at the very moment she has sought refuge in a Cistercian convent; 
arrested in that institution and from there dragged back to Rome, 
she is thrown into a dungeon. Sbrigani recruits witnesses to testify 
against her, it now but remains to establish what she has done 
with the money ; other witnesses, also suborned by us, give evidence 
that she handed all the fortune over to a certain Neapolitan who 
had left Rome at the same time as she, and who, they allege, is 
her paramour. .. . All these depositions fit so nicely one to the next, 
each is made to appear so plausible, the whole so conclusive that 
the trial ends on the seventh day with the poor creature’s sentence 
to death. She was decapitated on San Angelo Square, and I had 
the pleasure of watching the execution, seated beside Sbrigani who 
maintained three active fingers in my cunt during all those grisly 
and rousing proceedings. 

‘“O Supreme Being!” I cried inwardly once the axe stood in 
the block and the severed head lay in the basket, “thus is innocence 
avenged by thee, thus dost thou make triumph the cause of those of 
thy children who serve thee best in their faithful practice upon 
earth of the goodliness whereof thine attributes are the perfect 
image. I rob the Cardinal, that niece of his he lusts after flees him 
to prevent a grave sin from being committed: my crime’s reward 
is spasms of joy, she perishes on the scaffold. Holy and Sublime 
Being! such are thy ways, such the fates whereunto thy loving 
hand guideth us mortals—aye, ’tis fitting, is it not, that we adore 
thee!” 


696 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Throughout these and the rest of my disorders the thought 
of the charming Duchess Grillo preyed ever upon my mind. No 
more than twenty years of age, for the past eighteen months bound 
in matrimony to a man of sixty whom she detested, Honorine 
Grillo was, carnally speaking, still as much a stranger to that old 
faun as the day her mother had withdrawn her from the Ursuline 
convent at Bologna to marry her to him. Not that the Duke had 
made no efforts to vanquish his wife’s resistance; but up until now 
they had been fruitless. Only twice had I called upon the Duchess, 
the first time on a visit of courtesy to present my letters of recom- 
mendation, the second for the sake of once again savoring the 
inconceivable pleasure I experienced while in her society. This third 
time I went fully determined to declare my passion to her, firmly 
resolved to satisfy it regardless of the obstacles her virtue might 
put in my way. 

It was after one of those lubricious toilettes which are nothing 
if not apt to seduce and ensnare whatever stoutly armored heart 
that I presented myself at her residence. Luck smiled upon my 
schemes, I found the darling alone. After venturing the initial 
compliments I let my eves speak; modesty bade my quarry avoid 
them. For amorous glances I then substituted encomiums and 
coquetry; catching one of the Duchess’ hands, ‘Delicious woman,’ 

I exclaimed, “if there te a God in heaven and if he be just, then 
surely you are the happ.est woman in all the world, as you are the 
most beautiful.” 

‘°Tis your indulgence leads you to say such things, but I am 
able to be fair to myself.” 

“Oh, Madame, fairness would demand that the very gods 
relinquish their altars to you: she who is so wonderfully deserving 
of a universe’s homage ought to dwell nowhere save in a temple.” 

And I seized her other hand, too, squeezed and kissed them 
both while speaking. 

‘Why do you flatter me?” asked Honorine, the color rising 
into her cheeks. 

“Because I adore you.” 

‘“‘But—but can women fall in love with women ?” 

“And why not! The greater their sensibility, the greater 
their capacity for worshiping the beautiful, whether it be in male 


Juliette & 697 


or female form. Wise women shun relations with men, relations 
so fraught with danger . . . those they may entertain with one 
another are so sweet—ah, my dearest Honorine, I must call you 
Honorine, why might I not be all at once your intimate friend... 
your lover ... your mate?” 

‘‘Mad, reckless creature!” replied the Duchess, “do you 
actually suppose you could be all those things ?”” 

‘I am confident of it, yes,” I answered heatedly as I hugged 
her in my arms, “yes, and above all the last of them, that shall I 
be par excellence if you would have it so, my angel.” 

And my fiery tongue glides into her mouth. 

Honorine receives the kiss of love, receives it without offense, 
and when I essay a second, love itself returns it: the freshest, the 
prettiest little tongue slips forth to quiver between my burning lips. 
My boldness grows; drawing aside the veils screening the loveliest 
of bosoms, with impassioned caresses I assault those alabaster 
breasts, my joyous tongue lovingly teases their pink nipples, while 
my hands stray over the rest. Stirred, Honorine bends to my will; 
the keenest interest fills her big blue eyes, gradually they begin to 
sparkle, tears of pleasure gather there, and I... I, like unto a 
Bacchante, wild, drunk from lust .. . unable to stop, unable to go 
fast enough, I strive to communicate to her the ardor which devours 
me.... 

‘What are you doing?” Honorine demands, but in a sigh. 
‘Are you not forgetting your sex and mine ?” 

‘‘Ah, dearest love,” I rejoin, “may we not sometimes outrage 
Nature if thereby we discover how to render her better homage? 
And how unhappy we must be, alack, if we refrained from seeking 
compensation for the wrongs we suffer at her hands.” 

And ever more enterprising, I dare loosen the ribbons of a 
lawn petticoat and now have in my grasp almost all the charms 
whose possession I so passionately covet. Startled—electrified by 
my hoarse sighs and labored panting—Honorine ceases entirely to 
resist. I press her backward, she is now lying upon the couch, 
avidly I spread her thighs apart and she gives me to ruffle de- 
lightedly that fluffiest little bush, and to fondle the most sweetly 
swelling little mound you could ever hope to see; one of my arms 
encircles the reclining Duchess’ waist, with that hand I stroke one 


698 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of her breasts, my mouth fastens upon the other; my fingers had 
already begun to probe for her clitoris, I was testing its sensitivity. 

. Great God! how it twitched and thrilled. Honorine came nigh 
to fainting under those deft pollutions of mine. Despite the strug- 
gles of her hard-pressed virtue, some moans announce its rout; at 
that signal I redouble my caresses. 

Nobody is more skilled than I at aiding pleasure to attain its 
crisis. . . . I sense my darling’s need of help: some pumping is 
required to make the honeyed sap flow. Few women, it should be 
said in passing, few woraen sufficiently well realize the need their 
cunt has to be sucked as their fuck builds to the discharging point; 
and nevertheless at such moments there is no diviner service one 
may render them. With ‘what ardor I now fulfilled this task; kneel- 
ing between Honorine’s glorious thighs, I clutch her flanks and lift 
them to me, I drive my tongue into her cunt, I suck it, I pump it, 
and in the meantime my nuzzling promotes the erection of her 
clitoris. What buttocks my hands knead! Never had Venus ones so 
lovely! I felt called upon to broaden this into a general conflagra- 
tion; these crises, you know, cannot be too carefully tended, too 
lavishly ministered to. All restrictions must be barred; and if to 
the woman you frig Nature had given twenty avenues for receiv- 
ing pleasure, you would have to attack them all with a view to 
increasing the tumult in her a hundredfold.”* So I go in quest of her 
pretty little anus in order that the titillations produced by a digit 
buried there may be added to those my mouth is causing her on the 
other side. So tiny, so strait, is this cunning little hole I have diff- 
ae) finding it, but there it is at last, one of my fingers pops into 
it. .. . Delicious episode! ah, never do you fail to have your effect 
‘ipsa a woman of sensibility. No sooner has this charming little 
vent been invaded than Honorine sighs . . . she smiles, is in rap- 


14 Nine out of every ten men who take it upon themselves to frig women are 
less than adequately convinced of their patient’s urgent need at such time to have 
pleasure penetrate into her through every pore. He who would procure her a 
voluptuous emission must hence manage in such sort that he keeps his tongue in her 
mouth, is able to fondle her breasts, has a finger in her vagina, another upon her 
clitoris, a third in her asshole. Idle were his expectations of attaining the mark who 
neglects but one of these circumstances. Whence it is that at least three are required 
in order to drive a woman truly out of her mind. 


Juliette & 699. 


tures, this heavenly woman! She discharges, she is in the sweetest 
eestasy imaginable, and ’tis to me her delirium is owing. 

‘“‘Ah, my angel, my beloved angel, I adore you,” 
says to me as she opens her eyes to the light, ‘‘you slew me with 
happiness. How ever can I repay you?” 

“In kind, my dear, in kind,” I reply, snatching off my skirts. 
And taking hold of her hand, clapping it to my cunt: “Frig me, my 
love, frig me into a lather. Great heaven, what else is there to do 
but frig ?”” 

However, like all well-bred women, Honorine was clumsy: 
she aroused desires in me and knew not how to cope with a single 
one of them. I was obliged to give her lessons. 

Coming at length to the conclusion that she might do a better 
job with her tongue than her fingers, I have her get between my 
legs and she licks my cunt while I take my frigging personally in 
hand. Here Honorine performed creditably. Prodigiously excited 
_ by the delightful creature, I shot three discharges into her mouth. 
. .. Overcome now by a desire to see her entirely nude, I raise her 
up, rid her of all she is wearing. .. . Oh, God! this sudden splendor 
that met my gaze, ’twas as though I were looking upon the star of 
daylight when in springtime it shines through a long winter’s mists. 
Ah, I may truly say that I had never seen so beautiful an ass, never. 
What radiant fairness! What gleaming exquisite skin, how soft! 
What breasts, what hips! And that waist; those incomparable 
buttocks! Ah, that ass. Sublime altar of love and of pleasure, not a 
day goes by, no, not a single day passes but my imagination dwelling 
yearningly upon you, as it were stretching forth its arms toward 
you, offers you some fresh homage.... 

I could not resist the sight of that divine posterior. Manlike 
in my tastes as in my thinking, how bitterly I regretted that I was 
unable to burn some more real incense before my idol. I kissed it, 
opened it and gazed ecstatically therein, my tongue sounded it and 
while it thrilled in that celestial hole I refrigged lovely Honorine’s 
clitoris: thus did I wheedle a fresh discharge from her. But the 
more I aroused her, the greater was my distress at being powerless 
to arouse her farther still. 

“Oh, my dearest one,” said I, my heart heavy because of this 
regret, “be sure that when next we come together I shall have by 


that dove |

me some instrument capable of dealing more telling blows than 
may a tongue: I would be your lover, your husband, I have told 
you so: I wish to have you as might a man.” 

“Ah, do anything with me you want,” was the Duchess’ gentle 
reply to this, “multiply the proofs of your love, in return I shall 
give you back twice as many tokens of mine.” 

Honorine wishes now to see me nude, her eyes rove over my 
body; but she is so newly come to pleasure that she ignores the art 
of giving it to me. ... Ah, it mattered not to my flaming soul: she 
gazed upon me, she examined me: I was fucked by the rays of her 
glances, and extreme was my happiness. O lubricious women! if ever 
you are in the position I was in, you will sympathize with me, you 
will taste the despair wherein one is hurled by thwarted desires, and 
like me you will curse Nature for having inspired in you feelings 
which the buggeress cannot satisfy. .. . We fell to frolicking anew. 
Though not able to give each other all the relief we both needed, we 
nevertheless gave each other as much as we could, and upon 
separating promised to meet soon again. 

Just two days after this scene Olympia called upon me; she 
had found out I had been to see the Duchess; she was jealous. 

“Flonorine is attractive, it cannot be denied,” said she, ‘neither 
will you deny that she is stupid; I defy her ever to give you as much 
pleasure as I. Moreover, Juliette, there is that husband of hers. He 
has a keen nose, you would be running a grave risk if he were to 
begin to scent this intrigve.” 

“Dear friend,” said I to Princess Borghese, ‘allow me a 
fortnight, I ask no more: by then I shall have made my attitude 
toward Honorine quite clear to you. For the time being, I shall 
confess this, and be reassured by it: now and then I may divert 
myself with virtue but only crime has the place of privilege in my 
heart.” 

“Then we shall speak no more of the matter,” said the Prin- 
cess, embracing me warmily; “‘you have said enough to dispel my 
fears. I shall be there when you emerge from your illusion, and I 
doubt not but that it will be short-lived with Grillo. 

“But let us change the subject,” she went on. “Were you not 
surprised the other day to see me play the whore as merrily as 
you?” 


Juliette ® 701 


“No, truthfully, I was not,’’ said I. “Knowing the kind of 
mind you have, I could expect libertinage to be your one concern.” 

“Ha, I have others as well, my dear. Those two cardinals rule 
the roost at the Vatican, and I have my reasons for humoring them; 
apart from that they pay me liberally, and I too am fond of money. 
Come now, Juliette, be honest with me, you did rob Albani, didn’t 
you? Have no fear, I’ll not let your secret out nor reproach your 
deed, not I, for I too rather incline toward little knaveries of the 
sort, and who knows? I may have pilfered as much from those 
rascals as you: theft is delicious, my angel, it heats. It can even 
precipitate a discharge—this is usually the case with me. It is base 
to steal for your living, delightful to steal at the behest of passion.” 

Such and so many were the things Olympia and I had done 
together that I considered I could depend upon her tact and 
discretion. It seems to me that one may safely confess a peccadillo 
to the person who acts as your collaborator in a major crime. 

“That you come to know me better, this is one of my cherished 
aims,” I told Olympia; “your conjectures flatter me: yes, I com- 
mitted that theft. More, I helped send to her doom the innocent 
who was beheaded for my deed, and this compilation of little bits 
of mischief proved enough to cause me some voluptuous discharg- 
ing.” 

: “Ah yes, by fuck, such words have a familiar ring to me. For 
it was hardly a year ago I did just about the same thing, and I am 
well acquainted with all the amenities which result from these 
breaches of good conduct. 

“But my chief purpose in coming to see you is to announce 
that we shall shortly be supping with the Pope; Braschi would 
have us participate in his appalling excesses. Appalling, I repeat, 
for the Vicar of Christ is to an astounding degree depraved, im- 
pious, bloodthirsty; it must be seen to be believed. Near the place 
where these orgies will be celebrated is the treasury room of the 
State, I know how to unbar its door: there are millions there for 
the taking. And trust me, Juliette, taking them will not be difficult : 
His Holiness will not dare so much as object, not after the things 
we shall have been witness to. You will join me in this expedition ?” 

“Of course.” : 

“IT may have confidence in you ?”’ 


702 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Can you doubt it when the question is one of a crime?” 

“Grillo must never hear anything of this, Juliette.” 

“Count somewhat more heavily upon my intelligence; and 
think not, dear Princess. that a passing fancy could cause me to 
compromise or neglect a passion: indulging a taste amuses me, but 
it is infamy I take seriously, it alone has access to my heart, it alone 
has the power to inflame me, only to it do I really belong.” 

‘“‘Ah, the properties of crime are unique,” Olympia affirmed, 
“nothing else has such an exciting effect upon me: compared to it 
love is so drab, so puny! Oh indeed, my friend,” she went on, “I 
have reached the point where if I am to be stirred even in the 
slightest, a crime must be of uncommon strength. Those which 
vengeance led me to commit seem contemptible now that you have 
introduced me to those we perform for lewdness’ sake.” 

“Quite so,” I agreed, ‘“‘the most enjoyable crimes are the 
motiveless ones. The victim must be perfectly innocent: if we have 
sustained some harm from him it legitimates the harm we do him, 
and lost to our iniquity is the keen pleasure of exerting itself 
gratuitously. Evil must be done, bad one must be, this is the great 
and indispensable thing; and is it possible when your victim, no 
better than you, merits his fate? Ingratitude is to be recommended 
at all times and especially in this case,” I continued, “your ingrati- 
tude is a further affliction to the person you outrage: you force him 
to regret ever having given you pleasure, and this in itself can 
afford you an enormous cne.” 

‘Yes, yes, I follow your meaning,” Olympia replied, “and I 
believe I have some rare joys of this kind awaiting me. 

“My father lives, he is forever outdoing himself in kindness 
toward me, he heaps gifts upon me, adores me; twenty times over 
have I discharged at the thought of severing such a tie: I dislike 
indebtedness, it weighs disagreeably upon my heart, stifles me— 
I long to be rid of this burden. Moreover, ’tis said parricide is a 
very black crime. You have no idea how it tempts me. . . . But 
listen to me now, Juliette, judge to what lengths my perfidious 
imagination goes. You must change your customary role. Were 
someone else to avow a similar desire, you would, I know, cheer 
him on, clear obstacles fom his path; you would prove to him 
that when all has been considered, there is, strictly speaking, no 


Juliette & 703 


wrong whatever in killing one’s father; and as you are exceedingly : 
clever and eloquent, too, your arguments would soon convince him. | 
I shall ask you to employ very different tactics here; we shall retire 
together into some quiet nook, you will frig me; while you do so 
you will have me appreciate the full horror of the crime in question ; 
you will represent the punishments that are meted out to parricides, 
you will harangue me, exhort me, endeavor to scare me into 
abandoning my plan; the greater your efforts to deter, to convert 
me, the more fixed I shall become in the idea of the crime I am 
projecting, and unless I am mistaken, a voluptuous tension of 
prodigious violence ought to be engendered by this conflict— 
whence I shall emerge victorious.” 

‘To ensure the complete success of the scene you meditate,” 
I ventured to suggest, “third persons should figure in it; and it 
will be necessary not that I frig you throughout, but that I 
chastise you. There is nothing for it, I shall have to whip you.” 

‘Whip me? Why, of course, Juliette! You are right, infinitely 
right,” said Olympia; “‘your conceptions are more delicate than 
mine. But who shall these third persons be ?”’ 

‘‘Raimonde and Elise; they will suck you, they will deliciously 
frig you during my discourse; and I shall beat you.” 

‘‘And after that we shall go straight to work?” 

‘Have you the instruments for it?” 

“T do.” 

‘“What kind ?” 

“Three or four sorts of poison; these are commodities of 
everyday use at Rome, as easily to be had as an ounce of salt or 
a piece of soap.” 

‘Those you have purchased are violent ?”” 

‘No, rather slow as a matter of fact. Mild but dependable.” 

“That won’t do. If one is to enjoy the thing properly, the 
victim in such cases must suffer, his agonies must be hideous. While 
he is in their throes one frigs oneself, and how do you expect to 
discharge if his pain is not excruciating? Here,” said I, taking from 
a drawer a small packet of one of Durand’s most potent confec- 
tions, “have the author of your days swallow some of this: his 
miseries will last forty hours and they will be almost unbearable to 
see, his body will literally come to pieces before your eyes.” 


704 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Oh, fuck! Quickly, Juliette, let us make haste, the mere 
sound of your words is causing me to discharge.” 

Elise and Raimonde enter; Olympia bends over them both, 
presenting me her superb buttocks, bare; I flog her with skill, 
caressingly at first, then fiercely, then savagely, and during this 
itual address her in roughly these terms: 

“For certain, the most dreadful crime in all the world is to 
take the life of the person who gave life to us,” I begin. “The 
object of his devotion aid of his solicitude, do we not incur an 
immense debt to him, do we not owe him our eternal thanks? Can 
we have any more sacrecl duty than to protect and care for him? 
Crimmal must be the very idea of harming a hair on his head, and 
that wretch who entertains it merits the very promptest and ex- 
tremest punishment, and none can be too heavy nor too awful for 
a horror of this magnitude. Ages were to pass before our ancestors 
could even comprehend the thing, and ’twas only in fairly recent 
times they promulgated laws to repress the scoundrel who assassi- 
nates his father. The monster able to be this forgetful of all 
natural sentiments deserves to be put to yet uninvented tortures, and 
everything of the very cruelest that can be imagined strikes me as 
retribution too mild for this atrocity. And no warning can be too 
solemn for him in whom barbarity, ingratitude, the repudiation of 
all duties, the renunciation of all principles are such that he is 
capable even of dreaming of destroying that father whence he has 
received the blessing of existence. Ye furies of Tartarus, come 
howling out of your dens, come hither your own selves and organize 
torments fitting to this revolting execration, and however unspeak- 
able those you devise, they shall be less than what the offense 
demands.” 

And while speaking [ was plying the lash, I was tearing whole 
patches of ‘skin off my whore who, her brain sotted by lust, crimes, 
and delights, was discharging and redischarging uninterruptedly 
under the deft hands polluting her. 

“You make no mention of religion,” said she, “I should like 
to have you approach’ my crime from the theological side and 
thunder a little about the outrage to the divinity it is purported to 
constitute. I should like you to talk about God to me, to tell me 


Juliette & 705 


how sorely I offend him; to delineate the inferno where demons will 
roast me after mortals have massacred my body.” 

“Ha!” I then cried, “ha! abject sinner, have you any inkling. 
of the enormity of the insult you are about to hurl at the Supreme 
Being in consummating this abomination? That mighty Lord, image 
of all virtues, that God who is our Father in this world, must he not 
be dismayed and aghast at an offense which compromises him so 
grievously ? Oh, indeed, thoughtless one, be certain that the very 
worst of hell’s tortures are reserved for those who have damned 
themselves by this frightful crime you plot, and that apart from 
the remorse you shall be racked by in this world, in the next you 
shall be rent by all the material woes wherewith a just God shall 
smite ye.” 

“TI would have more on this chapter,” said the libertine Prin- 
cess; “gratify me now with an account both of the physical pains 
of the ordeal in store for me and of the shameful blot which must 
forever attach to the memory of me and remain ineffaceably upon 
my family.” 

“Lost soul,” I thereupon exclaimed, “‘is it then as nought to 
you, this cloud of shame under which, as a consequence of your base 
crime, all your descendants will lie everlastingly? Behold your 
posterity which, for the brand marking its brow, dares not raise its 
head and cringes in the sight of all mankind; there in the depths of 
the grave into which your crimes are soon to send you, do you hear 
the later generations of your line curse the name of her who brought 
them into disgrace and ignominy? This so noble and distinguished 
name, do you see it sullied by your horrors? And the awful torments 
awaiting you, say, does your imagination visualize them? Do you 
feel the avenging iron suspend its tremendous rebuke above you? 
And fall to detach this beautiful head from this impure body whose 
foul, odious lusts can bring you to the point of committing such a 
deed? It shall be horrible, this pain, which abates not till long after 
the head has been chopped off the shoulders; but even were that not 
so, consider that Nature, so profoundly outraged by you, would be 
no less than duty-bound to work the miracle that prolongs your 
sufferings beyond the very limits of eternity.” 

Here the Princess was attacked by a new storm of pleasure, 


706 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


such was its wild violence that she fainted away. . . . She reminded 
me of the Florentine Countess Donis brewing the murder of her 
mother and daughter. 

Ah, said I to myself, what extraordinary mentalities these 
Italian women have. Fortunate it was I came to this country; in no 
other could I have found monsters of my stripe. 

“Ah, by. God’s fuck, the pleasure I have had,” murmured 
Olympia, when she returned to her senses and rubbed brandy upon 
the wounds my lashing had left on her buttocks. ‘So then,” said she, 
smiling, “now that my calm is restored let us glance a moment at 
the facts. Give me your sincere opinion, Juliette: is it really a crime 
to kill one’s father ?”’ 

‘Why bless me, I think nothing of the sort.” 

And in this connection citing in extenso what long ago Noir- 
ceuil had said to me at the time Saint-Fond was engaged in his 
patricidal projects, so completely did I set this charming woman’s 
mind at ease that if she had been anxious or in doubt heretofore, 
all her fears were banisiied now; and she decided action would be 
‘taken on the morrow. I aided her in preparing the several doses 
her father was to absorb; and with a hundred times more daring 
than did ever Brinvilliers show, Olympia Borghese slew the man 
who had given her life, and joyously watched him the whole long 
while he writhed in atrocious agony and finally disintegrated under 
the effects of the fatal pction I had counseled her to employ. 

The deed done, she returned. 

“You frigged yourself, of course?” 

“Of course, to utter shreds,” the rascal assured me, ‘I ended 
up bloody-cunted at his bedside: Never were the Parcae deeper 
drenched in fuck and it yet seeps out of me even as I recall the 
dog’s pratings and his contortions. Oh, Juliette, let not the fire die 
out of me, I have come running to you, make the embers blaze up 
again. Make me discharge, precious Juliette, incomparable Juliette. 
It is with fuck one must wash remorse for crime away—” 

‘Remorse! Bugger-fuck me, is it possible to feel remorse over 
what you have done?” 

‘No, surely not—but, don’t you see, I... . Ah, no matter, just 
frig me, Juliette, just frig me; I must exhaust myself, I must 
discharge. ...” 


Juliette & 707 


Never before had I seen her in such a lively state. Ah, my 
friends, ’tis so, and well ye know it, crime embellishes a woman as 
does nothing else. Olympia was pretty, no more than that. But the 
moment she had committed this crime she took on an angelic love- 
liness. How intense, I then realized, is the pleasure one receives 
from someone cleansed of all prejudices and’ soiled by every crime. 
When Grillo frigged me I had experienced an everyday sensation; 
but when I was in Olympia’s hands, my brain too would be irritated, 
I would be quite beside myself. 

That same day, having just accomplished the worst of all 
crimes and her senses all aglow, the rascal invited me to go along 
with her to a house hard by the Corso where, if I cared to, I might 
join in an altogether unusual party. We arrive; an elderly woman 
preets us. 

“Will you be having many guests this evening?” Olympia 
inquired of her. 

‘“‘A great many, Princess,” the matron answered; “they come 
in droves on Sunday.” 

“Then let us establish ourselves,” said Olympia. 

We were shown to an attractive little room. Here were 
several low couches so placed that from them we had a clear view 
of the adjoining room and of the three or four whores in it. 

“What might this be?” I wondered, “and what curious pleas- 
ure are you preparing for me ?” 

“Keep a close eye on the scene nearby,” said Olympia. “In 
the space of the seven or eight hours we shall be here, whole legions 
of monks, of priests, of abbots, of youths are going to put them- 
selves in the hands of those girls. The number of patients will be 
all the larger since it is I who pay the expenses, their amusement 
costs these gentlemen nothing. As soon as a whore has a prick in 
her hand she will display it to us; if it does not suit us, they will be 
apprised of the fact by our silence; whereas if it pleases us, they 
will hear this little bell ring: the possessor of the desired prick will 
move directly into this room and will regale us to the limit of his 
abilities.” 

“Delightful,” said I, “this arrangement is completely new to 
me, and I propose to make the most of it. Independently of the 


708 <%& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleasure I may anticipate with the fellows who appeal to me, there 
will be the other, the piquant one, of observing how the rest 
disport with those sluts.’’ 

“Exactly,” said Madame Borghese; ‘‘and while we ourselves 
discharge we shall be seeing them fuck.” 

Olympia had only finished pronouncing these words when a 
tall seminarian appeared. He was a pretty young man of twenty or 
so, strongly made and virile; into the hands of one of the whores 
he deposits a member seven inches round behind the knob and 
twelve inches long over-all. So gorgeous a prize could not but 
interest us, and when ‘twas offered we rang the bell loudly. 

“Go into the next room,” says the whore upon hearing the 
signal, ‘‘this machine of yours will be more appreciated there than 
here.” 

The great clod arrives pike aloft. Olympia catches it and 
crams it into my cunt. 

‘Fuck away, my dear, don’t wait for me,” says she, “I'll be 
served before long.” 

I fall to. My rascal has scarcely discharged when another 
divinity student, rung for by Olympia, walks in and stuffs her as 
copiously as I have just been. 

He and his confrere are followed by two sbirri,®© these by 
two Augustinian friars; a pair of Observant friars, doleful, morose 
creatures, come next, and are replaced by two very randan Capu- 
chins; after them it was. a stream of coachmen, scullions, sweeps, 
hairdressers, bumbailiffs, butchers, and lackeys. So vast was this 
crowd, and among it so many awesome members, that I was at last 
obliged to beg quarter. "was, I think, after the one hundred 
ninetieth that I besouglt my companion to bring a halt to this 
deluge of fuck which had been pouring into me before and, as I 
trust you have already surmised, behind. 

“‘God’s aching asshole,” I groaned, picking myself wearily up, 
“tell me, Princess, do you play often at this game?” 

“Seven or eight times a month,” Olympia confessed; “I’m used 
to it, I never tire of it anymore.” 

“I congratulate you; as for me, I am a dry wreck. I discharge 


15So are those officers denominated who stand the watch and arrest thieves 
in Rome. 


Juliette & 709 


too much and too quickly, it’s my undoing.” 

“Come, we shall bathe and sup together,” said Olympia, ‘and 
tomorrow you shall be as good as new.” 

The Princess took me home with’ her, and after two hours in 
the. bath we sat down at table, in no state to undertake anything 
beyond a sweet and lubricious conversation. 

“Did you have any in the ass?” the Princess asked. 

“Certainly,” I answered; “how on earth would you have had 
me withstand so many assaults in only one sector ?”” 

“La,” said Olympia. “‘Cunt-fuck was all I had time to do. For 
I did not foresee you would wish to stop so soon; twenty-four hours 
is my usual stint at that house, and I do not swing round my ass to 
the fuckers until they have made a hash of my cunt. A hash, yes. 
Transformed it into an open wound.” 

“Dear Olympia! Among libertine women I have never en- 
countered your superior. Ah, none so well as we apprehend that 
‘tis by way of the various and ascending stages of secret excesses 
everything else is to be attained. ] am a slave of those voluptuous 
episodes, each day I discover I have found some new habit as a 
result of them, charming habits which turn into so many little 
rituals, little homages one offers to one’s physical nature and which 
are wonderfully pleasing to one’s spiritual self. 

“These divine flights of overindulgence, amongst which one 
must not neglect to include immoderate eating and drinking, of 
prime necessity in that they inflame the nervous humours and con- 
sequently determine the voluptuous mood; these self-pamperings, I 
say, have a gradual degenerating effect and tend before long to 
render excesses indispensable. Now, it is in excess pleasure exists. 
What therefore are we better advised to do than maintain ourselves 
constantly in the state pleasure demands? But there are,” I con- 
tinued, “scores and scores of little habits, dirty and furtive ones, 
loathsome and ugly ones, crapulous and brutal ones, which, perhaps, 
my gentle dove, you are still to make acquaintance of. I shall 
whisper them in your ear: they will prove to you that the celebrated 
La Mettrie was right when he said’® that we humans must wallow 
in filth like swine and ought like them to seek pleasure in the ulti-

710 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


mate degrees of corruption. As regards all this I have had some 
very singular experiences, and I shall tell you about them. I wager 
it has never occurred to you, for example, that by numbing two or 
three of the faculties of sensation one may extract astonishing 
things from the others; whenever you like I shall demonstrate this 
remarkable truth. In the meantime accept my word for it, that 
generally speaking ‘tis when we have achieved depravation, in- 
sensibility, that Nature begins to yield us the key to her secret 
workings, and that it cannot be pried away from her save through 
outrages.” 

“Long have I been firmly persuaded of these maxims,” Olym- 
pia replied, ‘but, woe is me, I am now at a loss to know what 
outrages to inflict upon the sublime jade. I run this Court at my 
will. Pius VI was once my lover, our relations are still amicable and 
fréquent. Through his protection and the influence it procures me 
I have acquired a total impunity, and I have ridden it too long and 
too far, everything has lost its savor for me, my dear, I am sur- 
feited. Upon. this parrizide I have just accomplished I founded 
exaggerated hopes; projecting it aroused my senses a thousand 
times more than carrying it out satisfied them: nothing measures 
up to the stature of my desires. But too much have I reasoned on 
my fancies, better would it have been by far had I never analyzed 
them at all; left inside treir dark envelope of crime, their strange- 
ness would doubtless affright me, but they would at least titillate 
me; whereas the light my philosophy sheds upon them renders them 
so comprehensible, so simple, that they have ceased altogether to 
have any effect upon me.” 

“It is the downtredden, the unlucky, the helpless,” said I, 
“one should whenever possible make the targets of one’s wicked- 
ness; the tears you wring from indigence have a pungency which 
very potently stimulates the nervous humours, etc.” 

“Why, ’tis a happy coincidence,” said the Princess, suddenly 
brightening, “for the splendid little scheme I have lately had in 
mind is perfectly in the spirit of your suggestion: my intention is, 
on the same day, at the same hour, to send all the hospitals in 
Rome, all the city’s poorhouses, all the orphans’ homes, all the 
public schools up in smoke; and not only is this excellent plan 
agreeable to my lewd mischievousness, it will also profit my greed. 


Juliette & 711 


From an entirely trustworthy individual I have the offer of one | 
hundred thousand crowns to be mine once the catastrophe has 
taken place: it will prepare the ground for a project of his own and 
from which he will gain a fortune in gold, and glory besides.” 

“T marvel that you hesitate.” 

“Oh, the vestiges of a prejudice... . This horror, do you real- 
ize, will cost the lives of a good three hundred thousand human 
beings.” 

“I dare say; but does it matter? You will discharge, Olympia, 
you will rescue your senses from the torpor where they are presently 
becalmed; yours shall be the delicious moments you are about to 
taste, as for the rest, eh, it is of no concern to you; is hesitation 
philosophically warranted? Why, my sweet, I had no idea matters 
stood so ill with you. When shall you wake up? When are you going 
to understand that all this world abounds in is nought but game 
meant for our pleasures; that every last one of these creatures you 
see waiting about is Nature’s gift to us, that ’tis only through 
dallying destructively with them, with the greatest possible number 
of them, that we fulfill Nature’s expectations of us? Come, an end 
to this sulking in your tent, up, Olympia, great deeds call to you. 
Since you are in the midst of unburdening yourself, this is perhaps 
the proper moment to tell me whether you have not perpetrated 
some other crime than those you have avowed to me already: if I 
am to advise you well I must know you thoroughly, so speak freely 
if there are any pertinent facts whereof I ought to have intelli- 
gence.” 

‘Very well then,” said Princess Borghese, “I am guilty of a 
child-murder; I feel the need to recount it to you. When twelve 
years of age I gave birth to a daughter more beautiful than any- 
thing you can imagine. It was when she had grown to be ten that 
I became wild about her. My authority over her, her candor, her 
guilelessness, her innocence, all this furnished me the means to 
satisfy myself. We frigged each other. Two years of that and she 
began to pall on me. My penchants, reinforced by satiety, soon 
spelled out her fate; only the thought of her destruction moistened 
my cunt now. I had just buried my husband; of near relatives there 
were none left, nobody who could call me to account for my child.

I publish the rumor she has been carried off by sickness and clap 
her into the tower of a castle I have by the seaside, and which more 
resembles a fortress than an abode for decent and well-intentioned 
folk; I left her to languish six months in this reclusion, behind those 
stone walls and iron bars. Stripping people of their liberty amuses 
me, I like holding captives; I know that while they are incarcerated 
my victims suffer: this perfidious idea excites me, I should love to 
be able to maintain entire nations in this cruel situation,” 

“I arrive at my castle—with you may imagine what fell de- 
signs. In my entourage were two paid queans and a young maiden, 
my child’s playmate, her dearest friend. After a delicious dinner, 
thorough and artful masturbations brought my rage to a pitch and 
readied me for my crime. Finally, I climb the stairs to the tower, 
alone, and spend a preliminary two hours in that raving, in that 
peculiar delirium, that divine incoherence whereinto lust plunges 
us drunkenly and which it is so pleasant to hazard with a person 
who is never again to see the light of day. I doubt, my love, 
whether I could well render to you the things I said, the things I 
did. .. . I behaved like cne gone stark mad: this was my first open 
sacrifice of a victim. Hitherto I had acted covertly, employed 
stealth, and my opportunities to enjoy the effects of my crime had 
been meager; this however was outright assassination, a premedi- 
tated murder, a horror, an execrable infanticide—a prank after our 
own taste, save only that into it there was not incorporated that 
lewd ingredient you have since taught me to blend into such deeds. 
Here blind hatred had a greater share than lucid calculation, fury 
a greater share than voluptuousness. Incredibly animated, I was 
perhaps about to leap tiger-like upon my victim when a fiendish 
idea entered my crazed brain and made me pause. . . . This friend 
of my daughter’s . . . this creature she adored and whom I had 
used as I had used her, I struck upon the idea of killing her first. 
Thus, I said to myself, thus shall I have the further pleasure of 
enjoying my daughter’s reaction to the sight of her dead companion, 
I rush out to arrange the confrontation. 


17 The sustained pleasure it affords is uniquely responsible for the custom the 
Asiatics have of keeping women under lock and key: you'll not suppose that jealousy 
is at the root of this practice? Can jealousy exist in the heart of a man who has two 
or three hundred wives?

“Then, returning to fetch my daughter, ‘Come,’ said I, ‘I am 
going to show you your very best friend.’ 

‘““‘Oh, Mother, where are you leading me? These dark tunnels. 

. And what is Marcelle doing in this dreadful place?” 

‘You shall see, Agnes.’ 

mi opena door. This new dungeon i into which I drag my child 
is draped in black. Marcelle’s head was hanging from the ceiling; 
propped upright, sitting in a negligent attitude upon a bench, her 
naked body was just beneath the head, six inches of emptiness 
separated the one from the other; one of her arms, lopped off at 
the shoulder, was wrapped like a girdle around her waist, and three 
daggers were driven into her heart. Agnes stared at the spectacle, 
and shuddered. Her distress was extreme, but she did not give way 
before it; the color drained from her face, a gray wave of grief 
replaced it. Yet another moment did she gaze upon this horror; 
then, slowly turning her lovely eyes toward me, she asked: ‘Is it you 
who have done this?” 

“J, all by myself.’ 

‘‘ ‘What wrong did the poor girl ever do you?’ 

‘None, to my knowledge. Thinkst thou one must have pre- 
texts to commit a crime? Shall I need any when a little while from 
now I butcher thee?’ 

“Upon hearing those words Agnes fell into a swoon, and ab- 
sorbed in thought there did I tarry between my two victims, one 
smitten already by the scythe of death, the other shortly to feel its 
edge. 

“Oh, my friend,” continued the Princess, much moved by the 
story she was telling, “how puissant are these pleasures! They assail 
the frame as a tempest and huge waves try a ship at sea, and by 
those blows one is nigh to overwhelmed. These pleasures, ah. . . 
how fascinating are their details, how they intoxicate. But it cannot 
be described; it must be experienced. There, all alone with two 
victims, to do everything you fancy, anything; to act, to riot, to 
rant at your ease, without interference from anybody, without any- 
body hearing you; to know that twenty feet of earth ensure the 
security of your imagination’s disorders; to say to yourself, here is 
an object Nature surrenders into my hands to do with absolutely 
whatever I please, I can smash it, I can burn it, I can maim it, I 


714 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


can dismantle it, I can torment it, I can fondle and annihilate it as 
I like, it is mine, nothing can deprive me of it, nothing save it from 
its fate—ah, Juliette, what happiness, what joy. And in such condi- 
tions what do we not attempt... . 

‘And then I left off my brooding and sprang upon Agnes. She 
was nude, unconscious, utterly defenseless. .. . So mighty was my 
trouble that my frantic wrath encompassed, it defined, all that was 
alive in me. Oh, Juliette, I satisfied myself; and after three hours 
of the most various tortures, the most hideous and merciless, I 
restored to the elements an inert mass which had received life in 
my womb only in order to become the toy of my rage and my 
viciousness.”” 

‘And then you discharged,” I ventured. 

“No,” Olympia replied. “No, in those days, I say, I had still 
to establish the connection between lewdness and crime; a veil 
obscured my vision, you were the one who snatched it away... . 
Before we met I used to act mechanically; but if today I were to 
institute such a scene, how much more intelligently I would proceed. 
. .. But alas, that delicious crime cannot be repeated. I have no 
daughter left.” 

The villainy behincl that regret, the debauches which had oc- 
cupied us earlier in the clay, the conversation we had just now had, 
the excesses we had indulged in at table, everything drove us head- 
long into each other’s ernbrace. But too overwrought, too libertine 
to suffice unto ourselves, we must have auxiliaries, and Olympia 
summoned her women. Several more ecstatic hours were devoted to 
pleasure. Upon that god’s altars we immolated a young victim, she 
was as fair as the day. ] requested Princess Borghese to treat her 
just as she had done her daughter; whence there resulted unspeak- 
able horrors, and when we parted ’twas for the purpose of concert- 
ing others. 


But prodigious as Madame Borghese’s libertinage might be, 
- still it was not enough to make me forget the pure pleasures I was 
yet bent on tasting with sweet Honorine. Several days after our 
first adventure together I went to see her again. The Duchess 
greeted me more cordially than ever, we embraced delightedly and 


Juliette & 715 


our conversation soon came around to the joys we had recently 
given each other: evoking them shortly moved us to engage anew 
in the activities whence they had derived, as will regularly happen 
when a pair of women hold such parley. The weather that day was 
sultry; we two were alone in a lovely boudoir, stretched indolently 
side by side upon a broad divan; what earthly excuse could we have 
had for delaying the sacrifice to a god whose altars were ready 
dressed and beckoning impatiently ? Coy Honorine’s defenses were 
swiftly overrun and a moment later, in quivering surrender, she 
offered me all her desire-swollen charms. How beautiful the creature 
was to behold . . . a thousand times daintier than Olympia, fresher, 
more youthful than she, artless, embellished by modesty’s graces, 
why was it she pleased me not so much withal ? Indescribable allure- 
ments of obscenity, lewdness’ fascination, divine amenities of de- 
bauchery, has Nature then invested in you some unique power to 
please abstractly? To sense your incredible sway, O crime, is to 
recognize your sovereign grandeur and to bow in acknowledgment 
before your absolute rights. .. . 

This time I had brought paraphernalia for aping the sex in 
whose qualities we were both naturally lacking. We girded on 
dildoes and fell to dallying now as lover and mistress, now as 
master and mate, now in the style of bardash and tribade, we 
coupled in every imaginable manner. But ever the novice, willing 
to follow but incapable of taking the lead, Honorine displayed 
modesty and timidity where debauchery and lusty zeal were to be 
desired; and when all was told, from her I obtained not a sixth of 
the pleasure Borghese would have given me in like circumstances. 
Had she been completely untried, the idea of corrupting her might 
have become the food to imagination libertinage ordinarily nour- 
ishes; but such was not the case, for Honorine, though yet a prude 
and pathetically inept, had nonetheless lived a little in this world, 
and ’twas during one of those moments of mutual abandon when 
avowals add a further dimension to pleasure that the heavenly 
Duchess related the anecdote you are now to hear. 

“Soon after my marriage to the Duke—I was sixteen years old 
at the time,” said she, “I contracted a close friendship with the 
Marquise Salvati, a woman twice my age, dreadfully dissolute, and 
who had always contrived to mask her scandalous conduct behind 


716 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


eminently virtuous appearances. Libertine, godless, eccentric in her 
tastes, pretty as an angel, Salvati enjoyed doing everything whence 
enjoyment can possibly be reaped; among her fondest practices was 
the seduction of newly-wed young women whom she would enlist 
to be her partners in her furtive revels. So it was the rascal took an 
interest in me. Her air of reserve, her hypocritical and cunning 
speech, her connections, a prior acquaintance with my mother, it 
was by these means she established relations with me, they very 
soon turned into a liaison of an intimate kind, for we were at the 
stage of reciprocal frigyeries inside a week. The scene transpired in 
villeggiatura, at the country residence of Cardinal Orsini near 
Tivoli, where we met. Our husbands were with us. Mine was no 
great hindrance to me: elderly and, to judge from my experience 
with him up until then, cold, seeming to have married me for my 
wealth alone, I had little care for Grillo in the pursuit of my 
pleasures. The Marquise’s husband however, although very liber- 
tine, did not leave her to spoil in such complete idleness; his de- 
mands upon her were both fatiguing and unusual, their fulfillment 
required that she lie the whole of every night in his bedchamber, 
which did not facilitate our secret little doings. We made up for 
our nighttime estrangement during the day, when we would wander 
off together in the splendid woodlands of Orsini’s vast estate, and 
those promenades were the occasions upon which the Marquise 
toiled over my mind and soul, interspersing her lessons with the 
sweetest pleasures of feminine debauchery. 

“ “For passing life agreeably it is not a lover we need,’ she 
would urge, ‘from out of our embraces he goes forth indiscreet or 
perfidious. The habit wz fall into of being loved causes us to take 
on a new lover, and for a dozen unpleasant nights we find ourselves 
condemned before the public for a lifetime. Not that a spotless 
reputation is anything of great value,’ the Marquise hastened to 
add, ‘but when one can preserve it and double one’s pleasures 
besides, you will agree, I should fancy, eat the means leading to 
such results can only be the best.’ 

“Why yes, indeed.’ 

“Then those are the means we shall adopt, my angel; three 
days from now we return to town and once we are back I shall re- 
veal to you the secret formula for happiness.’ 


Juliette & 717 


““*The situation is this,’ said Salvati the day after we had 
regained Rome. ‘We are four. You will, if you wish, make the fifth. 
At our orders we have a reliable and resourceful woman of sixty 
years, the proprietress of a secluded house and very suitably ap- 
pointed. We notify her, she straightway assembles in her house 
everything our lust can need, whether in male form or female, and 
of all this we make whatever use we wish and in completest security ; 
what do you think of this arrangement ?” 

“Tt cannot be denied, Juliette,” Madame Grillo continued, 

“youthful and neglected by my husband, I was only too ready to 
listen to that temptress’ offers. I assured her I would be with her 
on the very next excursion to that house, but insisted that she 
promise me I would encounter no men there. 

‘As you know, my husband has virtually no dealings with me 
at all, said I, ‘which is a further reason he would be quick to 
remark damages I were to do his honor.’ 

“AIL I asked, the Marquise promised, and we set forth. Seeing 
myself being conveyed across the Tiber and into the farthermost 
districts of the city, I felt a certain alarm; but contained it; we 
arrived. Before us stood a large and well-appearing house, but 
solitary, wrapped in silence and shadow, quite as was required by 
the mysteries we were about to celebrate. 

“We were to traverse several suites of rooms before seeing 
a soul; and then, in a large antechamber, we were met by the 
mistress of the place. And now I was surprised by a sudden altering 
in the Marquise’s tone: that decency, that show of sweetness and 
virtue gave way to language at which the lowest prostitute would 
have blushed. 

“* ‘What's in the larder ?’ she asked. 

“ ‘Awaiting the young lady you have brought I have four 
charming creatures,’ the old woman told us, ‘for your instructions 
were that I prepare her women only.’ 

“And for me what have you got ready? 

““*Two fine Swiss Guards, strapping lads capable of giving it 
to you hard straight through till tomorrow.’ 

‘This whore,’ said the Marquise, and it was to me she was 
referring, ‘would do better to join me in’a meal of good beef 
instead of going off to fill up on gruel—but she’s free to feed as she 


718 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


chooses. Say now.’ Salvati went on, ‘our sisters, are they here yet?” 

““‘Only one has appeared so far,’ replied the directress of the 
house. ‘Elmire.’ 

“These ladies, it was explained to me, adopted false names for 
the sake of additional secrecy, and thereupon it was decided mine 
would be Rose. 

‘“ ‘What is Elmire about ?’ 

“« ‘She is with the four girls I have assigned to milady.’ 

“At this I cast an embarrassed glance at the Marquise. 

“*Poor silly,’ she chided me, ‘this is no place for shyness, we 
are a community and when we indulge in similar activities we act 
in concert, each within view of the other. Those who frolic with 
women group together, those who use men congregate likewise.’ 

“But I have no idea who this person might be,’ I protested. 

““*Never fear, youll get to know her from frigging yourself 
in her company, there’s no better way to strike up acquaintance. 
Well now, which shall it be? Here in this room to the left are men, 
over there to the right, women; hurry up, make your choice and 
I'll make the introductions.’ 

“I was much troutled; I was violently eager for some men. 
But did I dare expose myself to all the risks that could result from 
my rashness? On the other hand, a new acquaintance spelled possi- 
ble danger—who might this unknown woman prove to be? Would 
she be discreet? Would not her presence fairly paralyze me? Such 
were my doubts and perplexity that I stood a while not knowing 
which way to turn. 

““*Make up your mind, little bapeeiens said Salvati, catching 
me roughly by the arm, ‘I have better things to do here than waste 
precious time.’ 

“Very well,’ said I, heaving a sigh, ‘I'll go in with the women.’ 

“The directress rapped on the door. 

‘“‘One moment,’ replied a muffled voice from within. 

‘“‘A few minutes later the door was opened by a young girl and 
we entered. 

“The Marquise’s companion, she whom we designated as 
Elmire, was yet a beautiful woman at forty-five and after anxiously 
scanning her face I decided we were perfect strangers. But great 
heaven, in what disorder I found her! Setting out to paint the 


Juliette 719 


effigy of license and impurity one would have had but to copy what 
was already drawn in this wild creature’s visage. She was sprawled 
stark naked upon an ottoman, her thighs flung apart; two girls lay 
about her, upon cushions, and in the same indecent attitude. Her 
face was flushed, her glittering eyes stared fixedly, her long tresses 
floated loose over her degraded breast, spittle dribbled from her 
mouth. The two or three words she mumbled suggested she might 
be drunk; and from the untidiness in the room, the litter of glasses 
and bottles, I concluded that such indeed she must be. 

‘Fuck,’ she grunted as she twitched beneath her own caresses, 
‘I was on the verge of a squirt when you knocked, that’s why I made 
you wait; who’s this little whore ?’ 

“A sister,’ Salvati replied, ‘a tribade of your own stripe here 
for some friggery.’ 

‘She can make herself at home,’ said the seasoned Sappho, 
‘fingers, mouths, dildoes, cunts, they are all here to be used. But 
first let me give her a wee kiss, come, there’s a pretty little darling.’ 

‘And on the instant, I am being kissed, tongued, probed, it all 
happens in a trice. 

‘I leave her to you,’ the Marquise told her friend, ‘they’re 
waiting for me on the other side of the hall. Take good care of 
Rose, she has lots of things to learn.’ And the next instant she 
was gone. 

“The door is no sooner shut behind her than the four girls 
spring upon me and in the twinkle of an eye have me as naked as 
themselves. I shall not describe what those women did to me, it 
would be too afflicting to my modesty; I need merely say that 
libertinage and impudence were carried to the extreme. The middle- 
aged lady amused herself with me, amused herself in front of me; 
when my turn came I did with her and with each of the four girls 
every last thing that entered my head: Elmire took pleasure sur- 
prising me, teasing me, goading me on, shocking me, employing 
the most inconceivable and lewdest artifices. One might truthfully 
say that her greatest charm consisted in presenting lust to me 
under its filthiest shapes and most peculiar colors in order to con- 
taminate my mind and corrupt my heart. Day came at long last, 
the Marquise reappeared, we dressed and promptly returned each 
to her house in the fervent hope that nothing would dissuade our 


720 ch THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


husbands from continuing in the belief that their wives had spent 
the evening at a ball; and their Lordships never doubted but that 
this was the truth. Cheered by this first success, I allowed myself 
to be led a second time to that dreadful establishment; seduced by 
the pernicious Marquise, I very shortly turned from women to 
men and my misbehavior was without equal or precedent. Remorse 
finally fastened upon my soul; virtue cried out to me and I re- 
turned gratefully into i:s fold; I vowed to live as befits an honest 
woman and as such would I still be living were it not for you, 
whose graces and talen:s and adorableness and beauty must cause 
all the frail oaths that shall ever be foolishly sworn to goodness 
to shatter into pieces upon the altars of Love.” 

“Charming woman,” said I to the Duchess, “a virtuous vow, 
why, pronounced by you ’tis an extravagance for which Nature 
is bound to chasten you; ’tis not for honest living she created us, 
my dear, but for fucking; we outrage her by defying her purposes 
and when we refuse to fuck we are in open rebellion against her 
will. If that delicious house still exists I beseech you to return to it; 
never am I envious of my friends’ pleasures, I ask no more than 
permission to share or bzhold them.” 

‘“‘No, the woman who ran that house sold it a year or so ago 
and has left Rome,” Honorine said, ‘‘but there are other means for 
obtaining pleasure.” 

“And why not exploit them ?” 

“TI feel less and less free, my husband is taking a constantly 
growing interest in me, he is becoming jealous; I am even afraid 
he has begun to suspect there is something between you and me.” 

“Such a man must be got rid of.” 

“Got rid of !” 

“Bah, putoutof the way.” 

“Why, you make me shudder !” 

“You have no cause to shudder. Men are put out of the way 
and got properly rid of every day. The foremost of Nature’s laws 
is to disencumber ourselves of whatever displeases us; husband- 
murder is an imagined crime I myself have perpetrated without 
the slightest hesitation or regret; we must think of ourselves in 
this world, mobody else counts. Fundamentally and absolutely 
isolated from all other beings, just as we should approach only 


Juliette 2 721 


those which please us, so should we be equally careful to send on 
their way those which are distasteful to us. Between the existence 
of a person I find troublesome and my own interests there can be 
no common measure. What! I’d be such an enemy of my own well- 
being as to prolong the life of him who causes me suffering? I’d 
so violently contradict the commands of Nature as not to put an 
end tothe life of him who deliberately ruins all the felicity of mine? 
Moral and political murders shall be tolerated, nay, justified, and 
personal murders disconsidered! It is not only unfair, it is pre- 
posterous. Honorine, such prejudices are grotesquely unbecoming, 
you should be above them. He who intends to be happy on earth 
must without any scruple fling aside everything, absolutely every- 
thing that stands in his path, he must embrace everything that 
serves or flatters his passions. . .. You lack the means? I can provide 
them.” 

‘What horrors do you speak!”’ cried the Duchess. “I do not 
love Signor Grillo, I shall not pretend the contrary; but I respect 
him; he is my youth’s protector; his jealousy is my safeguard, for 
otherwise, if unrestrained, I would rush headlong into the pitfalls 
toward which it is certain that libertinage would lead me—” 

“Child, you talk nonsense!” ] interrupted, ‘“‘all sophistry and 
weakness. Are you trying to tell me that because somebody prevents 
you from seizing the joys of life Nature holds out to you, you ought, 
instead of putting a halt to his interference, to double the weight 
of the shackles he loads upon you? Ah, Honorine, stand fearlessly 
up, break those humiliating chains. The handiwork of fashion and 
egotistical policy, what is there sacred about them, tell me? Scorn 
them, jeer at them, curse them, spit upon them if you like, they 
merit no better. In this world, a pretty woman should have no god 
other than pleasure; no physical obligation other than to receive 
our homage in return for the delight she gives us; no virtue other 
than that of fucking; no moral duty other than to observe the 
imperious law of her desires. First of all, you must get yourself 
a child, never mind who sires it on you, you need issue if you are to 
secure control over your husband’s fortune. That once accom- 
plished, we feed the funny fellow a well-spiced cup of consommé 
and afterward the two of us, you and I, go for a gay wallow in the 
slime pit of the most atrocious, the most abominable pleasure— 


722 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


pleasure of the most atrocious, the most abominable sort because that 
is the most delectable sort which has been made for your enjoyment 
and which you have been made to enjoy, atrocious and abominable 
pleasure whereof you cannot deprive yourself without someday 
being called to answer for it before the judgment seat of Reason 
and of Nature.” 

That prudish spirit proved stubbornly unresponsive to my 
teachings; this was perhaps the only woman I had ever failed to 
corrupt. The moment came when I lost patience and abandoned my 
efforts; that was the moment I took the resolve to destroy her. 

The question now was simply of disposing my guns to best 
advantage; I went to consult Borghese. 

“I thought you were in love with the Duchess,” Olympia 
teased. 

“What an idea, I ir. love! My heart has always been a stranger 
to puerile sentiments: [| have amused myself with that woman, 
done everything humanly possible to guide her into crime, she 
refuses to be led, it’s a wretched fool I intend at present to send 
to her doom.” 

“T perfectly understand. It should not be difficult.” 

“No, it should not be, except that I want her husband to 
perish with her; I had projected his death, I wanted to put the 
dagger into his wife’s hand and have her wield it against him— 
must the idiot’s refusal cost me a victim ?”’ 

“Rascal!” 

“Both of them hav: to be killed.” 

“The idea pleases me,” said Borghese, “the act would amuse 
me as much as you; bring them to my country house and we shall 
see what we can do.” 

Arrangements are made for the party, Borghese and I har- 
monize our plans. I sha] not bother you with the details but move 
directly to the outcome. 

Along with us we had taken a young man of the Princess’ 
acquaintance. Quite as seductive as he was comely, no less clever 
than witty, our Dolni, twenty years old, used to fuck us fairly 
frequently, and knowledge of his mind and parts had induced us 
to select him for the piece of wickedness we were meditating. From 


Juliette & 723 


the very first moment, Dolni set to work and with great art aroused 
the passions of Honorine and the jealous suspicions of her husband. 
The deeply disturbed Grillo turned to me in quest of a friendly 
ear and poured out all! his fears; these, as you may imagine, I did 
rather more to increase than allay. 

“My good Duke,” said I to that fool, “I am greatly sur- 
prised that you have been so slow to notice your wife’s behavior. 
I or indeed any other could have enlightened you long ago, but one 
is sometimes reluctant to become the bearer of evil tidings; you 
seemed so well protected by your blindness, it is so cruel to blast 
such illusions; I held my peace. Dolni’s purpose for being here is 
the Duchess’ presence, as everybody is well aware; why, I had 
hardly been overnight in Rome when I heard of their affair.” 

‘“‘Then it is an affair ?” 

“To put it mildly, my Lord. But I see that you still entertain 
doubts, and they can be more painful than the naked truth itself. 
It is in the morning or while you are out taking a walk that Dolni 
ordinarily dishonors your bed: catch the two culprits in the act 
tomorrow, and for your honor’s sake be not laggardly in revenging 
yourself for so brazen an affront.” 

“You will aid me, Madame?” 

“In so far as I am able to. A word of advice: beware of 
speaking of this to the Princess: intimately connected with your 
wife, privy to her passion—it is notorious—I believe she connives 
at what is going on under her roof.” 

‘Not a word to her then. Tomorrow morning I shall be 
hidden in the dressing room adjoining the bedchamber.” 

Lest we be overseen in conversation together we separate at 
once, I having recommended ‘to the Duke that he avoid me the 
whole of that day. I seek out the Duchess and, encouraging her to 
banish all scruples in order to enjoy to the full the pleasures at 
whose mere thought the young man has already made her giddy, 
I notify her that the Duke means to go ahunting the next day, 
which will enable her to pass the entire morning in riot with Dolni. 

“Get started early, the two of you, and when you are well 
under way I'll arrive and we shall carry on as a trio.” 

My proposal fetched’ gay laughter from the Duchess, and, she 


724 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


assented to it gladly. The moment drew nigh; thinking the two 
lovers properly at grips, I bade the Duke follow me on to the 
stage. 

“So then, good sir,” said I, directing his attention to the 
frantically copulating couple, ‘is this less than you require to be 
convinced ?” 

Furious Grillo, drawn dagger in hand, hurls himself upon the 
adulterous pair. Aiding his arm, I see to it the blow falls upon his 
faithless spouse: the blade sinks deep into her flank, the Duke 
would now vent his rage upon the lover, but nimble Dolni rolls 
away, springs to his feet, scampers from the room, Grillo hot in 
his pursuit. They race clown a long corridor .. . at its farther end 
two trap doors open, one dropping the young man into an under- 
ground passage, where he is safe, the other tumbling Grillo into 
the works of a frightful machine fitted with a thousand sharp blades 
for carving to ribbons whatever is placed inside it. 

“Great God, what is this? what have I done?” cries the Duke, 
‘oh, hideous snare! LDiiabolical knaves, all your design was to 
trick me! And you, dearest wife, I was mistaken, they deceived me— 
you were seduced, at bottom you are innocent—”’ 

These last words ‘were scarce out of the Duke’s mouth when 
Borghese sent his naked and bleeding wife flying to join him in 
the pit. 

Over the open trap we lowered a grillwork, upon it we three, 
Dolni, Olympia, and I, lay down flat and peered at our captives. 
“There she is, my Lorci,” said I, “innocent no doubt and yet more 
certainly wounded by ycur treatment of her. Succor her if you dare, 
but know that in doing so your peril is great.” 

Grillo starts impulsively toward his wife; but his movement 
releases a spring, the machine starts to whirr, its many blades to 
turn, their edges slash at the two victims who in less than ten 
minutes are threshed shapeless, of them nought but blood and 
splintered bone remains. I need not describe our ecstasy, Borghese’s 
and mine, as we watched that scene; both frigged by Dolni, we 
loosed discharge after discharge, at least a dozen in all, the sight 
of that atrocity left our cunts in a state nearly as gruesome, and 
inspired our minds to a very rare degree. 

‘Come spend the day with me tomorrow,” Olympia suggested 


Juliette & 725 


when we had returned to the city, “I shall introduce you to the 
personage who has offered me a hundred thousand crowns to burn 
down all the hospitals and alms-houses in Rome. The man who is to 
attend to the lighting of the fires will be there too.” 

“What, do you still have that horror on your mind, Princess ?” 

“Certainly, Juliette. You confine your criminal activity to 
upsetting households whereas I make mine felt by at least half a 
city. Incendiary Nero is my model; I too would like to stand on my 
balcony, a lyre in my hand, and while singing gaze forth upon my 
native land become a pyre for my countrymen.” 

“Olympia, you are a monster.” 

“Oh, not so great a one as you; the base scheme that brought 
the Grillos to their end was absolutely typical of your invention, 
I'd never have dreamt up the like.” 

At Borghese Palace the next day Olympia presented her 
guests to me. “The first of these gentlemen’’—it was to the elder 
she alluded—“is Monsignor Chigi, related to that line of princes 
several of whom have occupied the Holy See; he is today at the 
head of the Roman police; the proposed fire I mentioned to you 
yesterday will benefit him, and the hundred thousand crowns fee 
he is to pay me is part of his investment in a very profitable venture. 
And here is Count Bracciani who, as Europe’s foremost physician, 
is to conduct the operation. Juliette,” Olympia added in a lowered 
tone, “both are friends of mine; I implore you to take their 
eventual requests of you into kindly consideration.” 

“You shall not be embarrassed by my behavior,” I assured 
her. 

And the Princess having given the strictest orders that we be 
left undisturbed, conversation was engaged. 

“I am having you dine,” said Olympia, “with one of the most 
famous scoundrels to come out of France in generations; she has 
been giving us Romans daily examples of very high proficiency in 
crime; her presence need not hinder you, my friends, in the forth- 
coming discussions of the one we are preparing.” 

“Truly, Madame,” said the master of the police, ‘‘you here 
qualify as crime an altogether unpretentious and certainly very com- 
prehensible act. I consider charitable institutions the most baneful 
things a large city can contain; they drain the people’s energy, they 


726 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


soften its fiber, they promote sloth; they are in every sense perni- 
cious; the needy individual is to the State as the parasite branch 
is to the peach tree: it causes it to wither, drinks its sap, and bears 
no fruit. What does the horticulturist do when he espies that 
branch? He cuts it off, and without qualms. The statesman must 
proceed likewise: one of the basic laws of Nature is that nothing 
superfluous subsist in tae world. You may be sure of it, not only 
does the shiftless beggar, always a nuisance, consume part of what 
the industrious man produces, which is already a serious matter, 
but will quickly become dangerous the moment you suspend your 
dole to him. My desire is that instead of bestowing a groat upon 
these misfortunates we concentrate our efforts upon wiping them 
out; my desire is that they be totally eliminated, extirpated; ex- 
terminated; killed, that is to say, and why make any bones about it? 
killed as one kills a breed of noxious animals. That is the first 
reason that led me to offer Princess Borghese one hundred thou- 
sand gold crowns for destroying these houses that are a blight 
upon our city. The second is that upon their sites I mean to build 
hospices for travelers, pilgrims, and the like; some buildings razed, 
others constructed in their place, don’t you see, and the revenues 
which went formerly to pay for maintaining the hospitals I now 
ask to have paid to me; and paid to me they shall be; mine as well 
shall be an annual one hundred thousand crowns rental: thus I 
sacrifice only the first year of an assured income to Madame 
Borghese, who in Count Bracciani, she tells me, has the suitable 
man for delivering Rome of these houses and for making a need 
felt for those I am ready to put up on their foundations, and for 
which I shall have no trouble obtaining the funds originally set aside 
for the hospitals.’* There are twenty-eight of these asylums in the 
city,” Chigi continued, “as well as nine conservatorios containing 
roughly eighteen hundred poor girls whom, needless to say, I in- 
clude in my proscriptions. All that must be set simultaneously 
ablaze; there will be some thirty or forty thousand good-for- 
nothings sacrificed—firstly, to the welfare of the State; secondly, 
to the pleasures of Olympia, who is going to reap a pretty penny 


18 This project was actually conceived while I was at Rome, and I alter nothing 
but the names of the actors. 


Juliette & 727 


from this affair; thirdly, to my fortune, for with what I already 
possess, I become one of Rome’s richest ecclesiastics if the plan 
goes successfully through.” 

“It would appear,” said Bracciani, ‘‘that I, who am to execute 
it, come off the most poorly; for it seems not yet to have occurred 
to you to offer me a sequin out of the great profits you are due to 
make.” 

“Chigi supposed that I would give you some of my hundred 
thousand,” Olympia said to the Count, ‘“‘he was mistaken: the sum 
is modest, once divided it amounts to twice nothing at all, and I 
feel you should demand a hundred thousand for yourself; you are 
worth that much to Monsignor, what more capable practitioner 
could he hope to find ?” 

“Softly,” said the churchman, “‘let’s hae no falling out at the 
start of an undertaking so important, it would be the way to have 
it all end very dismally and to provoke difficulties for one another. 
I grant the Count the same emoluments Madame Borghese is to 
have, I grant a further hundred thousand francs gratuity to this 
charming woman,” Chigi went on, smiling in my direction; ‘““Olym- 
pia’s friend must have a similar character and by that title alone 
deserves to be treated as an accomplice.” 

“She has all the virtues you can expect in one,” said the Prin- 
cess, ‘‘and I guarantee she will not disappoint you. The question of 
remunerations may be considered settled; in behalf of my friends I 
accept your offers; let us now bend our thoughts to success.” 

“T shall obtain it,” said Bracciani, ‘‘and it shall be entire: 
there shall not escape a single one of the victims Chigi’s profound 
statecraft, or rather his voluptuous wickedness, dooms to die.” 

“Upon what henceforth shall Roman doctors be able to ex- 
periment, I wonder?” 

“As Juliette implies, it is very certain,” Olympia observed, 
‘that almost all of them have long been in the habit of trying out 
their remedies upon these poorer patients whose disappearance will 
pose a problem to the profession. I am reminded,” she added, “of 
what young Iberti, my personal doctor, said to me only the other 
day upon arriving at my bedside fresh from one of those experi- 
ments. ‘What concern to the State is the existence of the vile beings 
that ordinarily crowd those dens?’ he said in response to the look of 


728 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


disapproval I assumed in order to find out how he would justify 
himself; ‘you would be doing society an enormous disservice by not 
permitting us medical artists to test our talents upon society’s dis- 
honoring dregs. These inave their use; Nature, in making them weak 
and defenseless, indicates what it is to be, and to refrain from so 
using them is to flout ‘Nature’s instructions.’ ‘But,’ said I, depart- 
ing a little from the central issue, ‘when, in a different case, some 
sordid interest leads a man distinguished by wealth or by position 
to seize the favorable opportunity afforded by a person’s illness to 
commit a crime against that person, and when this man invites 
a doctor to hasten the patient’s last moments, is it a grave fault for 
the doctor to accept the proposition ?” 

“““Great heavens, no,’ my young Aesculapius replied, ‘pro- 
vided he is well paid he has no real choice but to accept. Doing the 
deed, he has nothing to fear from his accomplice, neither does his 
accomplice have anything to fear from him: both have everything 
to gain from guarding their secret. Refusing to do the deed would 
get the doctor nowher2, for he could hardly boast of having de- 
clined a proposition which is not of the kind that is made to an 
honest man: from a refusal he would thus extract nothing but 
solitary and intellectual pleasure much inferior to that which the 
offered sum would procure him. And even were he to proclaim that 
to such a proposition he had said no, he’d not be praised for it; 
but only told he had done his duty. And as for those who do it there 
is never any reward, needless to go to the bother of chasing 
empty applause. Comparing what, apart from that applause, he 
is to gain from acceptance or refusal, he discovers that in electing 
the latter alternative he may either say nothing of the proposition 
and all alone reap the meager enjoyments that having a good 
opinion of oneself provides to fools, or create a stir and thereby 
doom his accomplice—and what does he gain from dooming the 
accomplice rather than the patient ?—in order to obtain the tawdry 
and barren satisfaction of having it said he has done his duty. Weigh 
it up: a futile pleasure as against the sum offered him to shorten 
the patient’s life: what responsible man could conceivably hesitate 
an instant? To the sane physician only one course is open: bargain 


for a high price, then kill and keep his mouth shut.’ 


Juliette & 729 


‘Those were the words, those the views of Iberti, the prettiest, 
the wittiest, the most engaging doctor in Rome” and you will 
readily understand how little difficulty he had convincing me. But 
to return to the business before us,” Olympia continued; ‘‘are you 
sure of the operation, Bracciani? Is there not the danger that the 
perfidious efforts of rescuers might ruin the effects we are striving 
for? Humane impulses, as much to be dreaded as loathed, and 
capable of spoiling many a fair crime—dare we suppose that they 
will not move a certain number of people to rush to the aid of our 
victims ?”’ 

“TI expect this,” said the Count. “I take up my position atop 
a high hill in the middle of Rome. From there I launch invisible 
bombs, thirty-seven of them, one for each of the thirty-seven 
asylums ; they land in barrage. Other projectiles follow at carefully 
spaced intervals: rescuers flock to a new burning area after having 
mastered the flames in a former one, which I set promptly back on 
fire.” 

“In this way, Count, you could have an entire city ablaze.” 

“Exactly,” said the physician, “and our present undertaking, 
limited in scope though it be, may very well cause half the popula- 
tion of Rome to perish.” 

“Some of the hospitals are located in extremely poor quarters 
of the city,” said Chigi, “those quarters shall be destroyed in- 
fallibly.” 

“Such considerations do not make you pause?” Olympia 
wondered. ; 

‘Not for one instant, Madame,” Chigi and the Count replied 
as one.man. 

“These gentlemen seem to have firmly made up their minds,” 
I observed to the Princess, “and my guess would be that the crime 
they are about to commit is to them something of slight im- 
portance.” 

‘There is nothing of crime in our project,” Chigi explained. 

18 Let me render thee this homage, charming and never to be forgotten friend. 
Thy name is the only one I have been unable to take it upon myself to disguise in 
these memoirs. Thou wert ever the philosopher, that is thy role in my writings and 


thou must surely forgive me for my eagerness to make thy identity known to the 
whole world. 


730 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“All our errors under the chapter of ethics come from the absurd- 
ity of our ideas touching good and evil. 

“If we fully apprehended the indifference of all our actions, 
were we properly persuaded that those we call just are anything 
but that in the eyes of Nature, and that those we characterize as 
iniquitous are perhaps, in her view, the most perfect measure of 
reason and equity, for a certainty we would make far fewer mis- 
calculations. But childhood prejudices lead us astray and will never 
cease inducing us into error so long as we have the weakness to 
listen to them. It does indeed seem that the lamp of reason does 
not begin to enlighten us until such time as we are no longer able 
to profit from its rays, and not before stupidity has been added to 
stupidity that we arrive at the discovery of the source of all that 
ignorance has caused us to commit. We almost always employ the 
laws of our government as our compass for determining right and 
wrong, just and injust. The law, we say, prohibits doing this or 
that, this or that is hence unjust; than this manner of judging 
none is more deceiving, vor the law is oriented toward the general 
interest; now, nothing is at a farther remove from the general 
interest than individual interest, its very opposite; hence, noth- 
ing less just than the law which sacrifices all individual interests 
to the general interest. But, they maintain, man wishes to live 
in society; he must therefore forego a portion of his private 
good for the sake of public good. Very well; but how ever could 
he have made such a )act without being sure of receiving at 
least as much as he gives? Now, he extracts nothing from the 
pact he makes when consenting to the law; for you put him 
far more heavily to coritribution than you satisfy him, and for 
every occasion upon which the law protects him there are a 
thousand others when it restricts him; he hence ought not to have 
consented to the law, or ought to have insisted that it be made 
infinitely more lenient. Laws have served only to delay the annihila- 
tion of prejudices, to lengthen our term of shameful bondage to 
error; law is a bridle man imposed upon man when he saw with 
what ease man freed himself of other bridles, hence a makeshift— 
to answer what purpose? There are punishments for the guilty, 
true enough; in them I see cruelties but not a means to make men 
better, and that it seems t:o me is the end to which one should have 


Juliette & 731 


labored. Punishments, aye—and there’s nothing easier to escape, 
this certitude encourages the emancipated and venturesome spirit. 
Ah, let it be understood once and for all, laws are nothing but futile 
and dangerous; their sole effect is to multiply crimes or to cause 
them to be committed in safety by compelling the criminal to act 
in secrecy. But for laws and religion there is no imagining the degree 
of grandeur and glory human knowledge would have attained today ; 
no imagining how these infamous curbs have retarded progress; 
that is our single debt to them. Priests dare inveigh against the 
passions; lawyers dare fetter them with laws. But merely compare 
the ones and the others; see which, passions or laws, have done 
mankind the more good. Who doubts, as Helvétius proclaims, that 
the passions are in morals precisely what motion is in physics? 
Tis to strong passions alone invention and artistic wonders are 
due; the passions should be regarded, the same author goes on to 
say, as the fertilizing germ of the mind and the puissant spring 
to great deeds. Those individuals who are not motivated by strong 
passions are mediocre beings. Only great passions will ever be able 
to produce great men; when passion falters decrepitude enters in, 
when it is absent stupidity prevails. These fundamentals established, 
I ask how laws that inhibit the passions.can be anything but pro- 
foundly and in every sense dangerous. In the history of any country 
compare the periods of anarchy with those during which order was 
most vigorously maintained by the most vigorously enforced laws, 
and recognize that only at moments when the laws were held in 
contempt do stupendous actions occur. Law resumes its despotic 
sway and a fatal lethargy is seen to invade the spirits of men; 
though vice ceases to be noticeable, the disappearance of all virtue 
is yet more conspicuous: the inner workings rust and revolutions 
begin to breed.” 

“But,” Olympia interrupted, ‘‘you wish to do away with all 
laws in an empire ?” 

“No. Restored to a state of Nature, mankind, I afirm, would 
be happier than it can possibly be under the absurd yoke of law. 
I am opposed to man’s renunciation of a single ounce of his capaci- 
ties. He has no need of laws for his self-protection; in him Nature 
put the necessary instincts and energy for that; taking the law into 
his own hands he will always obtain a speedier, purer, more in- 


732 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


cisive, stronger-brewed justice than anything to be had in a cowt- 
room, for his act of personal justice will be determined by his 
personal interest and the hurt he has personally sustained, whereas 
the laws of a people are never other than the mass and the result 
of the interests of all the lawmakers who cooperate in erecting 
those laws.” 

‘But without the laws you will be oppressed.” 

“That matters not to me if I have the right to repay oppression 
in kind: I prefer to be oppressed by a neighbor whom I can oppress 
in my turn than to be oppressed by the law before which I am help- 
less. My neighbor’s passions are infinitely less to be dreaded than 
the law’s injustice, for zhe passions of that neighbor are held at 
bay by mine, nothing checks the injustices of the law, against the 
law there is no reprisal to be taken, no recourse to be had. 
All the defects in humans belong to Nature; accordingly, man can 
have no better laws thar. those of Nature; no man has the right to 
repress in him what Nature put there. Nature has elaborated no 
statutes, instituted no code; her single law is writ deep in every 
man’s heart: it is to satisfy himself, to deny his passions nothing, 
and this regardless of the cost to others. Think not to hinder this 
universal law’s impulsions whatever their effects may be; you have 
no right to curb them; let this be the concern of him they outrage; 
if strong, he will know how to react. The men who thought that 
from their necessity to join together was derived a necessity for 
framing laws to themselves fell into heaviest error; they had no 
more need of laws gathered in society than dwelling alone in the 
forest. A universal glaive of justice is of no purpose; everybody 
naturally possesses one of his own.” 

“But not everyone will wield it appropriately, and iniquity 
will beome general—” 

‘Impossible. Never will Tom be unjust toward Dick when he 
knows Dick can retaliate instantly; but it’s a very unjust Tom you 
have as soon as he discovers he has nothing to fear except laws 
that he can elude or from which he can make himself exempt. I go 
farther, I grant you that without laws the sum of crime increases, 
that without laws the world turns into one great volcano belching 
forth an uninterrupted spew of execrable crimes; and I tell you this 
situation is preferable, far preferable to what we have at present. 


Juliette & 733 


I envisage a perpetual outpouring of conflict, injury, and aggres- 
sion; it is nothing beside what takes place under the rule of law, | 
for the law often smites the innocent, and to the total of victims 
produced by the criminal must be added the mass of those pro-— 
duced by legal miscarriage and iniquity: give us anarchy and we will — 
have these victims the less. Ta be sure, we will have those crime 
sacrifices; but the ravages of the law will be a thing of the past. 
Invested with the right to do his own revenging, the oppressed 
man will proceed with speed, diligence, economy, and certitude to 
punish his oppressor and none other.” 

“However, opening the door to the arbitrary, anarchy is 
necessarily the cruel image of despotism—” 

‘Another error; ’tis the abuse of the law that leads to despo- 
tism; the despot is he who creates the law, who bids it speak or be 
still, who uses it to serve his own interests. Deprive the despot of 
this means for abuse and there’s an end to tyranny. There has 
never been a tyrant who failed to-raise laws for props in the exercise 
of his cruelties; if everywhere human rights shall be well enough 
distributed to enable each man to avenge the wrongs done him, no 
despot shall arise, for he would be overthrown the moment he at- 
tempted to make his first victim. Never are tyrants born of anarchy, 
you see them flourish only behind the screen of the law or attain 
supremacy by means of it, basing their authority upon law. Vivious- 
ness thus reigns under the rule of law; thus, lawful rule is inferior 
to anarchy: the greatest proof whereof is the government’s obliga- 
tion to plunge the State into anarchy whenever it wishes to frame 
a new constitution. ‘To abrogate its former laws it is driven to 
establish a revolutionary regime in which there are no laws at all: 
from this regime new laws finally emerge. But this second State is 
necessarily less pure than the first, since it derives from the earlier 
one, since, in order to achieve its goal, constitution, it had first to 
install anarchy. Men are pure only in their natural condition; as 
soon as they stray out of it their degradation begins. Give up the 
idea of improving men by laws, give it up. I tell you, by laws you 
will render them greater scoundrels, more cunning, more wicked, 
never more virtuous.” 

“But crime is a plague to the world, Monsignor. The more 
laws there are, the fewer crimes shall there be.” 


734 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘A pretty jest. But seriousness commands us to recognize 
that it’s the multitude of laws that is responsible for this multitude 
of crimes. Cease to believe such-and-such a deed is criminal; make 
no laws to repress it; the crime disappears. 

“But I return to the first part of your proposition: crime, 
you say, is a plague to the world. What sophism! That which de- 
serves to be called a plague to the world would be some destructive 
mechanism threatening the existence of all the world’s inhabitants; 
let us see if crime answers this description. 

‘A crime being committed presents the picture of two individ- 
uals, one of whom is performing the act called criminal, the other 
of whom is being madz this act’s victim. Two individuals: one 
happy, the other unhappy; crime is therefore not a plague in the 
world since, although rendering half the world’s population un. 
happy, it renders the other half very happy indeed. Crime is nought 
but the means Nature employs to attain her ends in regard to us 
and to preserve the equilibrium so indispensable to the maintenance 
of her workings. This explication alone suffices to make clear that it 
is not for man to punish crime, because crime belongs to the Nature 
that possesses every right over us and over which we dispose of 
none. If, viewing it from another angle, crime is the consequence 
of passion, and if the passions, as I have just said, must be beheld 
as the sole springs to great deeds, you should always favor the 
crime which gives energy to your society over the virtues which 
disturb its operations and undermine its strength. You cannot now 
continue to punish crime; you ought instead to encourage it, and 
thrust virtues into the background where they will be buried forever 
under the scorn they deserve from you. We must of course take 
great care not to confuse great deeds with virtues: very often a 
virtue is farthest of all from a great deed, and more often still 
a great deed is sheer crime. Well, great deeds are frequently very 
necessary ; virtues never are. Brutus, the kindly head of his family, 
would have been but a dull and melancholy fellow; Brutus, the 
murderer of Caesar, sirrultaneously performs a crime and a great 
deed: the former personage would have remained unknown to his- 
tory, the latter became one of its heroes.” 

“And so, according to you, one may feel at complete ease 
amidst the blackest crimes ?”’ 


Juliette & 735 


“Tis in virtuous surroundings comfort is impossible since 
it is clear that you then exist in an unnatural situation, in a state 
contrary to the Nature which cannot exist, renew herself, preserve 
her energy and vitality save through the immensity of human 
crimes; and so the best course for us is to endeavor to make vir- 
tues out of all human vices, and vices out of all human virtues.” 

“Tt has been to that end,” said Bracciani, ‘‘that I have toiled 
since the age of fifteen, and I may truthfully report that I have 
enjoyed every minute of my career.” 

““My friend,” Olympia said to Chigi, ‘‘with the ethical be- 
liefs you have just laid before us you must have very lively passions. 
You are forty, the age when they speak most imperiously. Oh, yes, 
you have surely achieved horrors !”” 

“In the position he holds,” said Bracciani, ‘‘with the inspection- 
general of the Rome police, occasions for doing evil must certainly 
not be lacking.” 

“There is no denying it,” said Chigi, ‘‘I am in an exceedingly 
favorable position for doing evil, and it would be yet harder to 
claim that I let pass many occasions for doing it.” 

“You commit injustices . . . you suborn witnesses, you falsify 
evidence,” asked Madame Borghese, ‘‘you use the instruments of 
Themis entrusted to you to doom a good many innocent persons?” 

‘“‘And having done all you say, do no more than act pursuant 
to my principles; which I believe is to do well. If I suppose virtue 
a dangerous thing in this world, am I wrong to immolate those who 
practice it? If, reciprocally, I consider vice useful on earth, am I 
wrong to let escape from the law those who profess it? They call 
me an unjust man, I know, they may, for all I know, call me worse 
yet; their opinion matters not to me: provided my behavior accords 
with my principles I have an easy conscience. Before acting accord- 
ing to those principles I began by analyzing them, then based my 
conduct thereupon; let the entire world blame me, little do I care, 
I have done well by my own lights, and for my actions I am ac- 
countable to no one but myself.” 

“There’s the true philosophy,” Bracciani remarked, “I have 
not developed my principles as much as Chigi, but I assure you that 
they are absolutely the same, and that I put them into practice just 
as often and just as faithfully.” 


736 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘‘Monsignor,” said Olympia to the first magistrate of Rome’s 
police, “‘you are accused of making much too extensive use of the 
strappado; you apply it, they say, to numerous innocents and 
especially to them, prolonging the torture, so we commonly hear, 
to the point where it invariably costs the guiltless party his life.” 

“I am going to elucidate the enigma,” said Bracciani. ‘The 
torture you mention composes this scoundrel’s pleasures; he stiffens 
watching it exercised, he discharges if it does away with the 
patient.” 

“Count,” Chigi retorted, “I fail to notice anything constrain- 
ing you to celebrate my tastes here, nor do I recall having charged 
you to unveil my foibles.” 

‘‘We are much obliged to the Count for this disclosure,” I 
put in with vivacity; “i: announces glad tidings to Olympia, for 
from such a man much can be expected and I will frankly confess 
that what he has reported has already touched me deeply.” 

‘‘And we should be yet more deeply touched,” said Olympia, 
‘‘were Chigi to care to enact his favorite game before us.” 

‘Why not,” the libertine replied; “have you an object to 
hand?” 

“Tl have no difficulty finding one.” 

“Yes, but it may not have all the required qualities.” 

‘“W hat might the required qualities be?” 

‘Those of material indigence,” said Chigi, “‘of blamelessness, 
of the submissiveness due to a supreme judge.” 

‘‘Are you able to combine all that ?” Olympia asked. 

“Oh, yes,” the magistrate assured her, “‘my prisons are teem- 
ing with such individuals and at your demand, in less than an hour 
I’ have produced you something suitable to the pleasures you 
intend to procure yourselves.” 

‘Could you describe the article ?” 

‘‘A young woman of eighteen, a Venus for beauty, and eight 
months pregnant.” 

‘‘Pregnant!” I expostulated. ‘‘And you will subject her in that 
state to such rough handling ?” 

“If worse comes to worst, it will kill her, and as a matter of 
fact it is pretty certain to. But that’s how I like to have them: 


Juliette & 737 


pregnant. You get two pleasures instead of one: it’s what they call 
‘cow and calf.’ ” 

‘And this poor creature,” said I, “I'll wager she is guilt- 
less... .” 

“T’ve had her ripening two months in prison. Her mother sus- 
pects her of a theft I myself had committed in order to get hold of 
the girl; the trap was nicely laid and succeeded irreproachably. 
Cornelia is safe and sound behind bars, and you need but say the 
word and I'll have her do a better rope-dance for you than ever 
was done by any acrobat. Afterward I shall have it bruited that out 
of compassion I had her spirited away to save her from punishment, 
and while covering up what fools call a crime I'll have the merit a 
superb deed confers.” 

“Excellent,” I said; ‘however, this mother you are leaving 
alive, I fear she may someday reveal everything, and won't that 
bring on no end of difficulties? It should surely be easy enough to 
persuade her that she is her daughter’s accomplice and that she was 
party to the theft for which she wishes to see the guilt remain on 
the girl’s shoulders.” 

‘‘And who knows, the family may include a few other mem- 
bers,” the Count suggested. 

““Were there twenty,” said Olympia, “it seems to me that 
Chigi’s personal safety would require murdering them all.” 

“You people are insatiable,” the magistrate sighed, ‘I merely 
ask you not to lay up to your concern for my welfare what really 
originates in your perfidious lust. Alas, there’s nothing to do but 
content it. Cornelia has « brother in addition to a mother ; I promise 
to have all three of them die before our eyes and under the torture 
with whose use the Count wishes to identify the source of my 
pleasures.” 

“Tt is just that we had in mind,” Olympia said; “‘once you go 
so far as to indulge in such bloady pranks as these, I feel you 
should carry them to the limit; I know nothing worse than stop- 
ping halfway. Oh, fuck,” the whore grunted, rubbing her cunt 
through her dress, “I declare to you I’m leaking already.” 

Therewith Chigi rose to his feet and went to issue the neces- 
sary orders. A little garden ringed by dense cypress trees and ad- 


738 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


joining Olympia’s boudoir was chosen for the place of execution, 
and we fondled one another while waiting for the merriment to 
begin. Chigi and Olympia were thoroughly acquainted with each 
other, but Bracciani had never had anything to do with my friend 
and I was unknown to both of the men. So the Princess took it upon 
herself to make the initial advances; such libertines never stand 
long on ceremony. The hussy sets straight to undressing me and 
soon turns me over naked to my two admirers. They devour me, but 
in the Italian style: my ass becomes the unique object of their 
caresses, they both kiss it, tongue it, nibble it, worry it; they make 
tireless and prolonged to-do over it, cannot get their fill of it; and 
behave for all the world as if they are unaware I am a woman. 
After fifteen minutes of these nasty preliminaries some order is 
restored. Bracciani approaches Olympia who has just cast aside her 
every stitch, and I becorne Chigi’s prey. 

‘Do not be impatient, charming creature,” that infamous liber- 
tine says to me, his face zlued to my rump; ‘my capacity for pleas- 
ure dulled from long habituation to its sensations, I must struggle 
before I feel the blunted needle’s prick. It will take time, I may 
weary you, and it may be that I finally fail to do myself honor; but 
you shall have given me pleasure, and that, I think, is quite enough 
for any woman to strive after.” 

And the lecher ratt.ed and banged his tool with all his might, 
the while continuing to savor my bum. 

“Madame,” said he 'o Olympia in whose posterior Bracciani was 
foraging, ‘‘I am not too fond of having thus to do the job all alone; 
it appears to me that the Count would also appreciate some assist- 
ance; you surely have some little girls or boys somewhere about, 
pray send for them. Frizged, licked, pumped, socratized, we shall 
reach the altars of the (Callipygian Venus ready and fresh.” 

Olympia rings, two girls of fifteen promptly answer the sum- 
mons; the libertine always kept the likes within call. 

‘‘Ah, very good, very good,” said the magistrate, “tell them to 
busy themselves promptly at these chores it is disagreeable to have 
to undertake oneself.” 

No sooner heard than obeyed, into the maidens’ hands Chigi 
deposits the unglorious vestiges of his failing manhood, and my 
buttocks continue to be the object of his kisses; his tongue soon 


Juliette & 739 


penetrates; but success is not yet in sight. A luckier Bracciani is 
already inside Olympia’s anus while his young satellite, on her, 
knees behind him, sucks his vent. Peering at this group in action, 
Chigi takes heart; he spreads my buttocks, lays his half-stiffened 
member between them, and has himself flogged to brace his attack. 
. . . The traitor! He dishonors my charms; lacking consistency 
enough to hold his ground, he is put to rout. And for his discomfi- 
ture blames the little girl; she had been fustigating him. 

“Had you laid on harder,” he cries, very wroth, “this would 
never have happened.” So saying he gives the child such a mighty 
buffet he sends her flying three yards away. 

‘‘What’s this, Monsignor, what’s this!” Olympia exclaims. “‘Be 
a little harsher with the slut, take a lash to her, that’s what I 
always do when they disappoint me.” 

“Right you are, Madame,” says Chigi, catching up a whip. 

And despite the graces, the mildnegss, the gentleness of that 
sweet child and despite the beauty of her ass, the barbarian smites 
it with such force that great patches of skin are gone off it by the 
sixth blow. Noticing his glance wander to my behind and that he 
has taken a firmer grip on the whip, ‘‘Strike, libertine,” I say, “be 
bold and strike; I surmise your intentions, I defy your blows. Lay 
on, dear friend, and spare me not.” 

Chigi does not reply to me, he whips me; he whips me so 
soundly that his flabby tool, brought back to life at last, is in 
sufficient fettle to perforate me. I get myself hastily into the proper 
stance, he embuggers me, he is embuggered in his turn, and there we 
are on the threshold of joy. 

“Shall we discharge?” inquires Bracciani, still bum-fucking my 
companion. 

“No,” is Chigi’s answer, “no; we must remember the great 
operation ahead of us, and restrict ourselves for the moment to 
getting into form: only to the agonies of Cornelia and her family, 
to that atrocity alone must we accord our fuck.” 

This resolution is adopted; without concern for our feelings, 
the two libertines instantly dismount and the pleasures of the table 
create a diversion to those of lubricity. In the middle of the meal, 
Chigi, almost drunk, suggests that one of the girls, she whom he 
did not whip, be placed flat upon the table and that we eat a dozen 


740 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


sugared omelettes hot off her buttocks. It’s done; burned to the 
quick, the poor child emits ringing screams, which does not prevent 
the company from digging their forks all the more vigorously into 
bits of food they lift from a platter of bleeding and scorched flesh. 

“It would be amusing to sup a little off her breasts,” Bracciani 
observes. 

‘‘To this you have my agreement,” says Chigi, “provided I am 
allowed to clyster her. With boiling water, be it understood.” 

“And I shall clyster her too. A pint of acid into her cunt,” said 
Olympia in the shrill tone that would enter her voice whenever 
some infamous idea entered her head. 

“Since I must pronounce in my turn,” said I to the assembly, 
“I humbly submit that another serving of omelette be eaten off this 
engaging little thing’s face, that we so manage our silverware as 
to pluck out her eyes, that she then be impaled in the center of the 
table, for a decoration.” 

All these proposals are put into howling effect; we four swill 
and eat ourselves giddy while watching the divine spectacle of that 
charming little girl writhing and slowly expiring in hideous pain. 

“How did you find my dinner?” Borghese asked us as we 
reached dessert. 

“Splendid,” we replied. 

And truly, it had been no less sumptuous than delicate. 

“Why then,” said she, “let’s swallow some of this.” 

It was a liqueur which immediately brought splashing up all 
we had just filled ourselves with, and in the space of three minutes 
our appetite was as keen its it had been before sitting down to dine. 
A second feast is brought on, and we fall to like wolves. 

“A sip now of this other liqueur,” says Olympia, ‘‘and it will 
all flush out below.” 

This ceremony is scarce over when pangs of hunger make 
themselves felt. In comes a third dinner, more succulent than either 
of the preceding two; we begin to feed anew. 

‘No ordinary wine this time,” Olympia says; “‘let’s start with 
Aleatico, we'll end with Falernian, and spirits after cheese.” 

““And the victim?” 

‘‘Jesusfuck,” Chigi declares, “there’s still life in her.” 


Juliette & 741 


“Never mind, let’s get her off the table and buried, dead or 
alive. We shall replace her with a fresh one.” 

No sooner said than done: the first of the girls is prised loose 
and removed and the same great skewer is run into the second 
girl’s asshole, she serves as our centerpiece for the rest of the third 
meal. New to these excesses of the table, I feared I would not be 
able to bear up under them, but was mistaken; emptying the 
stomach, the elixir we were taking soothed it too; and although we 
had each eaten of the ninescore plates offered to our voracity, none 
of us felt any the worse for it. The second victim was still breathing 
when we came to this final dessert; irritated, our libertines had at 
her hammer and tongs. Foaming from fuckshed and drunkenness, 
there was nothing they did not inflict upon her bedraggled body, 
and I must own that I was in the forefront of the general assault. 
Bracciani made a number of physical experiments upon her, the last 
consisted in producing an artificial thunderbolt: it smote her, such 
was the cruel end she came to. Life had just seeped out of her 
when the arrival of Cornelia and her family wakened in us desires 
for new and more frightful horrors. 

If Cornelia’s beauty was without peer, neither was there any- 
thing to match the majesty of feature, the elegance of figure, that 
distinguished her unfortunate mother, aged thirty-five. Leonardo, 
Cornelia’s brother, was only fifteen and in no respect inferior to 
his kin. 

“Ha,” Bracciani exulted as he grabbed the lad to him, “here’s 
the prettiest bardash I’ve laid eyes on in a long time.” 

But this ill-starred family seemed so laden down by an air 
of suffering and sorrow that one could not help but pause a moment 
to consider it in this state; the criminal, you know, always delights 
in battening upon the grief his wickedness has caused the virtuous. 

“TI spy a light kindling in your eyes,” Olympia murmured to 
me. 

“That may well be,” said I, “only a heart of stone would be 
left unmoved by such a spectacle.” 

“I know none more delicious,” the Princess agreed, “‘in all the 
world not one so stirs my bowels and warms my womb.” 

“Prisoners,” spoke forth the magistrate, affecting a solemn 
and awful tone, “you are, I believe, fully aware of your crimes?” 


742 + THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘We have never committed any,” Cornelia replied. 

“For a moment I thought my daughter guilty of a theft but, 
enlightened by your behavior, I have seen through your schemes.” 

‘Madame, you’re going to see them even more clearly later 
on.” 

And we conducted our three captives into the little garden 
prepared for the executions. There Chigi submitted them to a 
thorough questioning; I frigged him meanwhile. You cannot 
imagine with what art he would lure them into a hundred snares, 
nor the subterfuges he employed to trip them up, and notwith- 
standing the candor, the naiveté of their defenses, Chigi found all 
three guilty, very guilty, and pronounced sentence on the spot. 
Olympia pinions the mother, I seize the daughter, the Count and 
the magistrate leap upon the youth. 

A few preliminary tortures seemed in order before turning to 
the final one with whick these orgies were to conclude. Olympia 
must take a whip to Cornelia’s belly, with rods Bracciani and Chigi 
beat Leonardo’s fair buttocks all to tatters, and I mauled the 
mother’s breasts. In due time we bound their arms behind their 
backs and attached the fatal ropes. Again and again they were 
hoisted a goodly distance into the air and dropped nearly to the 
ground; fifteen consecutive bounces wrench their shoulders from 
the socket, break their arms, split their breast-bones, tear their 
chests amain, at the tenth the infant in Cornelia’s womb drops out 
and flies into Chigi’s lap, whose member I am frigging upon 
Olympia’s hinder parts, while Bracciani is working the windlass. 
The sight of this accident made us all discharge, and the frightful 
truth is that we kept rigsht on with the game. Though .our sperm 
was spent and our heads calm, none of us thought to beg quarter; 
and the bouncing continied until we had bounced the ghost clean 
out of those wretches. Thus it is crime will sport with innocence 
when, having wealth and influence on its side, nought remains for 
it to do but combat misfortune and poverty. 

The appalling project planned for the morrow was carried out 
brilliantly. From a terrace Olympia and I surveyed the disaster, 
frigging ourselves as the conflagrations spread. By evening the 
thirty-seven asylums were all in flames and the dead already ex- 
ceeded twenty thousand. 


Juliette & 743 


“Godsfuck!’” I exclaimed to Olympia, discharging at the en- 
chanting spectacle of her and her confederates’ crimes, ‘‘how divine 
it is to perform such pieces of mischief! Inexplicable and mysterious 
Nature, if ’tis true these evil acts outrage thee, why makest thou 
me to delight in them? Ah, wench, thou deceivest me perhaps, as of 
old I was by the foul deific chimera to which they said thou wert 
subordinate; and what if we were no more thy bondsmen than a 
god’s? Causes, may be, are unnecessary to effects, and we all, 
through some blind force that is in us, a force both irrational and 
essential, we are but stupid machines of the vegetation whose secret 
workings, explaining the origin of all motion, also demonstrate the 
origin of all human and animal activity.” 

The fire lasted eight days and nights during which we had no 
glimpse of our friends; they reappeared on the ninth morning. 

“It is all over,” said the magistrate; “the Pope has ceased 
wringing his hands; I have been granted the privilege I was seek- 
ing: my profit is as well as in the bank, and here are your rewards. 
Dear Olympia,” Chigi continued, “that which would most surely 
have touched your benevolent heart was the burning of the con- 
servatorios; had you only been able to see all those little maids, 
panic-stricken, naked, trampling one another in their maddened 
efforts to escape the flames, and the horde of ruffians I had stationed 
at the entrances, pitchforks in hand, while pretending to rescue 
them driving the greater part back into the fire but saving a few, 
the prettiest of the lot, to be sure, who shall live until the day they 
are sacrificed to my tyrannical lust... . Ah, Olympia, Olympia, had 
you been witness to all that you’d have died of pleasure.” 

“Villain,” said Madame Borghese, ‘‘how many have you pre- 
served ?”” 

“Nearly two hundred; for the time being they are under guard 
in one of my palaces and shall later on be parceled out to my farms 
in the country. The best twenty specimens shall be yours, I promise 
them to you, and by way of thanks ask only that from time to time 
you bring me other such creatures as this charming person,” 
Monsignor said, pointing to me. 

“Why,” said Olympia, “from what I know of your philosophy 
upon this article, it surprises me that you still think of her.” 

“IT admit,” said the magistrate, “that my sympathies do not 


744 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


by any means go with the giving of my prick; signs that to the fuck- 
ing she gets from me a woman is responding by love is enough for 
me to cease paying her in any coin save that of scorn and hate. 
Indeed, I have very often conceived both those sentiments for the 
object about to become of service to me, and my pleasures, taken in 
this manner, have gained considerably therefrom. All this relates to 
my beliefs touching gratitude; I do not like having a woman imagine 
I am somehow indebted to her because I soil myself from contact 
with her; of her I demand nothing beyond submission, and the 
same insensibility as the convenience upon which I sit every day 
when I clear my bowels. I have never thought that from the junction 
of two bodies there need or indeed can result that of two hearts: 
this physical connection, in my view, is fraught with great possibili- 
ties for contempt, for disgust, for loathing, but with none at all for 
love; I know of nothing so gigantic as that sentiment, nothing so 
apt to pall pleasure, nothing, in a word, that is farther from my 
heart. However, Madame, I dare assure you with a degree of 
warmth,” Chigi went on, taking my hands in his, “‘that the mental- 
ity you have shown yourself to possess sets you apart in my estima- 
tion, and that you will always merit consideration from all libertine 
philosophers; having credited you with intelligence, I take it for 
granted that you are eager to please only them.” 

From these flatteries, whereof I made no great case, we 
passed on to more serious things. Chigi wished for yet another 
glimpse of my ass, declaring that his interest in it was positively 
indefatigable. So he and I, Bracciani, and Olympia removed into 
the secret sanctuary of the Princess’ pleasures where further in- 
famies were celebrated znd, upon my honor, I blush at describing 
them to you. That accursed Borghese was prone to the most fan- 
tastic practices. A eunuch, a hermaphrodite, a dwarf, an eighty- 
year-old woman, a turkey, a small ape, a very big mastiff, a she-goat, 
and a little boy of four, the great-grandchild of the old woman, 
were the lust-objects presented us by the Princess’ duenna. 

“Great God,” I cried at beholding this menagerie, ‘what 
depravation!” 

“It’s the most natural thing in the world,” Bracciani reminded 
me; “as you wear out one pleasure you are obliged to look for 
another; this leads far. Tired of commonplace things, you desire 


Juliette & 745 


unusual ones, and that is why crime becomes the final station of 
lust. I know not, Juliette, what use you will find for these bizarre 
objects, but you may be certain that the Princess, my friend Mon- 
signor Chigi, and I shall enjoy ourselves mightily among them.” 

“Why, I must simply accommodate myself,” said I; “you'll 
never see me hang back where it is a question of debauchery or 
incongruities.”’ 

Even as I was speaking, the mastiff, doubtless trained in the 
trick, began to snuffle beneath my petticoats. 

“Ah ha! Lucifer is under way,” said Olympia with a laugh. 
“Undress yourself, Juliette; surrender your charms to this superb 
animal’s libidinous caresses, it can prove a memorable experience.” 

I consent, needless to say; for what horror could have revolted 
me, I who devoted every one of my days to the quest of every kind 
of horror? Getting down on all fours I take up my position in the 
center of the room; the dog circles me, sniffs me, licks me, mounts 
me, and finishes by encunting me as nicely as you please, and dis- 
charging into my womb. But a rather peculiar thing happened: the 
beast’s member had swollen to such proportions in the course of our 
conversation that his attempts to withdraw now caused me enor- 
mous discomfort. Failing to extricate himself, he seemed disposed to 
start in again; we decided that the simpler way would be to let him 
do so; sufficiently reduced by a second discharge, he pulled out a 
still colossal engine after having twice washed me with his sperm. 

“There’s a fine fellow,” said Chigi; “you're going to see my 
lord Lucifer deal as handsomely with me as he has with Juliette. 
Extremely libertine in his tastes, this charming animal honors beauty 
wherever it is to be found: I wager he will fuck my ass with no less 
delectation than he has just fucked madame’s cunt. But I propose 
to do more than dreamily endure an assault. Bring me that nanny, 
let me fuck it while playing whore to Lucifer.” 

I had never seen anything as bizarre as this play. Chigi, spar- 
ing of his seed, loosed none; but had nonetheless the look of taking 
wonderful pleasure from this voluptuous extravagance. 

“Now watch me,” said Bracciani, stepping to the fore, “I shall 
put on a different spectacle for you.” 

He has himself embuggered by the eunuch and embuggers the 
turkey. Olympia, her bare buttocks turned toward him, held the 


746 %& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


bird’s neck wedged between her thighs; she beheads it the same in- 
stant the physician ejaculates. 

“That,” Bracciani assured us, ‘‘can afford exquisite pleasure; 
there is no describing the effect of a turkey’s anus contracting as 
you cut off its head at the critical instant.” 

“T have never tried it,” said Chigi, “but so loudly and so often 
have I heard this manner of fucking praised that I believe the time 
has come to see for myself. Juliette,” he went on, “be a dear and 
hold this child between your thighs while I embugger it; blasphemies 
will announce my delirium, that will be the signal for you to cut 
the little rascal’s throat.” 

‘All very well,” said Olympia, “but Juliette must have some 
pleasure in return for facilitating yours. I shall place the her- 
maphrodite to her mouth: caressing its two sexes at once, she'll suck 
out proof first of its virility and then of its female existence.” 

“Wait,” said Bracciani, “positions may so be arranged as to 
enable me to bum-stuff the hermaphrodite and take an ass-fucking 
from the eunuch, the crone’s bum being posed above my face so that 
she splatters shit over my features.” 

“What nastiness!” said Olympia 

“Madame,” said the Count, taking her up very quickly, “‘it has 
its explanation; there is not a single taste, not a single penchant 
which may not be shown to have a cause.” 

“Since this is to be a collective enterprise,” said Chigi, “I'll 
have the monkey sodomize me while the dwarf, straddling the 
child, presents me his ass for kissing.” 

“But there remains Lucifer, the goat, and myself,” Olympia 
bade us notice. 

‘“‘We can easily find a place for everybody,” said Chigi. “If you 
and the goat stand close enough to me I'll insert myself now in your 
ass, now in the animal’s, Lucifer embuggering the one while I am 
busy with the other; but I still hold to my intention of discharging 
in the youngster’s fundament, and do not forget, Juliette, you’re to 
play the butcher when I am overtaken by my spasm.” 

The tableau is composed; never was anything so monstrous 
achieved in lubricity; we discharged none the less for that, all of us; 
off came the child’s head at just the right moment; and when we 


Juliette %& 747 


quit our complex formation it was for each to extol the heavenly 
pleasures by which our originality had just been rewarded.” 

The rest of the day was spent in more or less similar lewd 
doings. I was fucked by the ape; once again by the mastiff, but 
asswardly; by the androgyne, by the eunuch, by the two Italians, by 
Olympia’s dildo. All the others frigged me, licked me, teated me 
in every part, and it was only after ten hours of piquant enjoyment 
I came out of those peculiar orgies. A delicious supper crowned the 
holiday; a Greek sacrifice was celebrated: firewood was collected, 
all the animals we had frolicked with were slaughtered ritually and 
lubriciously, their bodies thrown upon the pyre and, atop the holo- 
caust, bound hand and foot, the crone was burned alive; only the 
eunuch and the hermaphrodite were left, and with them we flew on 
to other pleasures. 


Five months had I been in Rome and I was nigh to wondering 
whether I should ever obtain the audience with the Pope that Car- 
dinals Bernis and Albani had led me to hope for, when at last, 
several days after the adventure I have just related, I received a 
gallant little note from Bernis who besought me to come to him 
early the following morning, he would present me to His Holiness 
who, though he had wished to see me long ere this, had been unable 
to satisfy his desire until now. I was advised to array myself simply 
but at the same time with elegance, and to avoid all perfumes. 
“Braschi, tike Henry IV,” the Cardinal wrote, “prefers that each 
thing smell as it should smell; he abominates art, stands fast for 
Nature. Hence it is essential that you abstain even from the bidet.” 

Obedient in all these points, I reached the Cardinal’s palace 
by ten o’clock. Pius was awaiting us at the Vatican. 

“Holy Father,” Bernis said, presenting me to him, “here is the 
young ¥renchwoman you have wished to see. Singularly honored by 


20 The more unusual it was, the more pleasure it was bound to give, of this 
none of the rational participants could be in any doubt; for thus it is with all 
lubricities. No passion in the world demands so many aliments as that one; there is 
none that needs to be tended with more care: the more it asks, the more one must 
give it; and what we receive therefrom depends strictly upon what we sacrifice to it. 


748 cf THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the favor you do her, she promises unquestioning compliance with 
all it may please Your Holiness to demand of her.” 

“She shall not repent her complacency,” said Braschi. “Before 
turning to the impurities wherewith we shall be occupied I welcome 
this opportunity for a private interview With her. Go, Cardinal, and 
tell the chamberlains that the gates shall be closed to everybody 
today.” 

Bernis retires and His Holiness, taking me by the hand, escorts 
me through immense apartments until we come to a remote chamber 
where luxury and effemiracy, under the drab colors of religion and 
modesty, offered everything that most flatters the lascivious dis- 
position. It was all blurred outlines, melting distinctions: next to a 
Theresa in ecstasy one saw a Messalina embuggered, underneath 
an image of Christ there crouched a Leda. ... 

“Repose yourself,’ Braschi said to me. “In this place of ease I 
forget distances, and smiling upon vice when it appears in shapes as 
amiable as yours, I permit it to sit at virtue’s side.” 

“Brazen fraud,” I said to that old despot, “‘you are so in the 
habit of deceiving others that you seek even to deceive yourself. 
What the devil is this p:-attle of virtue when your sole purpose in 
bringing me here is to sully yourself with vice?” 

“I am not of those who can be soiled, dear girl,” the Pope 
replied to me. “Successor of the disciples of God, the virtues of the 
Eternal gird me round, and I am not a man even when for a 
moment I adopt human failings.” 

After letting loose a burst of ungovernable laughter, “Bishop 
of Rome!” I cried, “enough of this insolent haughtiness, desist, I 
say, you are speaking to a woman who is philosopher enough to 
appreciate you; with ycur leave we shall look a little into your 
power and your pretens ons. 

‘In Galilee, Braschi, there develops a religion, its bases are 
these: poverty, equality, and hatred of the rich. The principles of 
this sacred doctrine are that it is just as impossible for a rich man 
to enter into the kingdora of heaven as for a camel to pass through 
the eye of a needle; that the rich man is damned simply because he 
is rich. To the disciples of this cult it is forbidden ever to lay up 
provision, they are commanded to forsake all that they have. Jesus, 
their chief, is emphatic and clear: “The Son of God came not to be 


Juliette 3 749 


ministered unto, but to minister. . . . They that are first shall be 
last... . Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that 
humbles himself shall be exalted.’?! The first apostles of this reli- 
gion earned their living by the sweat of their brow. Is all this not 
true, Braschi ?”’ 

“Tt is indeed true.” 

‘Well then, I would now have you tell me what relation there 
can be between these primitive institutions and the tremendous 
wealth you accumulate here in Italy. Is it the Evangile or the 
knavery of your predecessors that has put you in possession of 
these boundless riches? Poor fellow! and do you fancy you can 
still impose upon us?” 

“Atheist, at least show respect for the descendant of Saint 
Peter.” 

“You descend from nothing of the sort: Saint Peter never set 
foot in Rome. At its beginnings and for many years to come the 
Church had no bishops, only acquired them when, toward the end 
of the second century of our era, it came somewhat to be known 
and to take on a little consistency; how dare you maintain Peter 
was in Rome when he himself wrote from Babylon?” 

“Do you think to confound criticism by saying that Rome and 


21 And what passeth all understanding is that the Jacobins of the French Revo- 
lution wanted to smash the altars of a God who spoke precisely their own language. 
Yet more extraordinary, they who detest and want to destroy the Jacobins act in the 
name of a God who speaks like the Jacobins. If this be not here the ze plus ultra of 
human folly, I ask you where it is to be found. (Supplementary notc.) 

22The Peter of the Christians is nothing else than the Annac, the Hermes, and 
the Janus of the Ancients; all individuals to whom the gift of opening doors to some 
beatitude or other was attributed. In Phoenician or in Hebrew the word peter means 
to open; and Jesus, playing thereupon, could say to Peter: “Since thou art Peter”— 
that is to say, he who opens—“thou shalt open the gates to the kingdom of heaven,” 
just as taking from peter only its meaning of the Oriental word kepha, which means 
building stone, he had said: “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my 
church.” Mine was once used to denote what is brought forth from a mine; similarly, 
may they not have called opening what was extracted from the quarry, to which the 
name opening was formerly given? Thus, the words fo open and stone may have had 
the same meaning, whence the pun made by Jesus, that imbecile who, as everyone 
knows, never opened his mouth but riddles, anagrams, or puzzles came out of it. His 
talk is all tedious allegory, where places are joined on to names, names to places, and 
the facts always sacrificed to illusions. At any rate, this apostolic word is a very 
ancient one, dating from long before the days of Christianity’s Peter. Most mytholo- 
gists have recognized it as the title of a person appointed to care for the posterula. 


750 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Babylon were the same thing? Pouah, nobody believes anything you 
say anymore. But was Peter even your type of man? Is not your 
predecessor depicted to us as a penniless ragged fellow who cate- 
chized the penniless and ragged? It would much appear that he re- 
sembled one of those founders of orders that live in indigence 
and whose successors swiin in gold. I know that those who followed 
Peter sometimes gained money, sometimes lost it; but it is nonethe- 
less true that superstition and credulity are yet so widespread that 
you still have some thirty or forty million servants on earth. But 
do you suppose the lamp of philosophy is not soon to shine before 
their eyes? Do you suppose they shall for very long go on accept- 
ing a master who dwells three or four hundred leagues away? That 
they shall for much longer be willing to think, judge, act only 
according to your dictates? Hold title to their properties only upon 
condition they pay you tribute, enter into no marriage save it be 
with your approval? No. my friend, you miscalculate if you count 
upon them remaining still a long while in bondage and error. I 
know that in times past your ridiculous rights went a great deal 
farther than now they dc; you used to sit above the very gods, for 
those gods were only thought to dispose of empires while twas you 
who disposed of them. Fut I repeat it to you, Braschi, all that is 
being eclipsed, it is passing away; and in fact, my dear Pope, is it 
not staggering to see to what point superstition can denature the 
simplest things? Agree with me, that one is hard put to know which 
one ought most to admire, the prodigious blindness of whole peo- 
ples, or the gigantic effrontery of those who dupe them. How is it 
possible, after the appalling irregularities in which you and your 
like have been wallowing for centuries with the entire world look- 
ing on, that you can still be revered as you are? How is it possible 
that you still keep a few proselytes? "Twas only the stupidity of 
princes and of populations that consolidated the grandeur of the 
popes and gave them the inconceivable audacity to arrogate to 
themselves pretensions sc.contrary to the spirit of their religion, so 
revolting to reason, anc. so harmful to polities. Those who are 
aware of the grip superstition exerts must still be amazed at its 
perennial successes; for there is not a single blunder, not a single 
extravagance to which the devout are not prone. Certain political 
interests conspired to aid the growth of superstition’s child. During

the years of the Roman Empire’s decline, its chiefs, occupied in 
costly and very remote wars, were constrained to deal tactfully 
with you, knowing you to be in possession of the minds of the 
people; shutting their eyes to your enterprises they unwittingly 
promoted the destruction of their empire; through ignorance, the 
barbarian hordes adopted the political system of the emperors, and 
that is how, little by little, you became the masters of a fair part 
of the European peoples. 

“The sciences were entrusted into the hands of the monks, 
your worthy liegemen; no one was permitted to shed light on the 
universe, men were in bondage to what they did not understand, 
and the warriors who fought around the world found it easier to 
bend you a worshipful knee than to analyze you. The fifteenth 
century brought a shift in the wind, the dawning of philosophy 
heralded superstition’s downfall; clouds lifted and men dared look 
you in the face. In you and yours they soon came to see nothing but 
impostors and frauds; a few nations still subjugated by their priests 
remained faithful to you; but the light of reason’s torch shines at 
last for them as well. Oh, my good, my blessed Pope! your role is 
ended. To hasten the important revolution. which must bring down 
forever the pillars of your superstitious establishment one need only 
cast a glance at the history of your antecedents in the See. I shall 
outline it for you, Braschi, from my erudition it will be shown that 
since the women of my country are instructed to this degree, the 
France I am proud of shall not be long shaking off your ridiculous 
yoke. 

‘What do I behold at the beginning of your Christian era? 
Battles, strife, tumults, seditions, massacres, the fruit solely of the 
greed and the ambition of the rogues who pretended to your 
throne; the proud pontiffs of your disgusting Church were already 
going in triumphal cars through Rome; lust and lewdness were 
already defiling them; the purple enwrapped them already; and ’tis 
not your enemies I consult for evidence of the reproaches addressed 
to you in those days, no, I refer to your partisans, to the very 
Fathers of the Church; listen to Jerome, to Basil: ‘When I was in 
Rome,’ says the former, ‘I sought to make the language of piety 
and virtue heard; the Pharisees surrounding the Pope jeered and 
tormented me; and I quit the palaces of Rome to return to the 


752 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


grottoes of Jesus.’ Thus did your satellites, driven to it by the force 
of truth, level the accusing finger at you even at this early hour. 
With what vehemence the same Jerome elsewhere rebukes you for 
the scandals occasioned by your debauches, your dishonesties, your 
intrigues to milk money from the rich, to have yourselves named 
the heirs of the mighty and above all of the Roman ladies you first 
tupped and then dunned. Shall I send you to read the emperors’ 
edicts? See therein the efforts Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian 
deployed to repress your greed, your libertinage, your overweening 
ambition. But let us go on with our sketch and paint in broad 
strokes. Do you fancy, Braschi, do you believe that one can have 
anything but doubts of your holiness, of your infallibility, when 
one observes: 

‘A Liberius, out of fear and weakness dragging the entire 
Church into Arianism ? 

“A Gregory, proscribing the arts and sciences, and giving as 
reason for this that ignorance alone can favor the absurdities of 
his loathsome religion—a Gregory who dares carry impudence so 
far as to flatter Queen }runhilde, that monster whom France re- 
members with shame to this day? 

“A Stephen VI regarding Formosus, his predecessor, as so de- 
filed by crimes that he fzels under the ridiculous and barbaric ob- 
ligation of punishing the dead pope’s corpse ? 

“A Sergius, soiled by all sorts of debauchery, whores always 
leading him around by‘the nose? 

“A John XI, son of one of those sluts, and who himself lived 
in regular incest with Marosia, his mother? 

“A John XII, the iclolatrous magician who employed the very 
temple of God as the theater for his most shameful debauches? 

“A Boniface VII, so eager for the papal tiara that he murders 
Benedict VI in order to succeed him ??3 

“A Gregory VII, who, more despotic than any king, made 
them all come begging pardon at his door; who caused seas of 


23 There was then in Rome a certain Gerardius Brazet, regarded as the Holy 
See’s official poisoner; he had envenomed eight popes, upon the orders of those who 
were anxious to succeed them. The Vatican pontiffs of that time, says Baronius, were 
such great villains that never before in any age had the like of them been seen, nor 
so many scenes of horror. 


Juliette 753 


blood to be shed in Germany, uniquely for the sake of his pride and 
ambition; who maintained that a pope could do no wrong; that all 
popes were infallible; that to be seated in Saint Peter’s chair 
sufficed to render a man as powerful as Almighty God? 

“A Pascal II, who, in observance of these abominable princi- 
ples, dares arm an emperor against his own father ? 

“An Alexander III, who has Henry II of England ignomini- 
ously flogged for a murder that prince never committed; who 
promulgates the bloody crusade against the Albigensians? 

“A Celestine III, who, overflowing ambition and tyranny, 
dares use his foot to push the crown upon the head of Henry IV, 
prostrate before him; and then kicks that crown off again, to show 
the Emperor what is in store for him should he be lacking in respect 
for the Pope? 

“An Innocent IV, poisoner of Emperor Frederick during the 
interminable wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines, for which 
your pride and your passions were responsible and which brought 
about the demoralization of all Italy? 

‘“‘A Clement IV, who has a young prince decapitated for having 
done nothing worse than present a claim to the succession of his 
fathers? 

“A Boniface VIII, famous for his quarrels with the kings of 
France; impious, ambitious, the author of that sacred farce known 
under the name of Jubilee, the single purpose whereof is to fill the 
pontifical coffers ?* 

“A Clement V, enough of a scoundrel to have slain Emperor 
Henry VI by means of a poisoned host ? 

“A Benedict XII, who buys celebrated Petrarch’s sister to 
make her his mistress ? 

“A John XXIII [sic.], notorious for his extravagances; who 
condemns as heretics all who maintain that Jesus Christ lived in 
simple poverty, who distributed crowns, who changed just into 
unjust, and whose madness led him to the point of excommunicating 
angels? 

“A Sixtus IV, who drew a considerable revenue from the 


24It is of him they said that he mounted the throne like a fox, reigned there 
like a lion, and died like a dog. 


754 2% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


brothels he had installed in Rome, who sent the Swiss a crimson 
flag, and with it the invitation to cut one another’s throats for the 
prosperity of the Roman Church? 

“An Alexander VI, the mere mention of whose name is enough 
to excite the indignation and horror of those who have some idea 
of his story; an enormous scoundrel, without probity, or honor, 
or sincerity, or pity, or religion, whose lewd debauchery, cruelties, 
poisonings surpassed everything Suetonius reports of Tiberius, 
Nero, and Caligula; in fine, a libertine who lay with his own 
daughter Lucrezia,” who was wont to have fifty naked whores run 
about on all fours, in order to fire his imagination from the various 
postures they assumed? 

“A Leo X, who to repair the depredations of his predecessors, 
invented the scheme of selling indulgences, though such an un- 
believer that in reply to his friend Cardinal Bembo, who quoted 
him a passage out of Scripture, he could say: ‘What the devil are 
you up to, coming to me with your Jesus Christ fables?’ 

“A Julius ITI, that true Sardanapalus, who carried impudence 
to the point of raising his catamite to be a cardinal; who one day, 
nude in his chamber, obliged the members of the College who 
entered there to remove their clothes too, saying, ‘My friends, if 
we were to go about thus in the streets of Rome, we would be not 
so much revered. Now if our raiments alone inspire respect, are 
we really nothing at all without them? 

‘“‘A Pius V, adored for a saint, fanatical, tigerish, who was 
the cause of all the persecutions exercised against the Protestants 
in France; instigator of the Duke of Alba’s ferocities; murderer 
of Paleario whose only crime was having said that the Inquisition 
had a dagger for stabbing men of letters; and who finally declared 
that he had never been :n so little hope of salvation as since he 
became Pope? 

“A Gregory XIII, frightful panegyrist of the St. Bartholo- 
mew massacre and who privately addressed letters of congratu- 
lation to Charles IX ror having himself participated in the 
slaughter ? 


25 Of her the poet Jacopo Sannazaro, the Neapolitan Petrarch, tells us: 
Hoc jacet in tumula Lucretia nomine sedra, 
Thais Alexandria filia, sponsa nurus. 


Juliette de 755 


‘‘A Sixtus V, who declared that in Rome one could bugger and 
be buggered as much as he liked during the hottest part of summer, 
and whose method for establishing order and calm in that city was 
to bathe it in blood ? 

“A Clement VIII, author of the famous Gunpowder Plot? 

“A Paul V, who waged war against Venice because a civil 
magistrate had presumed to punish a monk for having raped and 
killed a twelve-year-old girl? 

“A Gregory XV, writing to Louis XIII: ‘Put them all to fire 
and sword who abide not by me’? 

“An Urban VIII, who cooperated in those Irish massacres 
where one hundred and fifty thousand Protestants died, etc., etc. ? 

“There they are, my friend, such are they who were the Vicar 
of Christ before you. And you are amazed, you are vexed, you 
are downcast and confounded that we hold in just horror the 
insolent or corrupt leaders of such a sect? Ah! may all nations be 
quick to rid themselves of their illusions regarding these papal 
idols who until now have procured them nought but trouble, in- 
digence, and woe! Let all the peoples of the earth, shuddering 
at the terrible havoc wrought for so many centuries by this long 
line of rascals, hasten to dethrone him who is Pope today and at 
the same time put an end to the stupid and barbarous, the idola- 
trous, sanguinary, impious, infamous religion capable of having 
such monsters at its head.” 

Pius VI, who to all this had lent a very attentive ear, sat 
gazing in astonishment at me when I reached the end of my speech. 

“Braschi,” said I, ‘thou art surprised at my wit and learning; 
know that it is thus all the children in my country are nowadays 
brought up: the age of error is past. Act accordingly, old despot, 
break thy cross, burn thy hosts, fling thy gauds and thy images 
and thy relics on the dungheap: after having freed populations 
from the oath of fealty that bound them to sovereigns, free them 
now from error’s dungeons where thou holdest them prisoner. 
Believe me, get thee down off thy throne ere thou art submerged 
beneath its wreckage; better to cede thy place pacifically than to 
be evicted from it by force. Opinion rules everything in the world; 
it is changing toward thee and all thy mummeries. Vary in tune 
with the times. When the scythe is uplifted, wiser to step aside 


756 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


than await the blade. Thou art not poor; retire, become a simple 
citizen in Rome again. Change the funeral livery of all this frocked 
crowd hanging about thee, dismiss thy friars, open thy cloisters, 
liberate thy nuns, let them marry, drown not the seed of one hun- 
dred generations in the barren ocean of chastity. Awestruck Europe 
shall admire thee, thy name shall be writ big on the columns of 
memory, never shall it be recorded there save thou exchangest the 
melancholy honor of being pope for that, far more precious, of 
being a philosopher.” 

“Juliette,” Braschi said, “they did indeed tell me you were a 
clever girl, but you outdo all reports; such loftiness of ideas is 
extremely rare in a woman. It is not with you feigning is best, I 
drop the mask; behold te man, behold him who is set on enjoying 
you and who shall not higgle over the price.” 

“Listen to me,” I replied, “‘it is not to play the vestal I have 
come here, and since I let myself be enticed into the most myster- 
lous recesses of your palace you must surely be aware I have no 
intention of resisting vou; but instead of getting a congenial 
partner, an ardent woman, someone of flesh and bone, with an 
intuition into your tastes, a fondness for them, you'll have nought 
but a stone statue unless you grant me four things, and they are 
these: 

“To begin with I demand, as a first mark of trust, that you 
give me the keys to ycur most secret chambers; I wish to visit 
every nook, every cranny, to see all of what each contains. 

“The second thing I would have from you is a dissertation 
upon murder: I.myself have murdered rather a lot, and have my 
views upon the question; I am eager to hear yours. What you say 
shall probably fix my .attitude definitively; not that I believe you 
incapable of error, but I have confidence in the studies you must 
have made; you will speak frankly to me, for philosophers cannot 
trifle with anything but the truth. 

“My third condition is that you convince me of your profound 
contempt for all the rigamarole and ritual cant of Christian wor- 
ship; to do so you have simply to proceed thus: after having had 
your chaplains celebrate High Mass upon the ass of a bardash, 
and having with your holy prick rammed the little flour-and-water 
God into my anus, you will then fuck me on Saint Peter’s altar. 


Juliette & 757 


I warn you that I shall not be fucked by you in any other way. 
Such follies are nothing new to me, but the idea of seeing them 
committed by you rouses me. 

“The fourth clause is, that inside several days you give me 
a lavish supper with Albani, Bernis, and my friend Princess 
Borghese, that at this supper there sparkle more lewdness and 
glitter, more libertinage than was ever displayed by any pope of 
old, the occasion must be gayer a thousand times, and for infamy 
a thousand times richer than the feast Alexander VI had served 
to Lucrezia.” 

“Assuredly, 
ditions.” 

“Either you accept them or never in your life shall you possess 
me.” 

“Young woman, you seem not to realize that I have youin my 
power, and that at a mere word from me—”’ 

“I know that you are a tyrant,” I interrupted, ‘that you are 
base and a knave, cruel and wicked: without those qualities, it’s 
obvious, you’d not be in the post you hold; but forasmuch as I am 
no less a rascal than you, you love me. You love me, Braschi. It 
makes you glad to see to what point wickedness of your own sort 
can fill the soul of a woman; I am your joy, mighty Braschi, and 
you shall be mine, little Braschi; you shall satisfy me.” 

“Oh, Juliette,” Pius VI said to me, folding me in his arms, 
“you are a most uncommon creature, your genius is irresistible, I 
shall be your slave; with the mind that appears to be yours, I am 
in expectation of very piquant pleasures from you, of enormities. 
Here, the keys, they are on this ring . . . take them, go visit my 
abode; after I have received your favors I promise you the 
dissertation you solicit. As well, you may count upon the supper 
you demand, and as for the profanation your heart is set on, it 
shall take place this very night. I accord no more faith than you 
to all those spiritual mummeries, my angel; but you know the 
obligation we are under to make fools of the simple. I am like the 
charlatan with his quackeries, I must look as though I believed in 
the stuff if I am to vend it.” 

“There’s plain proof you are a rascal,” I said; ‘‘were you 
honest you would prefer to enlighten mankind rather than deceive 


” said Braschi, “these are indeed strange con-

it; you would tear the blind from their eyes rather than tighten it.” 

“Of course; but I'd starve to death.” 

‘“‘And what necessity is there that you live? Is it so urgent 
that, for the sake of your digestion, fifty million people wander in 
error?” 

“Yes, because my existence means everything to me, and those 
fifty million people nothing; because the foremost of Nature’s 
laws is of self-preservation . .. at the expense of no matter whom.” 

“You are showing vour true colors, Pontiff, that is all I was 
after. So let us shake hands, since we’re a pair of rogues each as 
bad as the other, and henceforth an end to all shamming; agreed ?” 

“Excellent,” said the Pope, “we'll concern ourselves with 
pleasures only.” 

“Very well,” I rejoined, ‘start by carrying out one of your 
promises; get me a guide, I wish to tour this place.” 

“I shall guide you through it myself,” said Braschi. 

“This superb palace,” he told me as we walked along, “‘stands 
on the site of an ancient one in whose gardens the paths were 
illuminated at night by the bodies of the early Christians; Nero 
had them spaced at regular intervals and daubed with pitch. They 
served as flares.’’”® 


“6 But let us translate straight out of Tacitus: “He caused the Christians to be 
put cruelly to death for having set fire to Rome. These Christians,” the historian con- 
tinues, “were people hated for their infamy, and because of a rogue named Christ, 
their spiritual leader, who had been executed under the reign of Tiberius. But after 
having been repressed for a while this pernicious sect bred up a stench anew, not 
only in its place of origin but in Rome itself, whither all roads lead and, as it were, 
all sewers too. First to be seized were those who professed openly to belong to this 
vile cult, their avowals led to the arrest of a great crowd of similar wretches, who 
were convicted of atrocious c:imes. Hatred for them was general and unbounded, 
whereof the proof is the disgraceful deaths they were made to die, covered by the 
skins of wild beasts and left to the dogs, or affixed to crosses and left to rot, or 
again burned in heaps like faggots, to light the streets and highways (it is the source 
of the expression lux in luce). Nero willingly lent his gardens for these spectacles. He 
would be seen, dressed as a driver, mingling among the people or seated in a chariot. 
Those executions of Christians amused him hugely, he often took a direct hand in 
them.” 

Listen now to what Lucian tells us of this same sect: “It is an assembly of rag- 
ged vagabonds, fanatical of eye, frenzied of gesture, uttering moans, doing con- 
tortions, swearing by the son begot of the father, predicting a thousand awful 
calamities to the Empire, reviling all those not of their belief.” Such was the Chris- 
tian religion from the very outset: a horde of troublemakers and scurvy fellows fol- 


Juliette 2% 759 


“Oh, my friend, such a spectacle is made for eyes like mine, 
a joyous sight it would have been to one animated by my own 
loathing for your creed and its adepts.” 

“Forget not, little minx,” said the Holy Father, “that ’tis to 
the head of this religion you are speaking.” 

“He has as little liking for it as I,” was my response, “‘he 
knows what it is worth; and esteems it only for the income it yields 
him. Come, come, my friend, were you able, you would deal just 
as harshly with the enemies of the religion off which you fatten.” 

“Certainly, Juliette: intolerance is the underlying principle 
of the Church; without an implacable rigorism, its temples would 
be quickly in ruins; and where the law is unheeded the sword must 
smite.” 

‘‘Despotic Braschi!” 

“But how else would you have princes reign? Their power is 
seated upon mere opinion; let it change and they are undone. Their 
one means for stabilizing it consists in terrorizing the public, in 
putting fear into hearts and a cloud over vision, in order that 
pygmies appear as giants.” 

“Ah, Braschi, I have told you so already, the people are com- 
ing to their senses; the days of the tyrants are numbered; the 
scepters they hold and the irons they impose, all will be shattered 
upon the altars of Liberty, as the cedar topples before the north 
wind’s blast. Far too long has despotism deprived them of their 
rights, the people must inevitably reach out and take them back, 
a general revolution must inevitably rage over all Europe; all must 
come tumbling down, shrines and thrones with it, and space must 
be cleared for double the energy of a Brutus and twice the virtues 
of a Cato.” 

We were still walking. “A thorough visit of these buildings 
is no mean undertaking,” Braschi said to me; ‘the palace contains 
four thousand four hundred and twenty-two rooms, includes 


lowed about by whores. The woes of this rabble finally interested the weaker mem- 
bers of society, as usually happens; had the sect not been persecuted it would have 
faded away and never anymore been heard of. It is incredible that one such heap 
of impostures, atrocities, and gibberish could have held our forefathers spellbound 
for ages. When shall we become wise enough to be irrevocably and forever done 
with all this? 


760 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


twenty-two courtyards, and its gardens are vast. Let us have a 
look at this,’ said the Pope, leading me into a gallery above the 
vestibule of St. Peter’s basilica. ‘From here,” the Pontiff explained, 
“I shed my blessings upon the world; here, I excommunicate kings; 
here, I pronounce null and void the vows whereby princes hold 
nations in fee.” 

“Poor player, you strut upon no very solid stage whose 
foundations are absurd ty; philosophy shall bring all your little 
theater crashing down.” 

From thence we passed into the celebrated picture gallery. In 
all Europe there is no room longer, not even the gallery of the 
Louvre; none contains such fine paintings. While admiring the 
“Saint Peter of the Three Keys,” “Pontiff,” I said to Braschi, “‘an- 
other monument to your pride ?” 

“Tis an emblem,” the Pope explained, “of the unlimited 
power Gregory VII and Boniface VIII attributed to themselves.” 

“Holy Father,” said I to the old bishop, “surrender. these 
emblems, put a whip in your gatekeeper’s hand, bare your venerable 
ass for a beating, and summon in a painter, you'll at least have 
the merit of auguring trie.” 

We went next into the library laid out in the form of a T. In 
that library there were a great many cupboards, but few books on 
display. 

“Everything is false in your house,” I pointed out to Braschi; 
“you keep three out of four of these bookcases sealed shut lest it 
be seen they are empty. Deception and fraudulence are everywhere 
your motto.” 

Upon one of those shelves I found a manuscript of Terence 
where drawings of the masks to be worn by the actors precede 
each of the plays. As well, much to my satisfaction, I came across 
the original letters Henry VIII wrote to Anne Boleyn, the slut 
with whom he was in love and whom he married despite the Pope; 
memorable period of the Reformation in England. 

After this we traversed the gardens where groves of orange 
trees and myrtle were growing and fountains played. 

“The other part of the palace, and it is there our tour will 
end,” the Holy Father said to me, “‘is used as a preserve for lust- 


Juliette & 761 


objects in the one sex and in the other; they are lodged behind 
bars; some will appear at the supper I have promised you.” 

‘Ah, Braschi,” said I, full of enthusiasm, ‘‘so you keep things 
in cages, do you? I trust it is rather a hard life they lead? Do you 
whip a little?” 

“One inevitably becomes severe as one gets on in years,” good 
Braschi admitted; ‘“‘for a man of my age there is no sweeter 
pleasure; I confess that I prefer it to all the rest.” 

“If you whip it is because you are cruel: fustigation on the 
part of a libertine is but the vent he gives his ferocity; were he to 
dare, he would express it in other ways.” 

“Well, Juliette,” was the Holy Father’s pleasant reply, ‘I am 
sometimes very daring indeed, as you shall see, yes, as you shall 
most certainly see.” 

“My friend, let us not forget the treasures I am to examine. 
You must have gold, your greed is legendary; I share that vice and 
would fain plunge my hands into heaps of those gleaming, fresh- 
minted coins that are so agreeable to the touch and to the eye.” 

‘“‘We are not far from where they are stored,” said the Pope, 
leading me down an obscure passageway. We came to a small iron 
door, he opened it. ‘Everything the Holy See possesses is here,” 
my guide continued, ushering me into a vaulted chamber in the 
center of which were chests containing, in crowns and sequins, 
between fifty and sixty millions at the very most. “I am afraid I 
have spent more than I have contributed to the hoard. Sixtus V 
founded it as a testimonial to the stupidity of Christians.” 

“Tf there is to be nothing hereditary about your tiara,” said I, 
“you are great dupes to amass riches in this world; had I been in 
your place I would have dilapidated the funds long ago. Scatter 
money to your friends, multiply your pleasures, enjoy yourself 
without stint, far better that than to leave these sums to accumulate 
for the conquerors’ taking, since overthrown you shall be. Pontiff, 
I foretell it to you now, one free nation or several in confederacy, 
rid of monarchical impediment, shall attack and defeat you; 
grieved though you must be to hear it, know nevertheless that 
you are by all odds the last pope the Church of Rome is going to 
have. What’s to be taken from here ?” 


762 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘A thousand sequins.” 

‘‘A thousand sequins! The miserly beggar! Pope, there is a 
scale standing by, I'll fill my pockets and let’s see whether I cannot 
get out of here with three times my weight in gold; you can 
hardly pay a woman less who has merits like mine.” 

So saying I began to scoop up handfuls of coins. 

“Stay, my dear, you shall fatigue yourself to no purpose; 
instead, let me give you a certificate for, let us say, ten thousand 
sequins redeemable upon presentation to my treasurer.” 

“Such an act of generosity touches me very little,” said I, 
tis upon Venus you plice these stakes.” 

And as we were leaving that treasure room, the subdued light 
favoring my preconceived design, I succeeded in taking an imprint 
of the key with a bit of wax I had brought for that purpose; 
Braschi, occupied with his own thoughts, noticed nothing; and we 
retraced our steps to the apartment in which he had received me. 

“Juliette,” he said then, “although but one of your conditions 
has been fulfilled so far, you must be content with me; let us now 
see whether I shall be content with you.” 

And at this the lecher unties my skirt-strings.”” 

“But,” say I, ‘what of the rest?” 

“Since I kept my word on the first article, Juliette, you need 
not doubt that I shall do as much on the others.” 

The old rake alrezdy had me at his disposition; I was bent 
forward over a sofa while he, the droll fellow, one knee on the 
floor, was peering narrowly at what seemed to be of extreme 
interest to him. 

“It is superb,” he declared; “Albani spoke well of it to me, 
but I anticipated nothinz of this degree of superiority.” 


“cy 


27 My intimates know thar: throughout my Italian travels I was accompanied by 
a most attractive and engaging: woman; that simply out of lewd philosophic principle 
I introduced this person to the Tuscan Grand Duke, to the Vicar of Christ, to 
Princess Borghese, to their Royal Highnesses the King and Queen of Naples. They 
may therefore be perfectly certain that everything I say relating to the voluptuous 
side of the journey is authentic, that I have depicted nothing but the accustomed be- 
havior and characteristic attitides of the persons I mention, and that had they been 
witness to these scenes, they could not have rendered sincerer accounts of them. I take 
this occasion to assure the reader that the same applies to the descriptive part of 
my narrative; it is scrupulousl:; exact. 


Juliette 763 


The Pontiff’s kisses waxed gradually more ardent: his tongue 
thrilled here and there along the perimeter, then danced inside, 
and I saw one of his hands scurry toward the region of his 
debilitated manhood. I was all afire to see the prick of the Pope, 
I craned my head around but in that posture could make out 
nothing. 

“Tf,” said I, “you are willing to be disturbed for a moment 
we might arrange ourselves more conveniently and I will be able 
to facilitate your enterprise without in the least diverting your 
homage.” 

Then, helping him recline upon the sofa, I planted my behind 
over his face and leaned down to frig his member while with the 
hand not devoted to that chore I stroked his buttocks, then strove 
to arouse him anally. These divers occupations put me in position 
to analyze the Holy Father, and I shall describe him to you as 
best I can. 

Braschi is plump, his buttocks broad, chubby, but firm, so 
toughened, so calloused by the habit he has of receiving the scourge, 
that a knife-point would sooner penetrate walrus-hide; his asshole 
is slack and prodigiously wide, and how could it be otherwise in 
view of the twenty-five or thirty fuckings it ordinarily gets every 
day? His prick, once aloft, is not without beauty, it is lean, wiry, 
clears nicely at the tip, and is somewhere near eight inches long 
by six in circumference. Hardly had it reared itself ;when the papal 
passions received energetic expression: as His Holiness’ brow was 
wedged between my buttocks, first his teeth, then in short order 
his nails made themselves felt. So long as ’twas done in playful 
spirit I held my peace; but when Pius VI began to lose all sense 
of proportion, I turned around. 

“Braschi, with you I accept the accomplice’s role but I decline 
that of victim.” 

‘When I am hot and when I pay,” the Pope rejoined, “I am 
not much inclined to split hairs. Shit, Juliette, be a good girl and 
shit, that will calm me; I worship shit and my discharge is certain 
if you can supply me some.” 

It being within my power to gratify him, I return to my post; 
I push, I grunt, I shit; the pontifical prick hardens to such a point 
I believe it is about to discharge.

“Ready yourself, be quick,” cries the pig, “I am going to 
embugger you—”’ 

“No, you're not,” say I, “it will sap your strength, our 
nocturnal orgies will suffer from your thoughtlessness now.” 

“You are mistaken,” the Pope assures me, clinging fast to my 
two buttocks, “I frequently fuck thirty, forty asses without losing 
a drop of sperm. Into position, I tell you, bugger you I must, 
bugger you I shall.” 

What could I reply to that? He was a very determined man; 
this was confirmed by the state of his prick, at which I glanced 
again; I offered my ass; Braschi speared it dry and deep. This 
scraping whence resulted mingled pain and pleasure, the moral 
irritation resulting from the idea of holding the Pope’s prick in 
my ass, everything marched me toward happiness: I discharged. 
My bugger, sensing as much, hugged me frenziedly and drove me 
hard, he kissed me, he frigged me. But completely in control of his 
passions, the lecher roused them without giving them any final 
outlet; after a harrowin;: fifteen minutes he withdrew. 

“You are delicious,” he affirmed, “I have never fucked a 
more voluptuous ass. Let us dine. I shall give orders for the 
execution of the scene you wish to transpire on Saint Peter’s high 
altar; we shall repair to the basilica after our meal.” 

We were but two at table, and we conducted ourselves like 
perfect swine. For lewdress there are few people in this world who 
can compare with Braschi; there are none more schooled in the 
finer points of debauchery. His is a delicate stomach; he would 
not touch certain food until it had been prepared for eating, after 
wetting each morsel with my saliva I would feed it into his mouth, 
in my mouth were rinsed the wines he afterward drank, he some- 
times injected half a bottle of Tokay or sack into my fundament, 
then swallowed what I flushed forth and if by chance it included 
a mard or two, he would be in raptures. 

“Oh, Braschi!” I exclaimed during a moment of lucidity, 
“what would they say, the people upon whom you professionally 
impose, if they could sze you in the midst of these turpitudes ?” 

“They would express for me the same contempt I have for 
them,” Braschi answered, ‘‘and despite their pride they would 
own to their absurdity. But no matter! let’s continue to dazzle and 


Juliette & 765 


dupe them: the reign of error shall someday come to its end, we 
must enjoy it while it lasts.” 

‘“‘Why yes, yes indeed,” I concurred, “‘let us fuddle and fool 
mankind, it asks for no greater service. . . . Braschi, say now, shall 
we not immolate a few victims in the temple whither we are soon 
to go?” 

“Of course we shall,” the Holy Father replied, “blood must 
flow before orgies are satisfactory. Seated on Tiberius’ throne, I 
imitate his voluptuous practices; and I too know no more delicious 
discharge than that expelled in echo to the plaintive accents of th 
dying.” 

“Do you indulge often in those excesses ?” 

“Rarely do I let a day go by without plunging into them, 
Juliette, and never do I retire for the night with unbloodied hands.” 

“But from where does this monstrous taste come?” 

“From Nature, my child. Murder is one of her laws; whenever 
she feels the need for murder she inspires in us a longing to commit 
it, and willy-nilly we obey her. I shall shortly employ more vigorous 
arguments to demonstrate that this fancied crime is no crime at all; 
if you desire, I shall perform it. In an effort to accommodate their 
doctrine to conventional notions, ordinary philosophers have sub- 
mitted man to Nature; I am prepared to prove to you that man 
is in no wise dependent upon her.” 

“My friend,” said I, “I remind you of your promise: this dis- 
sertation is part of our bargain, pray fulfill it now, we have the 
time.” 

‘As you like,” said the mitred thinker; “I shall ask for your 
whole attention, the subject demands it. 

“Of all the extravagances into which man’s pride was to lead 
him, the most absurd was probably the precious case he dared 
make of his person. Surrounded by creatures worth as much and 
more than he, he nonetheless considered himself at liberty to make 
away with those beings which he fancied subordinate to him, the 
while believing that no penance, no punishment, could wipe clear 
the crime consisting in an attempt upon his own life. To the 
initial folly stemming from pride, to that revolting stupidity of 
considering he was sprung from some divinity, of supposing himself 
in possession of an immortal soul, to this atrocious blindness he 


” 


766 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


was doubtless obliged to add the other of esteeming his mortal 
self beyond price. Indeed, how could the beloved masterpiece of a 
bountiful divinity, how could heaven’s favorite have come to any 
other conclusion? the severest penalties had incontrovertibly to be 
prescribed for whoever should wreck such a splendid machine. 
This machine was sacred; a soul, the brilliant image of a yet more 
brilliant divinity, animated this construction whose destruction must 
be the most dreadful cr.me it would be possible to commit. And 
even as he reasoned thus, to appease his gluttony he roasted the 
lamb entire on a spit, he carved into pieces and boiled in a pot this 
gentle and peaceable lamb, a creature shaped by the same hand 
that shaped him, his inferior simply because differently built. How- 
ever, had he reflected a little he would have thought a great deal 
less highly of himself; a rather more philosophical glance cast at 
the Nature he misunderstood would have caused him to see that, 
a weak and ill-formed product of that blind mother’s manufacture, 
he resembled all other creatures, that his condition was bound 
inextricably to the condition of all others, necessitated like all the 
others’, and hence not one whit better than theirs. 

“No earthly creature is expressly formed by Nature, none 
deliberately made by her; all are the result of her laws and her 
workings, in such sort that, in a world constituted like ours, there 
had necessarily to be such creatures as we find here; very different 
creatures probably inhabit other globes, the myriads of globes 
wherewith space is freighted. But these creatures are neither good 
nor beautiful, precious nor created; they are the froth, they are the 
result of Nature’s unthinking operations, they are like vapors 
which rise up from the !iquid in a caldron that is rarefied by heat, 
whose action drives our the particles of air this liquid contains. 
This steam is not created, it is resultative, it is heterogeneous, it 
derives its existence from a foreign element and has in itself no 
intrinsic value; its being or not has no adverse effect upon the 
element it emanates from; to this element it adds nothing, owes 
nothing, this element owes nothing to it. Let some other vibration 
different from heat modify this element, it will continue to exist in 
its new modification, and the vapor which resulted from it before 
will cease to result from it now. Let Nature become subject to other 
laws, these creatures resulting from the present laws will exist no 


Juliette }» 767 


more under these different ones, but Nature will nonetheless still 
exist, although by different laws. 

‘‘Man thus has no relationship to Nature, nor Nature to man; 
Nature cannot bind man by any law, man is in no way dependent 
upon Nature, neither is answerable to the other, they cannot either 
harm or help each other; one has produced involuntarily—hence 
has no real relationship to her product; the other is involuntarily 
produced—hence has no real relationship to his producer. Once 
cast, man has nothing further to do with Nature; once Nature has 
cast him, her control over man ends; he is under the control of his 
own laws, laws that are inherent in him. With his casting man 
receives a direct and specific system of laws by which he must abide, 
under which he must proceed ever after; these laws are those of 
his personal self-preservation, of his multiplication, laws which re- 
fer to him, which are of him, laws which are uniquely his own, vital 
to him but in no way necessary to Nature, for he is no longer of 
Nature, no longer in her grip, he is separate from her. He is an 
entity entirely distinct from her ; of such little usefulness is he to her 
workings, of such little necessity to her combinations, that whether 
he were to quadruple his species or annihilate it totally, the uni- 
verse would not be in the slightest the worse for it. If man destroys 
himself, he does wrong—in his own eyes. But that is not the view 
Nature takes of the thing. As she sees it, if he multiplies he does 
wrong, for he usurps from Nature the honor of a new phenomenon, 
creatures being the necessary result of her workings. If those crea- 
tures that are cast were not to propagate themselves, she would 
cast new entities and enjoy a faculty she has ceased to be able to 
exercise. Not that she is unable to recover the use of that faculty, 
if she wished to have it, but she never does anything needlessly, 
and so long as the first series of beings propagate themselves by 
faculties inherent in them, she suspends propagation: our multipli- 
cation, only one of the laws inherent in us, is therefore decidedly 
detrimental to the phenomena whereof Nature is capable. 

“Thus, those that we regard as virtues become crimes from her 
point of view. Whereas, contrariwise, if creatures destroy one 
another, they do well as regards Nature; for no obligation to 
reproduce has been imposed upon them, they have simply received 
the faculty to reproduce; turning to destruction, they cease exer- 


768 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


cising it, and give Nature the opportunity to resume the propaga- 
tion from which she refrained so long as it was needless. You may 
perhaps object that if this possibility of propagation she has left 
her creatures were detr:mental to her, she would not have be- 
stowed it in the first place. But observe that she has no choice in 
these matters, that she is bound by her laws, that she cannot alter 
them, that one of her laws is the casting of creatures which are cast 
at a single stroke and emerge such as they must remain, and that 
another of her laws is that her creatures be invested with the possi- 
bility to propagate themselves. Observe as well that were .these 
creatures to cease propayating, or to destroy themselves, Nature’s 
original rights, contested hitherto, would be restored to her; 
whereas in propagating, or in not destroying, we confine her to her 
secondary functions and deprive her of her primary powers. Thus, 
all the laws we humans have made, whether to encourage popula- 
tion or to prevent its destruction, necessarily conflict with all of 
hers: and every time we act in accordance with our laws, we di- 
rectly thwart her desires; but, reversibly, every time we either 
stubbornly refuse to urdertake the propagation she abhors, or 
cooperate in the murders which delight her and which serve her, we 
are sure to please her, certain of acting in harmony with her wishes. 
Ah, does she leave us in any doubt of the point to which our in- 
crease inconveniences her? can we not tell how eager she would be 
to halt our multiplication and be delivered of its ill effects? Is all 
this not proven by the disasters she sends to harry us, by the di- 
visions and discords she sows in our midst, by the thirst for murder 
she constantly inspires in us? These wars, these famines she hurls 
at us, these pestilences she now and again looses with the aim of 
wiping us off the face of the earth, these great villains she fabricates 
in profusion, these Alexanders, these Tamurlanes, these Ghengis 
Khans, all these heroes who lay the world waste, by these tokens, I 
say, does she not plainly demonstrate that all our laws are contrary 
to hers, and that her purpose is to destroy them? Thus it is that 
these murders our laws 9unish so sternly, these murders we suppose 
the greatest outrage that can be inflicted upon Nature, not only, as 
you very well see, do her no hurt and can do her none, but are in 
some sort instrumental to her, since she is a great murderess herself 
and since her single reason for murdering is to obtain, from the 


Juliette 2» 769 


wholesale annihilation of cast creatures, the chance to recast them 
anew. The most wicked individual on earth, the most abominable, 
the most ferocious, the most barbarous, and the most indefatigable 
murderer is therefore but the spokesman of her desires, the vehicle 
of her will, and the surest agent of her caprices. 

“Let us go further. This murderer thinks he destroys, he 
thinks he consumes, and these beliefs sometimes engender remorse 
in his heart; let us put him confidently at ease, and if the system I 
have just developed is a little beyond his reach, let us prove to him 
from what happens before his very eyes that he has not even the 
honor of destroying; that the annihilation upon which he flatters 
himself when in sound health, or at which he shudders when he is 
sick, is no annihilation at all, and that annihilation is unfortunately 
something he cannot possibly achieve. 

“The invisible chain which links all physical beings together, 
the absolute interdependence of the three kingdoms, animal, min- 
eral, and vegetable, proves that all three are in the same case as 
regards Nature, that all three are resultant from her primary laws, 
but neither created nor necessary. These kingdoms are governed 
by the same laws. All three mechanically reproduce and destroy 
themselves, because all three are composed of the same elements, 
which sometimes combine in one fashion, sometimes in another; but 
these laws and workings are distinct from Nature’s laws and work- 
ings, and independent of them; upon the three kingdoms she acted 
only once, she cast them, cast them once and for all; since having 
been cast they have acted on their own; they have acted according 
to their own laws, the foremost of these being a perpetual 
metempsychosis, a perpetual variation, a perpetual permutation 
embracing all three in a perpetual movement. 

“In all living beings the principle of life is no other than that 
of death: at the same time we receive the one we receive the other, 
we nourish both within us, side by side. At the instant we call death, 
everything seems to dissolve; we are led to think so by the excessive 
change that appears to have been brought about in this portion of 
matter which no longer seems animate. But this death is only 
imaginary, it exists figuratively but in no other way. Matter, de- 
prived of the other portion of matter which communicated move- 
ment to it, is not destroyed for that; it merely abandons its form, 


770 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it decays—and in decaying proves that it is not inert; it enriches 
the soil, fertilizes it, and serves in the regeneration of the other 
kingdoms as well as of its own. There is, in the final analysis, no 
essential difference between this first life we receive and this second, 
which is the one we call death. For the first is caused by a forming 
of some of the matter which renews and reorganizes itself within 
the entrails of mother earth. Thus does exhausted matter re-enter 
the regenerating womb, there to refertilize particles of ethereal 
matter which, but for it, would remain in their apparent inertia. 
And there, in brief, is the whole science of the laws of these three 
kingdoms, laws which exist apart from Nature, independently of 
her, laws which they received at their first emergence into being, 
laws which thwart this Nature’s will to erupt anew; there, in brief, 
are the sole means through which the laws inherent in these king- 
doms operate. The first generation, which we call life, is as it were 
an example. Only from exhaustion do its laws become operative; 
only through destruction are these laws transmitted; the former 
requires a kind of corrupted matter, the latter, petrified matter. 
And there is the sole cause of this immensity of successive creations: 
each of them consists 0% a repetition of the first principles of ex- 
haustion or of destruction, which shows you that death is as 
necessary as life, that there is indeed no real death, and that all the 
plagues we have just spoken of, all the cruelties of tyrants, the 
crimes of the wicked, zre as necessary to the laws of the three 
kingdoms as the action which revivifies them; that when Nature 
sends them forth upon the earth, with the intention of annihilating 
these kingdoms which prevent her from using her faculty for cast- 
ing new creatures, she acts from sheer impotence, because the first 
laws received by these kingdoms at the time of their first casting 
engraved the reproductive faculty in them forever, and this, Nature 
could erase only by destroying her own self, which she is powerless 
to do, because she is herself subject to laws from whose authority 
she cannot possibly escape, and which shall last eternally. Thus, 
through his murderings the wicked man not only aids Nature to 
attain ends she will nonetheless never entirely achieve, but also 
aids even the laws the three kingdoms received at their original 
casting. I say original casting to facilitate the intelligence of my 
system, for, there never having been any creation and Nature being 


Juliette 2 771 


timeless, the first casting of a given being endures so long as that 
being’s line survives; and would end were that line to be extin- 
guished; the extinction of all beings would make room for the new 
castings Nature desires; to this end the one means is total destruc- 
tion, and that is the result toward which crime strives. Whence it 
comes out certainly that the criminal who could smite down the 
three kingdoms all at once by annihilating both them and their 
capacity to reproduce would be he who serves Nature best. Now 
look again at your legislations in the light of this startling truth, 
and sce how just they be. 

“No destruction, no fodder for the earth, and consequently 
man deprived of the possibility to reproduce man. Fatal truth, this, 
since it contains inescapable proof that the virtues and vices of our 
social system are nought, and that what we characterize as vices are 
more beneficial, more necessary than our virtues, since these vices 
are creative and these virtues merely created; or, if you prefer, 
these vices are causes, these virtues only effects; proof that a too 
perfect harmony would have more disadvantages than has dis- 
order; and proof that if war, discord, and crime were suddenly to 
be banished from the world, the three kingdoms, all checks upon 
them removed, would so flourish as to unsettle and soon destroy all 
the other laws of Nature. Celestial bodies would come all to a halt, 
their influences would be suspended because of the overly great 
empire of one of their number; gravitation would be no more, and 
motion none. It is then the crimes of man which, stemming the rise 
of the three kingdoms, counteracting their tendency to preponder- 
ate, prevent their importance from becoming such as must disrupt 
all else, and maintains in universal affairs that perfect equilibrium 
Horace called rerum concordia discors. Therefor is crime necessary 
in the world. But the most useful crimes are without doubt those 
which most disrupt, such as refusal to propagate and destruction, 
all the others are petty mischief, they are less even than that, or 
rather only those two merit the name of crime: and thus you see 
these crimes essential to the laws of the kingdoms, and essential to 
the laws of Nature. An ancient philosopher called war the mother 
of all things. The existence of murderers is as necessary as that 
bane; but for them, all would be disturbed in the order of things. It 
is therefore absurd to blame or punish them, more ridiculous still 


772 ch THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to fret over the very natural inclinations which lead us to commit 
this act in spite of ourselves, for never will too many or enough 
murders be committed on earth, considering the burning thirst 
Nature has for them. Ah, unhappy mortal! boast not that thou art 
able to destroy, it is something far beyond thy forces; thou canst 
alter forms, thou art helpless to annihilate them; of the substance 
of Nature, not by one grain can thou lessen its mass, how wouldst 
thou destroy since all that is, is eternal ? Thou changest the forms 
of things, vary those forms thou may, but this dissolution benefits 
Nature, since ’tis these disassembled parts she recomposes. Thus 
does all change effected by man upon organized matter far more 
serve Nature than it displeases her. What is this I say? Alas! to 
render her true service would require destructions more thorough, 
vaster than any it is in our power to operate; ’tis atrocity, ’tis scope 
she wants in crimes; the more our destroying is of a broad and 
atrocious kind, the more agreeable it is to her. To serve her better 
yet, one would have to be able to prevent the regeneration resultant 
from the corpses we bury. Only of his first life does murder deprive 
the individual we smite; one would have to be able to wrest away 
his second, if one were to be more useful to Nature; for ‘tis anni- 
hilation she seeks, by less she is not fully satisfied, it is not within 
our power to extend our murders to the point she desires. 

“Oh, Juliette, bear it ever in mind that there is no real de- 
struction, that death is itself nothing of the sort, that, physically 
and philosophically viewed, it is only a further modification of the 
matter in which the active principle or, if you like, the principle of 
motion, acts without interruption, although in a less apparent 
manner. Thus a man’s birth is no more the commencement of his 
existence than his death is its cessation; and the mother who bears 
him no more gives him life than the murderer who kills him gives 
him death; the former produces some matter organized in a cer- 
tain way, the latter provides the occasion for the renascence of 
some different matter; and both create. 

“Nothing is essentially born, nothing essentially perishes, all 
is but the action and reaction of matter; all is like the ocean 
billows which ever rise and fall, like the tides of the sea, ebbing 
and flowing endlessly, without there being either the loss or the 
gain of a drop in the volume of the waters; all this is a perpetual 


Juliette & 773 


flux which ever was and shall always be, and whereof we become, 
though we know it not, the principal agents by reason of our vices 
and our virtues. All this is an infinite variation; a thousand 
thousand different portions of matter which appear under every 
form are shattered, are reconstituted to appear again under others, 
again to be undone and to rearise. The principle of life is but the 
result of the four elements in combination; with death, the com- 
bination dissolves, each element returning entire into its own sphere, 
ready to enter new combinations when the laws of the kingdoms 
summon them forth; it is only the whole that changes form, the 
parts remain intact, and from these parts joined anew to the whole, 
new beings are forever being recomposed. But the principle of life, 
uniquely the fruit of the combining of elements, does not exist by 
itself, only through this union does it exist and it changes entirely 
when this union ceases, becomes more or less perfect depending 
upon the new work created out of the debris of the old. Now, as 
these beings are both completely indifferent one to the other, and 
completely indifferent not only to Nature but to the laws of the 
kingdoms also, the changes I make in the modifications of matter 
can be of no importance: of what importance is it if, as Montes- 
quieu says, I make a round lump of something into a square lump; 
what can it matter if of a man I make a cabbage, a lettuce, a 
butterfly, or a worm; in this I do nothing but exercise the right I 
have been given to do it, and if I wish, if I can, I may thus trouble 
or destroy all beings without being able to say that I have acted 
contrary to the laws of the three kingdoms and consequently to 
the laws of Nature. Far from it; I serve those laws one and all; I 
serve the three kingdoms in giving the earth the nutriment which 
facilitates her other productions, which is indispensable to them, 
and without which her productions would be at an end; I serve 
Nature’s laws in acting in consonance with the aims of perpetual 
destruction Nature announces, and whose purpose is to enable her 
to develop new castings, the faculty wherefor is suspended in her 
owing to the continuing presence of what she has cast before. 
‘Are you able to believe that this blade of grass, this mite, 
this maggot, into which the body I slew has latterly metamor- 
phosed, is of more or less outstanding importance to the laws of 
the three kingdoms which, embracing them all three, can have a 


774 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


predilection for none? Shall it be in the eyes of Nature, who vomits 
forth her castings indiscriminately, that some one production or 
other of these castings shall attain to exceptional value? This 
would be tantamount to upholding that of the millions of leaves 
growing upon this aged oak tree one of them is the darling of the 
trunk, because it is perhaps a little larger than its neighbors. ‘It is 
our pride,’ Montesquieu continues, ‘which prevents us from sensing 
our puniness and which, puny as we are, causes us to want to be 
taken account of in the world, to be of mention there, to be a figure 
of note in it. We are wont to fancy that the loss of such a perfect 
being as we would be ruinous to Nature, and we do not conceive 
that one man the more in the world, or the less, or all mankind, 
or one hundred million earths like ours and each full of men, are 
but subtle atoms, very tiny and indifferent to Nature.’ So rend 
away, hack and hew, torment, break, wreck, massacre, burn, grind 
to dust, melt, in a word: reshape into however many forms all the 
productions of the three kingdoms, and you simply shall have done 
them so many services, vou shall have done nothing but be useful 
to them. You shall have been the minion of their laws, you shall 
have executed those of Nature, because we are creatures of too 
little strength and too narrow possibilities ever to cooperate in 
anything but the general order of things, and what you call dis- 
order is nothing else than one of the laws of the order you com- 
prehend not and which you have erroneously named disorder be- 
cause its effects, though good for Nature, run counter to your con- 
venience or jar your opinions. Ah, if these crimes were not necessary 
to the general economy, would they be, as they are, inspired in us? 
Would we in the depths of our hearts sense both the need to commit 
them and the charm of having committed them? How dare we 
think that Nature could instill in us impulses which cross her pur- 
poses? Eh, indeed, we may rather believe this: that she took all 
good care to place well 2utside our reach the power to do anything 
that might really discomfort or harm her. Come, little girl, let us 
try to drink dry of its rays the sun that lights our world, let us try 
to alter the stars’ rhythmed march, reverse the flight of heavenly 
bodies in space; aye, those are crimes that would veritably offend 
Nature; and Nature has seen to it that we shall never commit them. 
As for what she has put in our power to do, we have thereby her 


Juliette 2 775 


authorization to do it; all that is inside our grasp is ours to have; 
let us tamper with it, destroy it, change it without fear of harming 
her. Let us be rather persuaded that we are aiding her, and that 
the more we turn our hands to deeds of the species we improperly 
term criminal, the better servants to her we are. 

“But would there not be some substantial difference between 
one species of crime and another, and may there not be murders so 
base, so heinous as might be revolting to Nature? What an idea! 
What stupidity to entertain it even for a moment! This person 
upon whom our human conventions shed an aura of sanctity, can he 
be of superior worth in Nature’s eyes? In what way can the body 
of your father, of your mother, of your sister outyalue, in Nature’s 
consideration, that of your slave? Such distinctions cannot exist for 
her; she does not even perceive them; she cannot possibly perceive 
them; and this body, so precious according to your laws, will 
metamorphose itself just as surely as the body of that helot you so 
thoroughly despise. Arm yourself in the knowledge that the atroc- 
ity you dread pleases her.; she would have you inject an ever greater 
dose of atrocity in those that you call your destructions, that you 
become an intransigent opponent of any reproduction is her wish, 
her greatest expectation of you, that you annihilate the three king- 
doms: this you cannot do; why then, if the atrocity she desires of 
you cannot attain the farther target she sets you, turn it upon the 
nearer and you shall have satisfied her to the best of your abilities. 
Unable to please her by the atrocity of a global destruction, at 
least provide her the pleasure of local atrocity, and into your 
murderings put every imaginable foulness and horror, thereby 
showing utmost docility in your compliance with the laws she im- 
poses upon you; your inability to do all she wants does not exempt 
you from doing all you can. 

“From the foregoing it would clearly appear that infanticide 
fits in closest with her designs because it severs the chain of pro- 
geniture, it consigns the greatest number of seeds to the tomb. In 
killing his father the son breaks nothing, he removes the uppermost 
link of the chain; when the father kills his son he prevents further 
links from ever being added thereunto; the line is doomed; it is 
not doomed by the son’s destroying the father, for the son remains, 
and in him lives the future of the line. Either children or young 


776 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


mothers, preferably when they are pregnant, these are the two 
murders which best answer the aim of the kingdom and above all 
of Nature, ’tis in that direction everybody should exert himself 
if he wishes to please the harsh dam of humankind.”8 

“Ah, do we not see, do we not sense that atrocity in crime 
pleases Nature, since tis according to this factor alone she regu- 
lates the amount of delight to provide us when we commit a crime. 
The more frightful it is, the more we enjoy it; the blacker, the 
fouler it is, the more we are thrilled by it. Thus it is that an 
inexplicable Nature asks for viciousness, for vileness, for atrocious- 
ness in the deed she prompts us to, she wants us to adorn it with 
the same features she puts into the banes and plagues wherewith 
she besets us: so let us proceed fearlessly, imaginatively, let us 
set all scruples and bars aside, let us scorn humanity’s vain laws, 
the idiotic institutions which prisoner us. Let us heed none but 
Nature’s sacred voice, full certain that its instructions will always 
contradict the absurd principles of human morality and of infamous 
civilization. Do you then think civilization or morals have made 
men better? Imagine no such thing, take care not to suppose it; 
the one and the other have served only to soften man, to obscure 
in him the laws of Nature who made him free and cruel; alienated 
from her, the entire species sank straight into degradation, its 
ferocity changed into cunning, and ever since then the insidious 
evil man has done has only become more dangerous to his fellows. 
Since commit this evil ae must, since it is necessary, since it is 
agreeable to Nature, let us leave man to commit it in the manner 
most satisfying to him, and let us prefer him fierce to treacherous, 
the peril is less. 

“Let us not tire to repeat it: never has any intelligent nation 
presumed to erect murder into a crime: in order that murder be 


28 Nearly all the world’s peoples have enjoyed the right of life and death over 
their offspring. This right is perfectly natural; and of what may one better dispose 
than of what one has given? If there could be gradations of the alleged crime of 
murder, that is, if one could rank in their order of greater or lesser evil, things which 
contain none, infanticide would surely stand at the bottom of the scale: the prompt 
facility every man possesses to repair this trifling misdemeanor entirely effaces the 
little amount of badness in it. From a narrow study of Nature one finds that our 
first instinctive urge is to destroy our issue, and destroyed it would infallibly be if 
pride did not often advocate sparing it. 


Juliette & 777 


crime one must admit the possibility of destruction, an altogether 
unacceptable proposition, we have just agreed to that. Once again: 
murder is nothing more than a formal variation resulting in no 
loss” whatsoever to the law of the three kingdoms nor to the law 
of Nature, but redounding prodigiously to their benefit. And why 
punish a man for restoring a little ahead of time a portion of matter 
which is destined to the elements anyhow, and which, as soon as 
it returns to them, these same elements employ in new composi- 
tions: the sooner you kill that fly, the sooner we will have back a 
pasha, do you prefer to spare a cockroach and forego an arch- 
bishop? There is then nothing wrong or bad in restoring to the 
elements the means to recompose a thousand insects at the expense 
of a few ounces of blood diverted out of its usual canals, in a 
somewhat larger species of animal conventionally known as man. 

“Murderers, to be brief, are in Nature as are war, famine, 
and cholera; they are one of the means Nature disposes of, like 
all the hostile forces she pits against us. Thus when one ventures 
the statement that an assassin offends Nature, the absurdity one 
utters is as great as though one were to declare that cholera, 
famine, or war irritates Nature or commits crimes; it is exactly 
the same thing. But we cannot flog or burn or brand or hang 
cholera or famine, whereas we can do all of these to a man: that is 
why he is wrong. You will almost always find wrongs measured 
not by the size of the offense, but by the vulnerability of the ag- 
gressor; and there is your explanation for why wealth and posi- 
tion are always right, and indigence is always at fault. 


29 Regeneration or, better still, transformation is the term we ought to use for 
this change we see take place in matter; it is neither depleted, nor wasted, nor 
spoiled, nor corrupted by the different forms it assumes; and one of the main causes 
of its durability and vigor may perhaps consist in the seeming destructions which 
subtilize it, accord it greater freedom to form fresh miracles. Matter, in fine, does 
not destroy itself to change from and assume new modification, any more than does, 
as Voltaire says (and it is from him this note is extracted), a cube of wax you melt 
into a round puddle smash in changing shape. Nothing less out of the ordinary than 
these perpetual resurrections, and there is nothing stranger in being born twice than 
once. Wherever you bend your glance in the world, you encounter resurrection: 
caterpillars resuscitate as butterflies, an crange pip you plant resuscitates as an 
orange tree, all the animals buried in the ground resuscitate as grass, as potatoes, as 
worms, and nourish other animals whereof they rapidly form part of the substance, 
etc., etc., ete. 


778 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“As concerns the cruelty which leads to murder, we may 
confidently submit that it is one of man’s most natural dispositions ; 
it is one of the sweetest penchants, one of the keenest he has 
received from Nature; cruelty in man is simply an expression of 
his desire to exercise his strength. It pervades all his deeds, all 
his words, all his behavior; education disguises it sometimes, but 
it is quick to reappear. ]t then manifests itself under all kinds of 
forms. The violent throbbings it causes us to feel, either at the 
idea or upon the execution of the crime cruelty suggests to us, 
are invincible proof that we are born to serve as blind instruments 
to the kingdoms’ laws as well as to Nature’s, and that once we 
lend ourselves to do their bidding, voluptuousness invades us 
through every pore. 

“So reward him, this murderer, employ instead of punishing 
him; remember that there is no crime, of whatever slight impor- 
tance in itself, that does not however demand as much strength 
and energy, as much courage and philosophy, as the grand crime 
of murder. There are z. thousand cases in which an enlightened 
government ought only to use assassins. .. . Juliette, he who knows 
how to stifle the cries of his conscience to the point of making a 
game of the lives of others, this man already has the stuff qualify- 
ing him for the very greatest undertakings. There are heaven 
knows how many people in the world who turn criminal on their 
own account simply because an undiscerning government ignores 
their worth and neglects to put them to work; the result is that 
the unlucky souls are broken on the wheel for plying the same 
trade in which they might otherwise have got themselves covered 
with renown and honor. The Alexanders, the:Saxes, the Turennes 
might perhaps have become highway robbers had distinguished 
birth and smiling fortune not readied them for laurels in the career 
of glory; while assuredly the Cartouches, the Mandrins, and 
Desrues would have become great men had the government known 
how to employ them. 

“Oh, height of fearful injustice! wild animals may exist, such 
as the lion, the wolf, the tiger who live from murdering alone; in 
so living these animals disobey no laws, and there are other 
animals to be met with in the world who, to satisfy another passion 


Juliette 779 


than hunger, indulge in the same excesses—and these other animals, 
so it is claimed, commit crimes! 

“‘We often complain of the existence of such and such a beast 
whose form or aspect is offensive to our eyes, or which causes us 
some nuisance or other, and we console ourselves by saying, rightly 
and with common sense, ‘Tis a dreadful-looking creature, a harm- 
ful one too, but it is useful; Nature has created nothing in vain; 
this animal probably breathes a certain air that would poison us, 
or else it eats insects of still greater danger to us.’ Let us be equally 
philosophical in every other regard, and in the murderer see 
nought but a hand guided by irresistible laws, a hand that ministers 
to Nature and which, through the crimes it accomplishes, of what- 
ever sort you wish to suppose them, acts at the behest of certain 
intentions unknown to us, or prevents some accident perhaps a 
thousand times more to be deplored than the one it occasions. 

‘““‘Sophistry! Nothing but sophistry!’ fools shrill at this 
point; ‘it is true that murder offends Nature, that he who has just 
committed it will shudder for the rest of his life at what he has 
done.’ Imbeciles. ’Tis not because the deed is bad in itself that the 
murderer shudders, for be certain of it, in those countries where 
murder is recompensed he shudders not. . . . Does the warrior 
shudder over the enemy he has just felled? The sole cause of the 
uneasiness we feel after the deed lies in its prohibition; every man 
has sometime in his life, before a perfectly commonplace action 
which circumstances happen to forbid, sensed all the terror he 
could possibly know from rendering himself guilty of that action. 
A sign is nailed over a door, saying it is forbidden to trespass here: 
no matter who he is who makes up his mind to go in will do so 
with a kind of shudder, and yet this thing he does is not evil. It is 
thus from nothing but the prohibition that the terror is born, 
and not at all from the action itself which, as we see, may inspire 
the same fear though there be nothing criminal to it. This pusil- 
lanimity which accompanies the murder, this little moment of 
fright, derives infinitely more from prejudice than from the kind 
of deed at hand. However, let the wind blow in another direction 
for a month, let the sword of Justice smite what you call virtue 
for a while, and let the laws reward crime: you'll see the virtuous 


780 e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


quaking and the wicked serene as they both go about acquitting 
themselves of their favorite deeds. In these matters Nature is 
silent; the voice that thunders inside us belongs to the prejudice 
which with a little effort and determination we can quell forever. 
There is however a sacred organ whose intimate murmur used to 
resound in us before the voices of error or of education made 
themselves heard; but tiis other voice, which reminds us of our 
bondage to the elements, constrains us only to that which favors 
the harmonious accord of these elements, and their combinations 
modified after the forms which these same elements employ in 
composing us. However, this last-named voice is not strident, nor 
theatrical, it dins no knowledge of God into us, makes no mention 
of consanguinary or social duties, for these things are false and 
it speaks the truth only. Neither does it tell us not to do unto 
others that which unto our own selves we would not that there 
be done; if we care to listen closely to it, tis quite the opposite 
message we will hear. 

“Be ever mindful,’ Nature says to us instead, ‘be ever mind- 
ful that all which thou wouldst not have done unto thyself, being 
the grave harm done a neighbor whence there is much profit to be 
had, is precisely that which thou must do to be happy; for it is 
writ in my laws that ye all destroy yourselves mutually; and the 
true way to succeed therein is to harm thy neighbor without stint 
or cease. Whence it cometh that I have placed the sharpest bent 
for crime in thee; whence it is that my intention be that thou 
render thyself happy, at the expense of whosoever it be. Let thy 
father, thy mother, thy son, thy daughter, thy niece, thy wife, thy 
sister, thy friend be no dearer to thee than the lowliest worm that 
crawleth on the face of the earth; for bonds, duties, allegiances, 
affections, none of these hath ever been had from me, they were 
wrought by thy weakness only, by thy education, and by thy folly; 
they concern me not nor interest me at all; thou mayst violate 
them, break them, loathe them, annul them; ’tis all one to me. 
I cast thee into being as I cast the ox, the ass, the artichoke, the 
louse; to them all I gave faculties, some of greater, some of lesser 
proportions; use what are thine; once gone forth out of my bosom, 
thou canst touch me no more, whatever thou doest. If thou keepest 
thee safe and increase, thou shalt do well as regards thyself; if 


Juliette & 781 


thou dost destroy thyself and others, nay, if thou contrivest, using 
such capacities as thou hast, to lay the three kingdoms waste and 
to devastate them so there shall be nothing left, ’tis there some- 
thing whereat I shall be pleased beyond measure; for I in my turn 
shall use the fairest attribute of my power, that which is my ability 
to create, to make beings anew—which thy accursed progeniture 
hinders me from doing. Cease to engender, destroy absolutely all 
that exists, thou shalt disturb not the slightest thing in my scheme 
or workings. But whether ye destroy or create, the two be nearly 
the same in my eyes, whichever way thou wouldst proceed, I 
benefit from thy doings, nothing is lost in my domain: the leaf 
that falls from the shrub is as useful to me as the cedars that 
forest Lebanon, and the rot-spawned worm is of no less nor more 
considerable value in my eyes than the mightiest king on earth. 
So form or destroy as thou wilt and at thy ease; tomorrow’s sun 
shall rise just the same, all the globes I hang and guide in space 
shall hold nonetheless firm in their orbits; and if thou dost destroy 
all, as these three kingdoms annihilated by thy wickedness are 
the necessary results of my combinations and as I form nothing 
anymore, because these kingdoms are created with the faculty 
of reproducing themselves mutually; smitten by thy traitorous 
hand, they shall be re-formed by me, I shall cast them again and 
it shall be on earth as it was before. The vastest, the profoundest, 
the most atrocious of thy crimes shall thus only have pleased me.’ 

“Such are the laws of Nature, Juliette; such are the only laws 
she has ever dictated, the only ones which are precious to her, the 
only ones we should never transgress. If man makes other laws, 
we may deplore his stupidity, but we must never let it be binding 
upon us; we may fear becoming the victim of his absurd laws, but 
let us not violate them any the less; and, free of all prejudices, 
directly we can do so with impunity, let us seize every opportunity 
to revenge ourselves for the odious constraint of his laws by 
perpetrating the most signal outrages. Regret nothing but that we 
are unable to do enough, lament nothing but the weakness of the 
faculties we have received for our share and whose ridiculous 
limitations so cramp our penchants. And far from thanking this 
illogical Nature for the slender freedom she allows us for accom- 
plishing the desires she inspires in us, let us curse her from the 


782 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


bottom of our heart for so restricting the career which fulfills her 
aims; let us outrage her, let us abominate her for having left us 
so few wicked things to do, and then giving us such violent urges 
to commit crimes without measure or pause. 

‘““‘O Thou,’ so should we speak to her, “Thou, unreasoning 
and reasonless force of which I find myself the involuntary result, 
Thou who hurled me into this world with the desire that I offend 
Thee, and who hast however denied me the means so to do, inspire 
in my blazing soul some crimes which would serve Thee better 
than these poor melancholy things Thou hast put inside my reach. 
I would obey Thy laws, since they require horrors of me and for 
horrors I have a fiery thirst; but provide me better to do than 
Thy debility has given me so far. When I have exterminated all 
the creatures that cover the earth, still shall I be far from my 
mark, since I shall have merely served Thee, O unkind Mother, 
for it is to vengeance I aspire, vengeance for what, whether 
through stupidity or malice, Thou doest to men in never furnishing 
them the means to translate fairly into deeds the appalling 
desires Thou dost ever rouse in them.’ 

“And now, Juliette,” continued the Pontiff, “I believe I shall 
present to you some examples such as will prove to you that in 
all ages and everywhere, man has placed his delight in destroying, 
and Nature hers in permitting it. 

“At Capodimonte, if a woman gives birth to twins, her 
husband strangles one of the infants on the spot. 

“Everybody knows the case the Arabs and Chinese make of 
their children. Hardly half the number born are kept; they kill, 
burn, or drown the rest, and principally the females. The same 
horror of offspring prevails in Formosa. 

“The Mexicans never set out on a military expedition without 
first sacrificing children of the one sex or the other. 

“Japanese women are allowed to procure abortions as fre- 
quently as they like; no one holds them to account for the fruit 
they are unwilling to bear. 


30 The penalty decreed against child-murdering mothers is an unexampled 
atrocity. Who then has a greater right to dispose of this fruit than she who carries 
it in her womb? If in all the world there is an article of property to which no out- 
side claim can be fair, it is surely this one. To interfere with the usage a woman 


Juliette dh 783 


“The king of Calicut has in his palace an armchair of iron, 
beneath which he lights a great fire; in it, on certain festival days, 
a child is made fast, and it remains seated until it has been 
reduced to cinders. 

‘“‘Never was murder punished by death among the Romans; 
and for a long time the emperors in this regard followed Sulla’s 
law, which merely condemns the murderer to a fine. 

“On Mindanao this same crime is honored; he who commits 
it is sure, after producing proof of the deed, of being raised to the 
rank of a brave, with the right to wear a red ribbon. 

“Among the Caraguos the same honor is obtained by the 
quantity of murders alone: it takes the killing of seven men before 
one is entitled to the red turban. 

“On the banks of the Orinoco, mothers drown their daughters 
the moment they see the light. 

“In the kingdom of Zopit and in Trapobania, fathers cut 
the throats of children of whichever sex, once they grow weary 
of the sight of them or when these children begin to take on airs. 

“In Madagascar all infants born on Tuesdays, Thursdays, 
and Fridays are abandoned to wild beasts by their own parents. 

“Up until the Empire removed to the East, a Roman child 
of whatever age who displeased his father would be put to death 
by him. 

“Several chapters in the Pentateuch clearly show that fathers 
had the right of life or death over their children.

a father to kill his son and even his daughter when they reached 
marriageable age.

Gauls. 


chooses to make of it is stupidity carried beyond any conceivable extreme. Indeed, 
one must set a very high price by the human species to punish an unhappy creature, 
simply because she has not been concerned to double her existence nor eager to 
confirm the gift she unwillingly prepared. And what a curious calculation it is, this 
that leads to sacrificing the mother to the child! The crime committed, there is one 
creature the less on earth; the crime punished, now there are two. How clever one 
must be to reckon thus! And how intelligent our lawmakers are! And we allow 
such laws to remain in force! And we have the simple good-naturedness not to 
obliterate them along with the memory of the witty rogues who made them! 


784 <ls THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“To his subjects Czar Peter of the Russias addressed a 
public declaration the gist of which was that, by all laws human 
and divine, a father had the right of life and death over his 
children, without appeal and to be exercised without any per- 
mission, on the spur of the moment. No sooner had he published his 
decree than Peter proceeded to act according to it. 

‘The Galla chief, as soon as he is elected, must distinguish 
himself by an incursion into Abyssinia; ’tis the multiplicity of his 
crimes which renders him worthy of his post. He must plunder, 
rape, mutilate, massacre, burn; the more appalling his exploits, 
the more he is honored. 

“Each year the Egyptians sacrificed a young maiden to the 
Nile. When compassion gripped their hearts and they decided to 
interrupt this usage, the river’s fertilizing floods ceased and Egypt 
faced famine. 

‘So long as human sacrifices comprise a spectacle they ought 
never to be forbidden in a warlike society. Rome was mistress of 
the world all the while she had these cruel spectacles; she sank 
into decline and from there into slavery as soon as Christian 
morals managed to persuade her that there was more wrong in 
watching men slaughtered than beasts. But it was not humane 
sentiment that stood beiind the arguments of Christ’s followers, 
it was their great fear lest, were the star of idolatry to rise again 
over the Empire, they themselves might be sacrificed during 
their adversaries’ amusements. That is why the rascals preached 
charity, that is why they fabricated the ridiculous myth of brother- 
hood, which I know, Juliette, others must surely have exploded to 
your satisfaction. What I have just advanced accounts for every- 
thing in this fine ethic which even the enemies of this pernicious 
religion have been timid enough and mad enough to respect. We 
continue. 

‘Almost all the savages of America kill their elders when the 
latter are seen to be ailing; ’tis a kindly act on the part of the son; 
the father curses him if he does not dispatch him when he becomes 
aged and helpless. 

“In the South Seas there exists an island where women are 
killed once they have passed the age for engendering, as creatures

henceforth useless to the world; and as a matter of fact, what 
more are they good for then? 

“The peoples of the Barbary States have no law against the 
murder of their wives or their slaves; they are fully and authenti- 
cally masters thereof. 

“In no Asian harem is killing of the women outlawed; who- 
ever murders his own down to the last has simply to purchase 
some more. 

“Tt is an article of faith, on the island of Borneo, that all 
those persons a man kills will be his slaves in the next world; and 
as a result, the better a man wishes to be served after his death, 
the more he kills during his life. 

“When the Tartars of exotic Karaskan espy a foreigner 
who has wit, riches, and fair looks, they kill him in order to 
appropriate his qualities to themselves and later generations. 

“The custom in the kingdom of Tangut is for a young man, 
dagger in hand, to venture forth on certain days of the year, and 
to kill whomever he encounters, indiscriminately and with impunity ; 
they who die by his hand, it is maintained, are assured of greatest 
happiness in the life after this. 

“In Kachao there are murderers for hire, upon whom one calls 
in time of need: when you have someone to have killed, you engage 
one of these mercenaries and pay him his fee when the work is 
done. 

“This reminds me of the story of the Old Man of the 
Mountain. That prince, who held in his power the lives of all other 
sovereigns, had simply to send one of his subjects on a visit to 
this or that foreign potentate, and the emissary would strike his 
quarry down upon meeting him. 

“Professional assassins are available in Italy too, you may be 
sure: a wise government will always tolerate them. And no just 
government will claim an exclusive right to dispose of human life. 

“In Zeeland, in the old days they used to sacrifice ninety- 
nine men each year to the gods of the country. 

“When the Carthaginians saw the enemy at their gates 
they immolated two hundred children picked from the ranks of 
the higher nobility; one of their laws stipulated that only children 


786 %& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of that caste were to be offered to Saturn. A fine was levied upon 
the mothers who during this ceremony betrayed the least hint of 
sorrow; the immolatiors took place before their eyes. Well- 
advised people who brand sentimentality as a crime! 

““A Northern king, whose name escapes me at the moment, 
immolated nine of his children with the sole aim, he said, of 
extending his life at the expense of those from whom he took life 
away. Do not frown at this whimsical notion, but rather smile. For 
prejudices are pardonable when they produce pleasures. 

“Shu Um-chi, father of a late Chinese emperor, had thirty 
men stabbed to death upon his mistress’ grave, to appease her 
manes. 

“On his last voyage to Tahiti Cook discovered human 
sacrifices which had gore unnoticed by those who had preceded 
him on that island. 

“As Herod, King of the Jews, lay on his deathbed he had

then ordered his sister Salome to cause them to perish one and 
all at the moment he sighed out his ghost, so that he might be 
mourned universally ancl the Jews, weeping for their friends and 
kinsmen, be forced to sprinkle tears upon his ashes too. How strong 
must be that passion whose effects extend beyond the grave! 
Herod’s order, however, was not carried out. 

“With his own hand Mahomet II cut off the head of his 
mistress, to demonstrate to his soldiers that his was not a heart 
to be softened by love; even so, he had just spent the night with 
Irene and slaked his desires.** The same personage, suspecting 
that it was one of his masculine playthings who filched a cucumber 
out of his garden, had everyone in his seraglio paraded and bellies 
slit open till at last the fruit was found in the guilty one’s en- 
trails... . Finding some faults in a painting of the decollation of 
John the Baptist, he had a slave summoned and smote off his 
head, and showed Bellini, a Venetian and the author of the 
painting he was criticizing, that he had imperfectly grasped 
Nature. ‘See here,’ said Mahomet, ‘this is how a severed head 
ought to look.’ Once again, it was this great man who, philosophi-

‘“Abdalkar, general of the king of Visapur, had a harem

the eve of his departure. 

“The proscriptions of Marius and Sulla are masterpieces of 
cruelty; Sulla, butcher of half of Rome, dies a tranquil death at

such examples, that a God watches over us and must punish crimes! 

“Nero had ten or twelve thousand souls put to death in the 
circus because somebody, no telling just who, jeered at one of his 
drivers. It was during his reign that the amphitheater at Praeneste 
collapsed, causing the death of another twenty thousand people; 
who doubts that he was the cause of the accident, and that he 
arranged it as alewd prank? 

“Commodus dealt severely with Romans who read the life of 
Caligula, he threw them to the wild beasts. During his nighttime 
revels he amused himself multilating passers-by; or else would 
collect fifteen or twenty unlucky creatures picked up at random in 
the street, have them bound fast, and then, wielding a mace or 
club, exterminate them for fun. 

“The eighty thousand Roman captives Mithridates stew 
in his states, the Sicilian Vespers, the St. Bartholomew slaughters, 
the Dragonnades, the eighteen thousand Flemings the Duke of 
Alba beheaded to establish in the Low Countries a religion which

passions should always be generous in the taking of human life.

solace of tears. 

“Savages behave in the same way with captives. Their finger- 
nails are torn out, their breasts and fingers torn off; their flesh 
is stripped away in ribbons from their bodies; their genitals are 
pricked with awls, it is usually women who take charge of these 
tortures. They flog their victims, flay them; do, in a word, every- 
thing ferocity can invent to render the deaths of these wretches 
more frightful, and rejoice when they expire. 

“And the child itse.f, does it not offer us the example of this

“The Heruli, the Germans, sacrificed all captives taken in 
war; the Scythians were content to immolate one out of every ten

but if that man had committed a great many crimes himself, in 
killing him I do nothing worse than the law would do, and if I do 
evil, then so does the law: in which is it preferable to believe, the 
innocence of him who kills a criminal, or the infamy of the law that 
kills the criminal ? 

“In how many lands and over how many centuries have they 
not been immolating slaves upon the tombs of masters? Do these 
people, in your opinion, believe there to be anything of the crime 
in murder ? 

‘‘Who can guess at the number of Indians the Spaniards slew 
in their conquest of the New World? From nothing but trans- 
porting the invaders’ baggage, two hundred thousand perished in 
the space of a single year. 

“Octavian had three hundred persons butchered in Perugia, 
merely to fete the anniversary of Caesar’s death. 

“A Calicut pirate cruising down the coast runs upon a 
Portuguese brigantine; he boards her, finds the crew all asleep, 
and cuts the throats of them all, because they dared take a nap 
while he was ona foray. 

“Phalaris used to shut his victims up in a bull of bronze, so 
constructed as horribly to amplify the screams of the wretches 
imprisoned within. Strange invention of cruelty! and how much 
imagination it supposes in the tyrant who devised it! 

“The Franks had the right of life and death over their wives, 
and exercised it without respite. 

“The King of Ava detects rebellion in that handful of his 
subjects who have refused to pay their taxes; he has four thousand 
of them arrested and burns them all in the same great bonfire. 
There are never any revolutions in the states of a prince as 
enlightened as he. 

“Eulins of Romagna learns that the city of Padua has risen

against him; he claps chains on eleven thousand of these thought- 
less townsmen and in the public square puts them to death in the 
most various and cruelest manners. 

“One of the many wives of the king of Achem lets out a 
cry while dreaming, and it wakes all the others; hubbub in the 
harem; the monarch inquires into the cause for the disturbance; 
nobody is able to give him a satisfactory answer; whereat he puts 
all the three thousand women to torture, he has them subjected to 
unbelievable torments; nothing is found out; the two hands and 
two feet are then hacked off each one of them, and they are all 
cast into a lake.” The motive for this cruelty is not far to seek; it 
is undoubtedly of that kind which strikes bright sparks of lubricity 
into the soul of him who practices it.** 

“In a word, murder is a passion, like gaming, wine, boys and 
women; never is it got rid of, once it has anchored in habit. No 
activity irritates as does this one, none prepares so much delight; 
it is impossible to weary of it; obstacles sharpen its flavor, and 
the relish for it we have in our heart goes to the point of fanaticism. 
You, Juliette, have experienced how wonderfully it combines with 
debauches, and appreciated the tart flavor it gives them. It exerts 
a puissant influence at once upon the mind and the body; it in- 
flames all the senses, it enchants, it dazzles. Its impact upon the 
nervous system,.the commotion it produces there is greater by far 
than that of any other voluptuous agent; one is never fond of 
this one save inordinately, furiously, one never indulges in it save 
ecstatically. The plotting of it titillates, the execution electrifies, the 
remembrance inspires, the temptation to repeat it is enormous, 
the desire to do this and nothing else, constantly, is over- 
whelming. The nearer a creature comes to us, the more it 


32 Beaulieu reports the episode. 

33 Come now, Braschi, enough of these timid details, we want bold strokes and 
a broad canvas. Look here: the proscriptions of the Jews, of the Christians, of 
Mithridates, of Marius, of Sulla, of the Triumvirs; the slaughterings of Theodosius 
and Theodora, the furors of the Crusaders and the Inquisitors, the savageries of the 
Templars, the Sicilian massacres, those of Mérindol, of St. Bartholomew, of Ireland, 
of Piedmont, of the Cévennes, of the New World: the total shows twenty-three mil- 
lion, one hundred and eighty -housand human beings murdered in cold blood on ac- 
count of their opinions alone! The man who is fond of murder foments opinions in 
order that they give occasion fcr assassination.

wakes our interest, the more directly it touches us, the more 
intimately, the more sacred its ties with us, the greater our delecta- 
tion in immolating the victim. Refinements enter into the thing, 
as happens with all pleasures; from the moment this personal 
stamp is added, all limits are abolished, atrocity is wound.to its 
topmost pitch, for the sentiment that produces it exhales it in 
keeping with the increase or worsening of the torture; all one’s 
achievements now lie short of one’s intentions. The agonies leading 
to death must now be slow and abominable if they are to quicken 
the soul at all, and one wishes that the same life could revive a 
thousand times over, in order to have the pleasure of murdering it 
that often, and that thoroughly. 

“Each murder is a commentary and critique of the others, 
each demands improvement in the next; it is shortly discovered 
that killing is not enough, one must kill in hideous style; and 
though one may be unaware of the fact, lewdness almost always 
has the direction of these matters. 

“A rapid glance now at these simultaneously voluptuous and 
barbarous inventions. A sketch of them will not be displeasing to 
you,.I know: there is always something interesting and sublime 
about the violent aspects of Nature. 

“The Irish used to crush their victims beneath weights. The 
Norwegians would stave in their skulls. .. . The Gauls broke their 
backs. . .. The Celts drove a saber through their breastbones. . . . 
The Cimbrians disemboweled them or else roasted them in furnaces. 

“The Roman emperors used to enjoy watching young Christian 
virgins being whipped; having their bubs and buttocks tweaked 
with red-hot pincers; into their wounds boiling oil or pitch would 
be poured, and the same liquids squirted into all the orifices of 
their bodies. They themselves would sometimes play at torturer, 
and the martyrdoms then became a great deal crueler; rarely 
would Nero cede to someone else the pleasure of immolating these 
hapless creatures. 

“The Syrians flung their victims off mountain-tops. The 
Marseillais clubbed his to death, and was particularly wont to 
fasten on the poor, exhibiting a preference Nature always inspires. 

“The blacks of the Calabar River district deliver up small 


792 eb THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


children to birds of prey, which devour their flesh. The sight 
thereof is prodigiously cherished by savages. 

“Historians tell us that in Mexico, the patient’s four limbs 
would be held by four priests, the high priest would open him from 
throat to navel, tear out his still-throbbing heart, and smear the 
gore over the idol; at other times the patient would be drawn 
forward and back over a keen-edged stone till it sawed into his 
belly and his entrails spilled out. 

“In all this vast crowd of peoples covering our globe, hardly 
a one is found that has ever attached the slightest importance to 
human life, because the fact is that nothing less important exists. 

“Into the urethral canal the Americans insert a twig covered 
with little thorns, whic they twirl in one direction, then in the 
other, spinning it between their palms and keeping at it for a 
considerable length of time, to the appalling distress of the victim. 

“The Iroquois affix the ends of their victim’s nerves to 
sticks and, by rotating these, wind out the nerves like string; in 
the course of the operation, the body twitches, bends, and is dis- 
located in an odd manner, and must be very exciting to watch.” 

“You may be certain that it is,” Juliette remarked at this 
point, and went on to describe to the Holy Father the circumstances 
under which she had been able to witness this torture being per- 
formed; ‘‘the sight is overpowering; and you, my friend, could 
have gone for a swim in the downpour of fuck it cost me.” 

“In the Philippines,” the Pope pursued, ‘‘a guilty woman is 
tied naked toa stake and facing the sun; it kills her in time. 

“In Juida the belly is cut open, the entrails removed, the 
cavity stuffed with salt, the body hung out on a pole in the market 

lace. 
if “The Quoias hurl javelins at the back, the body is then cut 
into quarters, and the dead man’s wife is forced to eat it. 

“When the Tonkinese go each year to pick the arecas they 
poison one of the nuts which is then fed to a child, a happy harvest 
being ensured, they consider, by the immolation of this victim. 
Here again we find murder an act of religion. 

“The Hurons suspend a cadaver above the patient, in such 
wise that all the filth that spills from this dead body may splash

upon his face, and to this vexation such others are added as cause 
him to expire in due time. 

‘The fierce Cossacks of Ousk and those parts tie the patient 
to the tail of a horse, which is then ridden at a gallop over rough 
terrain; Queen Brunhilde, you will recall, died from a similar 
trial. 

“The ancient Russians impaled through the flanks and 
hooked by the ribs. Our Turkish contemporaries place the skewer 
through the fundament. 

“During his Siberian travels Gmelin saw a woman buried 
alive up to the chin; thus was she fed; and expired only on the 
thirteenth day. 

“The vestals were walled up in narrow little niches, where 
was placed a table and upon it a lamp, a loaf, and a bottle of oil. 
In Rome they have lately discovered an underground passage 
leading from the imperial palace to the field beneath which these 
vestal catacombs were built.** Which proves that the emperors 
either went to witness these enjoyable sights, or had the doomed 
vestals fetched to their palace, to enjoy them there and then kill 
them in a manner analogous to their particular tastes and their 
passions. 

‘In Morocco and Switzerland the guilty one is clamped 
between planks and sawed in two. Hippomenes, the African king, 
had his son and daughter devoured by horses that had been 
deprived of food for a long time; and did it without thought for any 
sacred ties of kinship; it is no doubt from this feat he got the name 
Hippomenes. 

“The Gauls first kept their victims five years in prison, then 
impaled and burned them, all this in honor of the Divinity, for it 
is upon that splendid machine all human iniquities must be blamed. 

“The ancient Germans smothered their victims in a mud- 
slough. The Egyptians inserted sharpened reeds into every part of 
the body, then set them afire. 

“The Persians, the world’s most ingenious race for the 
invention of tortures, lay their victim in a round boat and

inverted another over him, so that he was sealed between these two 
halves of a hollow sphere, except that his hands, feet, and head 
remained outside, passing through slots. He was forced to eat and 
drink in this situation; were he to refuse, his eyes were pricked 
with pointed instruments; honey was sometimes daubed on his face, 
so as to attract wasps; worms ate him alive. Who would believe it? 
Victims sometimes endured eighteen days of this treatment. What 
sublime science! And what art! For art consists in causing a little 
dying every day for as nany days as possible. The Persians used 
also to grind between millstones, or would flay alive and with 
green thorns rub the skianed body, which causes unheard-of suffer- 
ings. Nowadays in the harems, the fashionable torture for women 
with whom some fault has been found is to cut multiple incisions 
in all their fleshier parts, and then to pour molten lead into each 
of the wounds, one by one, drop by drop; to impale by way of the 
matrix, or to make a pincushion of the patient, using not pins, 
however, but sulphur-dipped splines which are lit and fueled by 
the victim’s own fat.” 

And Juliette assured His Holiness that she was familiar with 
this torture too. 

“Daniel,” the Pope went on, “informs us that the Baby- 
lonians cast unfortunates into hot ovens. 

“The Macedonians. crucified head downward. 

“The Athenians administered toxic brews, drowned in a 
bathtub after having slit the veins. 

“The Romans occasionally hung by the virile privities from 
a tree; the torture of the wheel was passed on to us by the Romans. 
With them an ordinary method of quartering was to bend down 
the crests of four saplings till they touched the ground, to attach 
the victim’s four limbs zach to one of these treetops, and then to 
let them all fly back upright at the same moment. Mettius 
Suffetius was drawn and quartered by four chariots. Under the 
emperors they flogged to death. Or placed the victim in a leathern 
bag along with serpents, and tossed the bag into the Tiber. At 
other times the victim was strapped to the rim of a great wheel, 
which would be spun very swiftly for a while, then suddenly made 
to turn in the opposite direction, which loosened the victim in- 
wardly and often caused him to vomit his very bowels. 


Juliette & 795 


“The great Torquemada had the tongs applied in his presence 
to the fleshier parts of the patient’s body; and at other times would 
have him sat upon a pointed stake in such a manner that all his 
weight must bear on his rump: a frightful position, whence there 
result singular convulsions and a death accompanied by spasmodic 
laughter very extraordinary to observe.*® 

“Apuleius speaks of the mortification one woman was made to 
undergo, its details are rather droll. An ass was killed, its entrails 
removed, and into its skin she was sewn, all save her head; she was 
thus exposed to wild beasts. 

“The tyrant Maxentius bound a living man to a dead man and 
left him to rot upon the corpse. 

“There are countries where the patient is tied close to a bon- 
fire; holes are bored in his body whereby the flames enter and con- 
sume him gradually from within. 

“At the time of the Dragonnades, girls who were loath to 
embrace the True Faith were seized and, in order to bring about a 
change in their minds, their anus and womb were funneled full of 
gunpowder. Next, they were exploded like bombs. You have simply 
no idea how this gave them a taste for the host and for auricular 
confession. And how can one help but love a God in whose name 
such wondrous fine deeds are wrought! 

“Coming back again to classical tortures we see St. Catherine 
bound to a nail-studded cylinder and rolled down a mountainside. 
Now there, Juliette, is a pleasant way of getting to heaven, don’t 
you agree? 

‘We see other martyrs of this same religion, whose apostle I 
am rather more from interest than from taste, having needles 
driven under their fingernails, roasted upon grills, lowered head 
downward into a pit containing a dog and a snake otherwise de- 
prived of food and drink, and having to endure a thousand other 
horrors of whose details you have a fair inkling.** 

“Moving next to foreign customs, in China we see the execu- 
tioner answerable with his life for the patient’s if this patient loses

step from affluence and softness to cruelty.

his before the appointed term, which is ordinarily very long, some- 
times eight, even nine days, and during this time the tortures are 
varied with utmost artistry. 

‘The English chopped into pieces and boiled them in a pot. In 
their colonies they slowlv crushed the Negroes in the sugar-cane 
mills, which is as slow a way to die as it is dreadful. 

“In Ceylon the-victirn is condemned to eat his own flesh or his 
children’s. 

“The inhabitants of Malabar are choppers also, they use a 
saber. Or else they feed to tigers. 

‘In Siam if you fall out of favor you may expect to be gored 
and trampled to death by bulls. The king of this country put a rebel 
to death by feeding him upon his own flesh, whereof he was given 
a slice from time to time; those same Siamese sometimes squeeze 
the victim’s body in a jacket through which he is pricked by very 
sharp instruments, to force him to hold his breath: next, the body 
is cut suddenly in two, the upper part placed straight on a red-hot 
brass griddle, which halts the escape of blood and prolongs the 
life of the patient whose existence has been reduced by a half. 

“It is not very differznt in Cochin-China, where they strip the 
man bare, bind him to a post, and remove one piece of his flesh 
every day. 

‘The Koreans inflate the victim’s body with vinegar and when 
he is swollen to goodly proportions, drum upon him with sticks till 
he dies. Their king put his sister in a brazen cage beneath which a 
fire was kept burning, anc she danced to amuse His Majesty. 

“In other parts the victim is fixed so that he lies in the air, 
one transverse bar supperting his thighs, his ankles attached to 
another; his shins are beaten with rods; occasionally he is struck 
on the buttocks; this latter method is widely practiced in Turkey 
and the Barbary States. 

“The object they call the pao-lo in China is a brass column 
standing twenty cubits high and having eight in diameter; it is 
hollow; from within it is brought to an extremely high tempera- 
ture ; when it is glowing, the patient embraces the column, is bound 
fast to it, and is slowly grilled. "T'was, they say, an emperor’s wife 


Juliette & 797 


who invented this torture, and never saw it being used without dis- 
charging deliciously.*” 

“The Japanese carve open the belly; the patient is sometimes 
pinioned by four men; from afar the fifth runs upon the sufferer | 
and as he somersaults over him, deals him a skull-shattering blow 
with an iron mace. 

“The Moravian Brothers used to tickle to death. A somewhat 
similar torture has been tried on women: experience shows they 
may be masturbated to death. 

“But what will surprise you even more is to see persons of 
condition and high rank plying the trade of executioner. What then 
is one to suppose, unless that they are guided by a cruel form of 
lubricity ? 

“Moulay Ismael was himself the chief executioner of the 
criminals in his empire; in Morocco no one was put to death save 
by his royal hand; and no one took off a head as nicely as could he. 
In performing these feats, so he used to say, he found inexpressible 
delight. Ten thousand unfortunates came to know the vigor of his 
arm: in those lands where he held sway it was a current opinion 
that he who perished by the monarch’s hand earned an eternity of 
bliss in Paradise. 

“The king of Melinde himself metes out the bastinadoes in 
his country. 

“Bishop Bonner of London himself depilated those who were 
unwilling to be converted, or lashed them. He held one man’s hand 
on a brazier until the nerves were burned. 

“Uriothesli, England’s Lord Chancellor, had a very pretty 
woman who did not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ brought 
before him, and he himself flogged her to ribbons and cast her into 
the fire. And do you fancy the lecher got through all this without 
an erection ? 

“In the year 1700, at the tume of the war of the Camisards, 
Abbé du Chayla ranged the Cévennes, whipping all the little girls 


37 Once women are in the habit of exciting themselves to pleasure only by giving 
vent to the cruelty latent within them, the extreme delicacy of their fibers, the pro- 
digious sensitivity of their organs cause them to go a great deal farther than men 
in this direction. 


798 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


who would not renounce their Protestantism; so severely did he 
deal with some that they died, and the shooting began forthwith. 

“It has been reported in several countries that when two 
criminals are being executed at the same time, the headsman steeps 
his hands in the blood of the first and wipes it on the face of the 
second before decapitating him. 

“Murder, we must conclude, has been revered and made a 
common practice all over the earth; from pole to pole human 
victims are sacrificed. Ezyptians, Arabs, Cretans, Cypriots, Rho- 
dians, Phocaeans, Greeks, Pelagians, Scythians, Romans, Phoe- 
nicians, Persians, Indians. Chinese, Massagetae, Getae, Sarmatians, 
Irish, Norwegians, Suevi, Scandinavians, all Northern peoples, 
Gauls, Celts, Cimbrians, Germans, Bretons, Spaniards, Moors, 
Blacks, all of them individually and generally have slain human 
beings upon the altars of their gods. From time immemorial man 
has taken pleasure in shedding the blood of his fellow man and to 
content himself he has sometimes disguised this passion under a 
cloak of justice, sometimes under one of religion. But, and of this 
let there be no doubt, his purpose, his aim has always been the 
astonishing pleasure killing procures him. 

“After such examples, Juliette, after such striking demonstra- 
tions, shall you be convinced that there is no commoner deed than 
murder in all the world, that there exists none more legitimate, and 
that it would be extravagance in you to have the slightest misgiv- 
ings or a single regret over all those you may have committed, or 
to form the cowardly resolution not to commit any more?” 

“Adorable philosopher!” I cried, flinging my arms around 
Braschi’s neck, ‘never has anyone dealt with this important matter 
in the way you have done; never has it been so precisely, so 
thoroughly, so plausibly explained; with so many curious anecdotes; 
with so many trenchant examples. Ah, all my doubts are dissipated 
now, I surrender to right reason; all my scruples are removed, the 
way ahead lies clear, and I am at the point of desiring, with 
Tiberius, that all mankind might have but a single head which one 
could have the pleasure of cutting off at a single stroke. 

“Let us go, Father, the hour is advanced; did you not say that 
morning must not find us still in our impurities ?” 

We moved into the basilica. 


Ee screens surrounded the isolated altar of St. Peter, 
making a space about one hundred yards square with the altar 
in its center; this room was completely shut off from the rest of 
the cathedral. Twenty girls and twenty young boys were disposed 
on tiered benches backed against each of the four sides of the 
arena; at each of the four angles of that superb altar, between the 
steps descending from it and the front row of benches, was a small 
Greekish altar intended for the victims. By the first a girl of fifteen 
was to be seen; by the second, a young woman of twenty, gravid; 
by the third, a youth of fourteen; by the fourth, a young man 
eighteen years of age and fair as Apollo. Three priests faced the 
great altar, ready to consummate the sacrifice, and six naked choir- 
boys were there to serve it, two of them stretched prone upon the 
altars, their sparkling behinds ready for use as holy stones. Braschi 
and I reclined upon an ottoman situated on a stage raised ten feet 
above the ground, access to which was had by a stairway whose 
steps were covered by a magnificent Turkish carpet; this stage was 
large enough to provide easy accommodation to twenty persons at 
least. Six little Ganymedes of seven or eight, all naked, sitting on 
the steps, were at a snap of the finger to execute the orders of the 
Holy Father; various costumes both gallant and picturesque 
adorned the men, but that worn by the women was too delicious 
not to merit particular description. They wore a shift of unbleached 
gauze fitting loosely, negligently to their figure, hiding none of it; 
and had a pink collarette around the neck. The tunic I have just 
spoken of was, by means of a broad bow of the same pink, gathered 
up in behind and left the flanks absolutely exposed; over this shift 
each had on a blue taffeta simar which, falling in ample folds back 
over the shoulders, shaded nothing in front; their hair floated in 
free tresses; upon her head each wore a simple crown of roses. I 
was so taken with the elegance of this dishabille that I decided at 
once to adopt something similar. ‘The ceremony began. 


801 


802 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


As soon as His Holiness formed a desire, the six aides-de- 
camp poised on the stairs immediately flew to satisfy it. Three girls 
were Called for. The Pove sat down on the face of one of them, 
bidding her tongue his «nus; the second mouthed his prick; the 
third dandled his balls; and while this was going forward my ass 
became the object of Pius VI’s lewd kisses. Mass was said and 
orders given that my wishes be carried out as promptly and fully 
as the Pontiff’s own. The Host once consecrated, the acolyte 
brought it up to the stage and respectfully deposited it upon the tip 
of the papal prick; the very next moment the bugger claps it into 
my bum, wafer first. Six girls and six pretty boys press around us, 
making flashing display of their asses and tools; I was myself being 
frigged from below by a very comely youth whose prick one of the 
girls was masturbating. There was no resisting this onslaught of 
lewdness; Braschi’s sighs, moans, pulsations, and blasphemies re- 
port his nearing ecstasy and precipitate mine; we discharge with 
screams of pleasure. Sodomized by the Pope, the body of Jesus 
Christ nested in one’s ass, oh, my friends! what rare delight. It 
seemed to me I had never in all my life tasted quite the like. We 
fell back exhausted amiclst that crowd of celestial playthings sur- 
rounding us, and the sacrifice was over. 

Forces must be regained; Braschi would have no tortures 
started until he was stiff again. As twenty girls and that many boys 
labored to restore him to life, while he looked avidly on I got 
myself thirty or so fuckings from a group of youths, exciting them 
four at a time while being caressed by a pair. Braschi, as I say, 
watched me perform these libertine excesses, he cheered me on and 
exhorted me to more. A new Mass was celebrated, and this time 
the Host, conveyed by the fairest prick in the room, was intro- 
duced into the fundamert of the Holy Father, who, beginning to 
stand aright, had asses fence us in and he re-embuggered me. 

“Good,” said he, withdrawing after a few lunges and re- 
coveries, “I merely warited to temper the blade. We may now 
immolate.” 

He gives the signal for the first execution; it was to be of the 
eighteen-year-old young man. We have him approach, and having 
kissed, caressed, sucked, polluted him, Braschi informs him he is 
going to be crucified like St. Peter, head downward. He hears his 


Juliette 803 


sentence with stoic resignation and undergoes it courageously. I 
was frigging Braschi while the nails were being driven in; and who 
do you suppose wielded the hammers? The same priests who had 
just celebrated the Masses. After afhxing the young man to his 
cross they attached the latter to one of the spiraled pillars of Saint 
Peter’s altar, and attention was turned to the girl of fifteen. She 
too was led up, the Pope embuggered her; I was frigging her; she 
was first condemned to the most vigorous fustigation, then hanged 
from a second pillar. 

Up stepped the boy of fourteen, Braschi embuggers him too; 
and desiring to carry out this execution personally, he subjected 
him to every known vexation and horror. It was at this point it 
occurred to me whata villain Braschi was. One has but to be on the 
throne to carry infamy to the last extreme: the impunity these 
diademed rascals enjoy leads them into refinements nobody else 
would even dream of. Sotted from lust, the monster finally tears 
the child’s heart out and devours it while loosing streams of evil 
fuck. The pregnant woman remained. 

‘Entertain yourself with this baggage,” Braschi said to me, 
“T leave her fate in your hands. I am not going to stiffen again, I 
can feel it, but it will nevertheless gladden me to see you have at 
her: no matter what the state I happen to be in, crime always 
amuses me. So don’t spare her.” 

The wretch approaches. 

“Whose is this child ?”’ I ask her. 

“One of His Holiness’ minion’s.” 

“And it was done within His Holiness’ sight ?” 

“Ves,” 

“The father, is he present ?” 

“He is standing there.” She pointed toward a young man. 

I now addressed him. “What you put into her you shall now 
take out—here is the knife, and act this very instant if you do not 
wish to feel its edge.” The crestfallen fellow did as he was told; 
each thrust of the dagger drew a discharge from me, and when the 
body was all one great wound and I all dry, we retired. 

Braschi was bent on having me pass the rest of the night with 
him, the libertine adored me. 

“You are firm,” he declared, ‘‘and that is how I like a woman 


804 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to be. Among them you do not have many rivals.” 

“Princess Borghese surpasses me,” I replied. 

‘Far from it,” the Pope retorted, ‘‘she is forever having fits 
of remorse. A week from today,” he continued, ‘I shall give you 
the supper I have promised; the Princess will be there, and your 
friends the Cardinals too. Believe that I am sincere, beloved child, 
when I say that I hope we shall achieve horrors exceeding anything 
we have accomplished this evening.” 

‘I too look forward to the occasion,” I said politely, having 
in mind the theft I was planning to operate on my next visit to the 
Vatican, ‘‘yes, I am in expectation of great things.” 

Braschi, who had been rubbing his testicles with a spirituous 
lotion meant to stimulate them, proposed that we return to our 
tricks. 

“I’m afraid I lack the consistency to embugger you,” said he, 
“but you might suck me.” 

I got astride his chest; my asshole settled over his lips and the 
rogue, Pope that he was, blew his seed into my mouth while for- 
swearing his God like an atheist. 

And he fell asleep. I was greatly tempted to take this oppor- 
tunity to steal everythinz I could carry out of his treasury; I knew 
the way, he had shown it to me himself, I would encounter no 
guards. But this project having been concerted with Olympia, I did 
not want to cheat her of the pleasure of participating in it; more- 
over, Elise and Raimonde were to be along and between the four 
of us we would be able o get away with that much more booty. 

Pius VI awoke after a short while. There was to be a con- 
sistory that day. I left him in peace to discuss the state of Christian 
conscience throughout the world, and besought pardon of mine for 
not having laden it with a sufficient quantity of crimes. I have said 
it before, I affirm it again: nothing is worse than virtuous remorse 
for a soul accustomed to evil; and when one exists in a state of 
complete corruption, ’tis infinitely wiser to overdo wickedness than 
to rest in arrears; for doing more always brings some pleasure, 
while from doing less one has nothing but pain. 

Two or three baths washed away the Pontifical stains, and I 
betook myself to the Borghese Palace to tell my friend of my 
Vatican success. 


Juliette & 805 


To avoid the monotony of details I shall not tarry long over 
those of the new orgies we celebrated there. The Sistine Chapel 
was their scene; above four hundred subjects of both sexes ap- 
peared at them; what was enacted in the way of impurities beggars 
description. Thirty virgin girls, between the ages of seven and 
fourteen and one more beautiful than the next, were violated and 
afterward massacred; forty boys met the same fate. Albani, Bernis, 
and the Pope buggered one another and were buggered, gorged 
themselves on drink and infamy, killed, bibbled and fucked them- 
selves senseless, and when finally they were, that was the moment 
we chose, Olympia, Elise, Raimonde, and I, to slip away and 
pillage the treasury. We made off with twenty thousand sequins 
which Sbrigani, posted nearby with a few trusty individuals, had 
transported straight to the Princess’ home where, the next day, we 
divided the loot. Braschi never noticed the theft, or else deemed 
best to feign not to have noticed it. I did not see His Holiness 
again; he felt, I suspect, that my visits to the Vatican were a little 
more than he could afford. In view of these circumstances I saw no 
reason to remain on in Rome, indeed, it seemed wiser to leave; 
Olympia was desolate when she heard the news; but part we must, 
despite the strain, and at the beginning of winter I set forth for 
Naples with a packet of letters of recommendation to the royal 
family, to Prince Francaville, to every other grandee and high-bred 
figure in Naples. My funds I left in the hands of Roman bankers. 


We traveled in an excellent coach, Sbrigani, my women and 
I. Four mounted valets were escorting us, when between Fondi and 
Minturno, where the road follows the Gulf of Gaeta and at some 
twelve or fifteen leagues from Naples, ten horsemen appeared 
toward dusk. Pistol in hand, they proposed that we quit the high- 
way and come have a talk with Captain Brisatesta who, honestly 
retired in a castle overlooking the bay, did not suffer gentlefolk 
traveling in the land to pass so near his dwelling without gratifying 
him with a visit. We had no trouble understanding the meaning of 
this language and after a rapid estimation of the odds between our 
forces and the opposing ones, we felt called upon to capitulate. 

“Comrade,” said Sbrigani to the officer, “I have always heard 


806 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it said that rascals get on together; if you exercise the profession 
in one way, we exercise it in another, and both of us are engaged in 
dupery.” 

“You will tell all that to my captain,” this lieutenant replied, 
‘tas for me, I simply obey orders and especially when my life de- 
pends upon it; march.” 

As the riders had been tying our valets to the tails of their 
horses during this excharge, we found ourselves without anything 
further to add. We advanced. The officer had climbed into our 
carriage and four of his men were driving it. For five hours we 
continued thus, and it was during that time our guide informed us 
that Captain Brisatesta was the most famous brigand in all Italy. 

“He has,” said the lieutenant, ‘twelve hundred men enrolled, 
and our detachments roam the Papal States as far north as Trento 
and southward to land’s end in Calabria. Brisatesta’s wealth is 
colossal. He made a journey to Paris last year and while there 
espoused the charming |ady who today does the honors of the 
house.” 

“Brother,” I said to the bandit, ‘‘it would seem to me that the 
honors of a thief’s house must not be very onerous.” 

“IT beg your pardon,” the officer returned, ‘‘Madame’s em- 
ployment is more considerable than one might think: ’tis she who 
cuts the captives’ throats, and I assure you she acquits herself in 
a thoroughly conscientious and commendable manner, you will be 
enchanted to die by her hand.” 

‘Ah, I see,” said ::, “that then is what you call doing the 
honors of the house—you are not reassuring, sir officer. And is the 
Captain presently at hore, or shall we have dealings with Madame 
alone?” 

“You will find thern both at home. Brisatesta has just now 
returned from an expedition to the interior of Calabria which cost 
us a few men but which was worth a great deal of money. Since 
then our pay has tripled: oh, he is a kind man, our Captain, as fair 
and just as they come. He always pays us according to his means; 
he’d give us ten ounces a day’ if his earnings permitted it. But here 
we are,” the officer said. “I am sorry that darkness prevents you 


1The Neapolitan ounce is worth about eleven French livres ten sous.

from seeing the location in which this superb house is set. Down 
below is the sea, we turn upward to reach the castle which cannot 
be approached otherwise than on foot; we must therefore alight. 
From now on the path mounts steeply.” 

Following the lead of our guides, after an hour and a half of 
struggling single file up the highest mountain I had ever climbed in 
my life, we came to a moat, a drawbridge was lowered, we tra- 
versed some fortifications bristling with soldiers, were challenged, 
allowed to pass, then found ourselves inside the citadel. It was 
indeed a formidable one, and maintained as it was by Brisatesta 
looked capable of withstanding any assault or siege. 

It was about midnight when we arrived; the Captain and his 
dame were in bed, they were wakened. Brisatesta came at once to 
examine the catch. His was a striking appearance. He stood five 
feet ten inches tall, was in the flower of his manhood, his face was 
exceedingly handsome and at the same time exceedingly harsh. He 
cast a quick piercing glance at the men in our party, his eyes lin- 
gered only a little longer upon each one of us women; his brusque 
manner, his fierce stare made us tremble. He spoke a few words to 
the officer; the men were immediately led off in one direction, our 
trunks and belongings borne off in another. My friends and I were 
cast into a lightless dungeon, where after groping about we found 
some straw; there we lay ourselves wearily down, rather to bewail 
our ill fortune than seek the repose our horrible situation denied 
us. What cruel thoughts assailed us then, how were our souls not 
tried! The anguishing recollection of our past pleasures rose to 
mind, and only made our present plight seem darker. From dwell- 
ing upon our state of affairs we could deduce nothing but melan- 
choly presumptions; thus tormented by the past, terrified by the 
present, shuddering at the future, the blood hardly ran at all 
through our feverish veins. "T'was then Raimonde thought to in- 
voke religion. 

“Don’t bother with those illusions, child,” said I, ‘‘when one 
has despised them one’s whole life long it is impossible, no matter 
what the circumstances may be, to believe in them again; let them 
lie. Only remorse, furthermore, recalls one to religion and I am far 
from repenting or even regretting anything I have ever done; of 
all those deeds there is not one I am not prepared to commit 


808 <2» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


afresh, granted the chance; it is over being deprived of my 
capacities I grieve, and not over the results obtained from them 
when they were in my possession. Ah, Raimonde, you do not 
realize the grip vice exerts upon a soul like mine! Riddled with 
crimes, fed by crime, it exists for nought but to batten on crime, 
and even with my neck on the block, still I shall be wanting to 
commit more; I’d like crime to emanate from my very ashes, I’d 
like the ghost of me wandering the world to harass mortals with 
crimes or to inspire crimes in them. I think, however, we need not 
be afraid, for we are in the hands of vice: a god will protect us. 
Much greater would be my dread were we prisoners of the fright- 
ful goddess men dare ca!] Justice. The spawn of despotism mated 
to imbecility, if ’twere ttat whore held us captive I would already 
have said my last farewells; but I have never been afraid of crime; 
the sectators of the idol we worship respect their peers and smite 
them not; we'll join forces with these people if need be. Though 
I’ve not yet met her, I like what I have heard about this Madame 
Brisatesta; I wager we shall please her; we'll make her discharge; 
and she'll not kill us. Come here, Raimonde, and you too, dear 
Elise, and since the only pleasure remaining to us is frigging, let 
us enjoy it.” 

Stirred by my speech and my fingers, the little minxes fell to 
playing; Nature served us just as well in this hour of grim ad- 
versity as in bygone days of prosperity. Never had I been so 
rocked, so whelmed by pleasure; but the return to reason was 
frightful. 

“We are going to be slaughtered like sheep,” I said to my 
companions, “‘we are going to die like dogs, it is useless to delude 
ourselves, death is the fate in store for us. And it is not death that 
I dread, I am philosopher enough to be very sure that I’ll be no 
more unhappy after vegetating a few years on earth than I was 
before I got here; no, it is pain I dread, these scoundrels are going 
to make me suffer; they will perhaps enjoy torturing me as I have 
enjoyed torturing others; this captain has an evil look to me, he 
has long moustaches, a bad sign, and . . . and his wife is probably 
as cruel as he. .. . Oh, a moment ago I was full of confidence, and 
now I quake.” 

‘“‘Madame,” Elise spoke up, “deep inside me there is a hope, I 


Juliette 809 


know not what it is, but your teachings put me at ease. It is accord- 
ing to the eternal laws of Nature, you have told me so, that crime 
will triumph and virtue be humbled; I place my trust in that 
immutable decree; ah, dear mistress, it shall spare us from 
disaster.” 

“To be sure, to be sure, and my reasoning thereupon shall 
appear lucid and incontrovertible,” said I to my companions. “If, as 
cannot be doubted, might makes right, and the mass of crimes 
weighs heavier in the balance than on the other side do virtue and 
its practitioners, human self-interest is but the result of man’s 
passions and nearly all of them lead to crime; well, crime’s interest 
is to humble virtue; therefore, in almost all the situations of life, I 
shall lay my stake by crime rather than by virtue.” 

“But, Madame,” said Raimonde, ‘‘look here, as matters stand 
between our captors and us, we are virtue, and vice is represented 
only by them; therefore they shall crush us.” 

“‘We are speaking in general terms,” I replied, ‘“‘this is but a 
particular case; Nature may make a single exception to her rules, 
and thereby confirm them, you know.” 

We were in the midst of such discussions when a jailer, of 
more forbidding aspect even than his master, unlocked the door 
and handed us a plate of beans. 

“Here,” said he in a guttural voice, “don’t waste any, it’s all 
you’re going to get.” 

“What,” I demanded, “‘is it then to be of hunger we are to 
die?” 

“No, for from what I hear you’re to be done in tomorrow, and 
Madame probably feels there’s no use spending good money to 
have you form turds you're not going to have time to shit.” 

“But, dear fellow, you do perhaps know what kind of death 
is being prepared for us?” 

“It'll depend on what Madame’s fancy happens to be, our 
Captain leaves all that up to her; she does whatever she likes; but, 
you being women, your death ought to be milder than the one the 
men in your party shall have to face, for Madame Brisatesta is 
not very sanguinary except with men. She enjoys them first; then, 
when she’s tired of them, she puts ’em out of their misery.” 

“And this does not arouse her husband’s jealousy ?” 


810 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Not at all, he does the same with women, when he’s finished 
amusing himself with them he turns ’em over to his wife who 
pronounces this or that sort of a sentence and usually executes it 
herself if the Captain is no longer in the mood for such pleasures.” 

‘Your master seldom kills?” 

‘‘Hardly at all. Five victims a week, maybe six. You see, he’s 
done so much slaughtering in his time! He’s tired of it. Besides, he 
knows his wife has a dreadful weakness for killing, and since he’s 
very devoted to her, he just steps aside and allows her to handle 
the business. Adieu,” said the churl, fitting the key into the lock, 
“I must be getting on my way, I have others to serve; we are kept 
pretty busy here; thanks to heaven, the house is always full, you’ve 
no idea the number of prisoners we take—” 

“Comrade,” said I. “our belongings—are they safe?” 

“Safe and sound in storage. You'll not be seeing them again, 
but don’t worry, nothing is ever lost around here, we are very 
careful about that.” 

And the door clanged shut behind him. Through a slot be- 
tween the bars a weak ray of light entered the dungeon, enough to 
enable us to see one another’s faces. 

After a moment I spoke to Elise. ‘Well, my dear, does that 
not suffice to dash whatever hope you have?” 

“Not entirely,” was the amiable girl’s answer to me, “I cling 
to it in spite of all. Let us eat and not despair.” 

That meager repast was barely finished when our warden 
reappeared. 

‘They are calling for you in the council chamber,” he in- 
formed us. “You won't be kept waiting, it’s for today.” 

We trudged after him. 

It was a long room we entéred at one end. At the other was a 
table, behind it a woman sat writing. Without looking up she 
signaled for us to approach; then, laying aside her quill, she 
raised her eyes and ordered us to reply to the questions she was 
about to ask . . . oh, my friends! what expressions can I find to 
convey my surprise. This woman about to interrogate me, this con- 
sort of the most wicked of all Italy’s brigands, it was Clairwil— 
my precious Clairwil, whom I found again under these incredible 


Juliette & 811 


circumstances. I could contain myself no longer; I rushed into her 
arms. 

“Whom do I behold?” cried Clairwil. ‘‘What! Juliette, is it 
you? Oh, tenderest friend, let me kiss you and may this, which 
would have been a day of sorrow for any other, become one of 
rejoicing for you!” 

The multitude of feelings that beset my soul, the conflict be- 
tween them, their vivacity and heat cast me into a veritable stupor. 
When I opened my eyes again I found myself in an excellent bed, 
surrounded by my women and Clairwil, who were vying for the 
pleasure of comforting me and giving me the care my state 
required. 

“Long lost and dearest heart, I have you back again,” said my 
friend of olden days. “What happiness this is for me! I have al- 
ready told my husband who it is destiny has brought under our 
roof; your servants, your effects, everything shall be restored to 
you, we ask only that you spend a few days with us; our style of 
life will cause you no alarm, I know you to have principles, and to 
be immune to scandal; what we achieved together in the past 
permits me to suppose that you will find this a sympathetic 
atmosphere.” 

“Oh, Clairwil, your friend is ever the same,” I exclaimed; 
“my mind has matured with age, and the progress I have made is 
of a sort that only renders me worthier of you; I joyfully await 
the criminal spectacles you prepare for me: we shall enjoy these 
pleasures together. For I have come a long way from the pusilla- 
nimity that came near to being my undoing once upon a time, and 
your friend, be sure of it, blushes no more save at: virtue. But you, 
dear angel, where have you been? What have you done? Ah, we 
have been separated for ages; what lucky star has led us both to 
this place ?” 

“You shall have all the particulars,” Clairwil assured me; “but 
I want you to begin by calming yourself, by recovering your seren- 
ity, by accepting our apologies for having given you such a poor 
welcome. You are going to see my husband, I venture to predict 
you will take very kindly to him. . . . Oh, Juliette, recognize the 
hand of Nature; she has always championed the cause of vice, she 
does so again, as you see. Had vou fallen into the clutches of a 


812 e% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


virtuous woman, you, vicious rascal that you are, you were doomed; 
but we are of your own sort, and by us you can only be saved. 
Cheerless followers of virtue, avow your weakness and may the 
everlasting superiority of crime over your souls of slime impose 
eternal silence upon you.” 

Brisatesta arrived just as his wife concluded this speech. 
Whether because the situation had altered or because my now 
tranquil spirits caused me to view things with a different eye, this 
brigand no longer struck me as so frightening; scrutinizing him 
attentively, I found him extremely attractive; and so in truth he 
was. 

‘You have got yourself a fine husband,” I congratulated my 
friend. 

“Look well at his face, Juliette,” Clairwil replied, ‘‘and tell 
me if you think none but the bonds of wedlock unite us.” 

‘You bear a strange likeness to each other, it is true.” 

‘This splendid fellow, oh, Juliette, is my brother; events had 
separated us, a journey re made last year brought him back to me. 
Marriage reinforced our ties; we wish them to be indissoluble.” 

‘‘And indissoluble they shall be,” said the Captain, “for when 
two people resemble each other so perfectly, when their inclinations, 
their morals so completely conform, ’tis madness ever to part.” 

‘You are a couple of rascals,”’ said I, ‘“‘you live in the depths 
of incest and crime, there shall never be any absolution for you; 
were you in my place, just come from Rome, all these sins would 
make you quake to the soul, and the fear of never being able to 
purge them would prevent you from persevering in your wicked- 
ness.” 

“Let us dine, Juliette,” said my friend, ‘‘you can finish your ser- 
mon over dessert.” Then, opening the door to an adjoining room, 
“There,” she went on, “‘are your possessions, your servants, there 
is your Sbrigani; be all of good cheer in this house, become its 
friends, and when you have gone away from here, make it known 
abroad that the charms of sweet amity have their faithful even in 
a den of crime and depravity.” 

A magnificent meal was awaiting us. Sbrigani and my women 
sat down beside us; my valets joined my friend’s in serving the 
dishes and pouring the wine; and we were soon all one happy 


Juliette & 813 


family. It was eight o’clock in the evening when we rose from the 
table. Brisatesta never left it before he was drunk; it appeared to 
me that his beloved wife had adopted the same failing. From the 
dining hall we passed into a larger salon where our hostess 
suggested we twine the myrtle of Venus to the vine leaves of 
Bacchus. 

“This bugger here has the look of a man with something in 
his breeches,” said she, pulling Sbrigani to a couch. “Brother, peep 
under Juliette’s skirts, you'll find she is favored in the way you 
appreciate.” 

“Oh, God,” I cried, my head beginning to reel also, “to be 
fucked by a highway robber, by an assassin!” 

And I was not done speaking when I was bent over a sofa by 
the outlaw, a prick as thick as my arm was already nudging between 
my quivering buttocks. 

“Fair angel,” the libertine said, “you will pardon a little pre- 
liminary rite without which, well standing as you see my prick to 
be, it would nonetheless be impossible for me to do your charms the 
profound homage they deserve; I shall be obliged to bloody this 
gorgeous ass, but trust my skill, you'll hardly feel a thing.” 

Catching up a steel-tipped martinet wherewith he dealt my 
behind a dozen whistling blows, he had laid open that entire part 
of me inside two minutes, without causing me anything like a 
disagreeable sensation. 

“That should do very nicely,” said the Captain, “my thighs 
shall be wet as they press against you, and my prick lodged deep 
in your bowels will perhaps wash them with a dense sperm, un- 
obtainable save through this ceremony.” 

“Lay on, brother, lay on!” called Clairwil from the midst 
of her fucking with Sbrigani, ‘ther ass has weathered the worst, 
we used often to wear whips out upon each other.” 

“Oh, sir!” I cried upon feeling the Captain’s outsized bludg- 
eon thunder into my rectum, “‘the lash was as nothing to this. .. .” 

But my protest came too late, Brisatesta’s monstrous engine 
had already struck rock-bottom; I was embuggered to the hilt. 
Others were imitating us: Clairwil, as was her custom, offering 
only her rear to her fucker, was solidly run on by Sbrigani’s 
spirited device, while Raimonde, frigging her clitoris, was bestowing 


” 


814 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the same voluptuous services to her that I was extracting from 
Elise. 

Oh, friends of mine, this bandit chief, what a fucker was he! 
Not so much attached to the one shrine where I at first thought 
his tastes would hold him fast, he alternately repaired to each of 
them and by that dual intromission the rascal kept me in constant 
discharge. 

“There it is, Juliette,” said he as he withdrew and couched 
his enormous member  etween my bubs, “‘the explanation and 
cause of all my wild ways and delinquencies; it is the pleasures I 
receive from this fine prick that have shaped my career; as is the 
case with my sister, crime heats me, and I am unable to loose a 
drop of fuck save through the plotting or enacting of some 
horrors.” 

‘Why then, for sweet fuck’s sake let us create a few of them,” 
I replied. “Since we are all animated by the same desire and the 
opportunity for satisfying it is probably within our grasp, let’s 
blend bloodshed and fuckshed. Have you no victims about?” 

“Ah, slut,” said Clzirwil, overtaken by a spasm, “I recognize 
you in those words, they are your hallmark. Come now, brother, 
let us please this charming creature, we'll immolate the Roman 
belle we arrested this mo-ning.”’ 

“Right you are, have her brought up; her death will amuse 
Juliette, we shall all frig and discharge while conducting the oper- 
ation.” 

The traveler arrives. Friends, will you guess the identity of 
the woman who now stands within my sight? Borghese, yes, she, 
the delicious Borghese; the sensitive Borghese; brokenhearted at 
my departure, life had lost all meaning for her, she had flown 
forth in search of me, and Brisatesta’s men had just taken her on 
the Naples road as they had taken me the day before. 

“Clairwil,” I excla:‘med, “this woman’s not for victimizing 
either, she is an accomplice, she is the friend who assumed the 
place you had occupied in my heart, to the extent that another 
could replace you there; treat her lovingly, my angel, the rascal 
is deserving of us.” 

And the heavenly Olympia kissed me, caressed Clairwil, and 
seemed to implore Brisatesta. 


Juliette & 815 


“Oh, Godsfuck,” muttered the latter, erected like a Car- 
melite, “this complication of adventures, heating in me desires to 
-fuck this lovely lady, cool me to other projects; first let’s fuck her, 
then we'll decide her fate.” 

I surrender my post to Olympia; her nobly formed ass re- 
ceives the wide praise it deserves. Using the same means he 
employed with me, Brisatesta makes the same artistic shambles of 
it and sodomizes it straight off and tempestuously. My women frig 
me, and Sbrigani goes on rasping Clairwil. For once no other 
stimulant is needed to rouse our spirits; Brisatesta lines us up in a 
row, all five on our hands and knees upon a sofa and our flanks 
nicely lifted: Sbrigani and he plumb us turn by turn, while one 
ass-fucks the other fucks cunt, and the scoundrels finally discharge, 
Sbrigani in Clairwil’s fundament, Brisatesta in Olympia’s. 

Some more decent behavior succeeded these pleasures. 
Borghese, newly emerged from a dungeon, also needed a bite to 
eat; she was served a supper and we went to bed. After breakfast 
the following morning, the reunion of a Parisian petite maitresse 
with a bandit chieftain in the wilds of Italy still seemed so sur- 
prising to us all that we begged the Captain to relate what 
promised to be a very unusual story. 

“I shall tell it if you like,” Brisatesta consented; “but it 
includes details rather more scandalous than those one would 
ordinarily hazard in company; your manners, however, vouch for 
your philosophy and I believe there is nothing I need keep from 
your hearing.” 


BRISATESTA’S STORY 


If modesty still had any habitation in my soul, I would surely 
hesitate to disclose my eccentricities; but having long ago arrived 
at that degree of moral corruption where one is safe from all 
shame, not the slightest scruple prevents me from confiding to 
you all down to the least and seamiest events of a life which, 
summed up in a phrase, amounts to a tissue of crime and execration. 
The gracious personage you see at my side, and who bears the title 


816 te THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of wife to me, is that and my sister also. We are both the children of 
that famous Borchamps, renowned not only for his concussions but 
for his wealth and libertinage as well. My father had just entered 
into his fortieth year when he married my mother, twenty years 
his junior and much richer than he; I was born before the marriage 
was a year old. My siste: Gabrielle came into the world six years 
later. 

I was turning sixteen, my sister ten, when Borchamps ap- 
parently decided that henceforth he alone would be in charge of 
my upbringing; we had been away at school, we were now fetched 
home. And to return under the paternal roof was to be restored 
as it were to life; the little we had learned of religion my father 
helped us now to forget, and the most agreeable talents he taught 
us instead replaced the gloomy obscurities of theology. We were 
soon to notice that my mother was in no wise pleased by such 
proceedings. Mild-tempered, gently bred, innately pious and 
virtuous, she was far from imagining that the principles our 
father was inculcating in us were someday to make for our hap- 
piness; and full of her little notions, she interfered as best she 
could in her husband’s enterprises, who while mocking her and 
sneering at her objections, went on notwithstanding to destroy not 
only all there was in us of religion’s principles but those of morality 
also. The most inviolable bases of what is popularly understood 
as natural law were likewise reduced to rubble; and this amiable 
father, in his eagerness that we become as thoroughly philosophical 
in our outlook as he, left no stone unturned in his effort to render us 
impassive before prejudices and insensible to remorse. To forestall 
the possibility of these maxims suffering contradiction, he took care 
to keep us well isolated fom the world outside. Only the occasional 
visit of one of his friznds, and of that friend’s family, ever 
mitigated our lonely retirement; the intelligence of the sequel 
requires that I now say something of this worthy individual who 
would pay us visits. 

Monsieur de Breval, forty-five years of age at the time, nearly 
as wealthy as my father, like him had a young and virtuous wife 
and, like him, a pair of charming children, one of whom, his son 
Auguste, was fifteen and the other, Laura, a truly stunning creature, 
almost twelve. Each time Breval came to our house he brought 


Juliette 2 817 


his wife and children along; we four youngsters would be put 
together under the supervision of a governess named Pamphylia, 
she being twenty, very pretty, and perfectly in my father’s good 
graces. All four being raised in the same manner, having identical 
information and attitudes, the conversations we had and the games 
we played were well in advance of our years; and truly, anyone eaves- 
dropping upon our conventicles would have sooner taken them for 
meetings of a philosophical circle than for the recreations of 
juveniles. By dint of being made familiar with Nature we were 
shortly lending an ear to her voice, and the extraordinary thing is 
that it did not inspire us to mingle. Each remained within the 
bonds of kinship; Auguste and Laura were in love, confessed 
their sentiments with the same candor, the same joy, as Gabrielle 
and I declared ours to each other. Incest does not cross Nature’s 
plans, since the first natural impulses we had were in that direction. 
There is this too which may seem remarkable: our young ardors 
were accompanied by no twinges of jealousy. This ridiculous feeling 
is no proof of love; begot of pride and selfishness, it is more a token 
of the fear of seeing another object preferred to oneself than to 
that of losing the object one adores. Although Gabrielle might be 
fonder of me than of Auguste, she embraced him no less warmly 
for that; and although I might worship Gabrielle, I did nonetheless 
conceive violent desires to be loved by Laura. Thus did six months 
go by without us combining any earthly element into this soulful 
metaphysics; ‘twas not willingness that we lacked, but instruction, 
and our fathers, who were keeping a watchful eye upon us, at last 
decided to lend their aid to Nature. 

One day when the weather was very warm and our elders, 
as was their wont, had forgathered to spend a few hours among 
themselves, my father, half-naked, came to find us and he proposed 
that we move from the nursery into the apartment where he and 
the other adults were; we accompanied him, the young governess 
following on our heels. And there, fancy our surprise at seeing 
Breval on top of my mother, and his wife the next instant under- 
neath my father. 

‘‘Pay close attention to this mechanism of Nature,” our young 
Pamphylia said to us, “study it well, your parents may soon be 
disposed to initiate you into these mysteries of lubricity both for 


818 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


your education’s and your happiness’ sake. Examine each of these 
groups; you observe that they who compose them are enjoying the 
pleasures of Nature; apply yourselves to imitating them. . . .” 

Upon all this we bent the stare of open-mouthed bewilder- 
ment, this being the usual effect such a spectacle has upon children’s 
minds; but a keener interest took hold of us by and by, and we 
went forward to view matters from nearer on. It was then we 
perceived the difference in the four actors’ situations: the two men 
were taking manifest pleasure in what they were about, while the 
two women seemed not “o have their heart in the game and even 
showed what looked like repugnance for it. Pamphylia demon- 
strated, explained, pointed things out, and identified them by name. 

“Retain it all carefully,” said she, ‘for you shall soon be put 
into action.” 

She then entered into the most extensive details. There came a 
momentary pause in the scene, but one which, instead of reducing its 
interest, enhanced its attractiveness. Leaping hotly away from 
Madame de Breval’s behind (for those gentlemen ass-fucked only), 
my father drew us toward him and had each of the four of us 
touch his member, showing us how it was to be frigged. We 
laughed, we gaily did as we were told, and Breval watched us 
while continuing his buggery of my mother. 

“‘Pamphylia,” my father said, “relieve them of their clothes; 
it is time to join a little practice to the theory of Nature.” 

The next instant, we are naked; Breval drops what he is in 
the middle of doing, and the two fathers fall to caressing us 
indiscriminately, fingering us and sucking us here and there and 
everywhere, without forgetting Pamphylia, whom the rascals 
fondle and kiss almost «o pieces. 

“What an atrocity!” cried Madame de Breval, “how does 
one dare behave in such a way with one’s own children?” 

“Silence, Madame,” her husband shouted at her; “confine 
yourselves, both of you, to the passive roles you have been allotted; 
you are here to be made use of, not to harangue us.” 

Thereupon returning quietly to work, the libertine and his 
colleague continued their examinations just as phlegmatically as 
if in this height of impurity there were nothing that could justify 
the two mothers’ feelings of outrage. 


Juliette & 819 


The sole object of my father’s fervent attentions, he appeared 
to be neglecting all the others in favor of me. Gabrielle, if you 
wish, did indeed interest him too; he kissed her, he frigged her; but 
his most impassioned caresses were all aimed at my youthful 
charms. I alone seemed to inflame him; I alone received that 
voluptuous caress of the tongue in the ass, sure sign of a man’s 
predilection for another man, certain gage of the most refined lust, 
and which true sodomites are loath to lavish upon women, from 
fear of the appalling disgust the environs expose them to; now 
ready for anything, my father steers me to the couch where my 
mother is lying, places me flat upon her belly, has me held there 
by Pamphylia who, naked pursuant to his orders, during the oper- 
ation gives him the world’s prettiest ass to handle. His lips moisten 
the spot he wishes to penetrate; once he considers the outer gates 
sufficiently ajar, his engine arrives before the portal of the 
temple... thrusts . . . pushes . . . passes in. . . drives far, and 
depucelates me with ecstatic effects. 

“Good my Lord,” shrieked my mother, ‘oh, what manner of 
horrors are these! Was your son made to be the victim of your 
libertinage, and are you not at all aware that what you have just 
done bears the stamp of two or three crimes, for the least of which 
there are gallows raised ?” 

“Eh, but, Madame,” was my father’s dry retort, “’tis pre- 
cisely what you tell me that is going to make me discharge the more 
deliciously. You have nothing whatever to fear, the boy is at a 
very fit age to endure these mediocre assaults, it could easily have 
been done four years ago, and ought to have been: I depucelate 
far younger children in the same manner every day. I have every 
intention of soon doing the same to Gabrielle, even though she is 
but ten: my prick is slender, thousands will tell you so, and as for 
my skill, it is incredible.” 

Be all that as it may, blood seeps from my wounds; floods 
of sperm stanch it, my father grows calmer, continuing, however, 
to caress my sister who takes my place after I have been dismissed. 

Meanwhile, Breval was not wasting his time; but being more 
enamored of his daughter than of his son, it is upon Laura he 
first opens fire and the little thing, likewise placed upon her mother's 
bosom, has just seen her maidenhead blasted.

“Fuck your son,” my father calls to him, “I am going to 
embugger my daughter: let them all four slake our brutal thirsts 
this day. The time has come to have them enter into the one role 
Nature assigned them to play; it is time they realize that it is 
only to serve as our whores they were born, and that were it not 
in the hope of fucking them, we might never have created them at 
all.” 

The two sacrifices are offered simultaneously. To the right 
one sees Breval depucelating his son while kissing his wife’s asshole 
and palpating his daughter’s buttocks, still slimed with his fuck; 
to the left, my father bum-fucking Gabrielle while he licks my 
behind, while he molests my mother’s with one hand and frigs 
Pamphylia’s anus with the other; both gentlemen discharge, and 
quiet is restored. 

The remainder of :he evening is devoted to giving us lessons. 
Weare married; my father mates me to my sister; Breval does the 
same with his children. ‘They excite us, prepare avenues, consolidate 
junctions; and while they have us thus linked front to front they 
sound our asses, now this ass, now that, taking turns; in such a 
manner that Breval would be buggering me while Borchamps was 
fucking Auguste, and waile all this was going on, the two mothers, 
constrained to participate in the celebration of the orgies, would, 
along with Pamphylia, be making broad display of their charms 
to the two libertines. A. number of other lubricious scenes follow 
that one: my father’s imagination was limitless. Messieurs place 
the children upon their mothers, and while the husband of one 
bum-fucks the wife of the other, they oblige us youngsters to frig 
our mothers. Pamphylia runs up and down the ranks, she cheers 
the contestants on, emboldens them, shows them the way; her turn 
comes, she is sodomized; delicious discharging finally pacifies 
spirits, and festivities are declared at an end. 

Several days later my father summoned me into his library. 

‘‘My friend,” said he, “you alone shall henceforth provide 
me the joys of my life; I worship you, and wish to fuck nobody 
else; I am going to send your sister back to her nunnery. She is 
very pretty, I do not gainsay it, I have received much pleasure 
from her; but she is fenale, and that in my view is a serious flaw. 
Moreover, I could well become disturbed by the pleasures you 


Juliette & 821 


might taste with her; I want only you beside me. You shall be 
lodged in your mother’s apartment; she will step down from her 
place and yield it to you, she has no other choice; we shall lie every 
night together, I shall spend myself dry in your splendid ass, you 
shall discharge in mine, we shall be very happy with each other, 
tis certain. Such assemblies as the one at which you were present 
will be held no longer; Breval is mad about his daughter, and plans 
to behave with her as I am going to do with you. We shall not 
cease to be friends; but, too envious of our mutual pleasures, too 
jealous of our own, we have reached the decision to mingle them 
no more.” 

“But my mother, Sir,” said I, “may not all this anger her?” 

“Dear friend,” my father replied, “‘listen carefully to what I 
have to say to you on that head; you are clever enough to under- 
stand me. 

“This woman who brought you into the world is perhaps the 
creature who in all the universe I most supremely detest; the ties 
binding her to me render her a thousand times more loathsome yet, 
that is my attitude. Breval has a similar one toward his own wife. 
The manner in which you have seen us use these women is the 
result of our disgust and our indignation; it is far less for the sake 
of amusement than in order to debase and degrade them that we 
prostitute them as we do; we outrage them from hatred and a kind 
of cruel delectation you yourself shall, I trust, someday come to 
know, and whereof the aim is to extract an unspeakable pleasure 
from vexations imposed upon an object one has enjoyed over much 
and over long.” 

“But, Sir,” was the question common sense bade me put, “you 
will then torment me also when at last you grow weary of me?” 

“That is an altogether different affair,” my father explained, 
“they are neither conventional usages nor laws which bind us, but 
rather similarities of taste, common convenience, that is to say, 
true love; furthermore, our union is criminal in the eyes of man- 
kind, and one never wearies of crime.” 

Knowing neither more nor better at the time, I believed all 
I was told and from there on lived with my father on exactly the 
same footing as if I had been his mistress; I passed all my nights 
at his side, very often in the same bed, and we would ass-fuck each 


822 + ‘THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


other until we collapsed from exhaustion into sleep. Pamphylia 
was, after Breval, our second confidante and a regular collaborator 
in our pleasures; my father liked having her whip him while he em- 
buggered me; he would also sodomize and lash her; and sometimes 
she would be made to kiss and caress me, then my father would 
invite me to do whatever I cared to with her, upon condition that, 
while I was doing it, I caress and kiss his ass. And Borchamps, like 
Socrates, taught his disciple even as he fucked him. The most im- 
pious, the most antimoral principles were suggested to me; and if 
I was not already out robbing on the highways, it was through no 
fault ef Borchamps. Now and then, at holidays, my sister came to 
the house, but she was not warmly welcomed there; very unlike my 
father in this regard, whenever I could obtain a moment alone with 
her I bore her testimony of great ardor, and fucked her at the 
slightest chance. 

“Father dislikes me,” Gabrielle told me, “he prefers you. . 
So it is, so let it be. Live happily with him and never forget me... . 

I kissed Gabrielle and swore I would adore her always. 

I had for quite some time noticed that my mother never 
emerged from Borchamps’ private study without a handkerchief 
pressed to her eyes and heaving sighs of greatest sadness. Curious 
to know the cause of her sorrow, I cut a slit in the partition separat- 
ing that study from my boudoir and, when the first opportunity for 
spying upon them came, stole quietly to the hole and peered 
through it. I was witness to horrors; my father’s loathing for his 
wife vented itself in the form of frightful physical mistreatments. 
There is no imagining what his ferocious lust would inflict upon 
that unhappy victim of his aversion; after beating her senseless 
with his fists, he would kick her as she lay on the floor, at other 
times he would flog her bloody with a martinet, and more often 
still he would prostitute her to an exceedingly ill-favored man, un- 
known to me, and with whom he held lewd commerce himself. 

‘Who is this fellow?” I one day asked Pamphylia, to whom 
I had confided my disceveries and who, full of friendliness for me, 
offered to help me make more of them. 

“He,” said she, ‘‘'s a professional scoundrel your father has 
saved two or three times from hanging; the sort of man who for 
six francs would assassinate anyone you wanted put out of the way. 


” 


Juliette 823 


One of Borchamps’ greater pleasures is to have him flog your 
mother and then, as you have yourself seen, to prostitute her to 
him. Borchamps is dreadfully fond of the man, and used to have 
him very often in his bed before that became your regular place. 
But you have still a few things to learn about the libertinage of 
him who sired you: be at your spyhole tomorrow and you will ob- 
serve a scene to outdo all those you have just now described to me.” 

No sooner am I at my post than four stout swashbuckling 
lads march into my father’s library, clap a pistol to his nose, seize 
him, bind him fast to one side of a double ladder, then, catching up 
each a bundle of withes, beat him about the buttocks and thighs, 
perhaps a thousand strokes apiece; the blood was bubbling out of 
him when they loosed his bonds to toss him upon a couch and as- 
sault him in such wise that at all times he had a prick in his mouth, 
one in either hand, and one in his bum. He was fucked more than 
twenty times over, and by what pricks, my God! I could not have 
got my hand around the smallest of them. 

“I'd have liked to have been embuggering you while watching 
all that,” I admitted to Pamphylia, “perhaps, dearest friend, you 
might be able to induce my father to have my mother the victim of 
a similar joust.” 

“Oh, that should not be difficult,” the dear girl assured me, 
“you have simply to propose a horror to Borchamps for him to 
seize the idea. You'll not have to wait long for the scene you 
desire.” 

A few days later, in effect, Pamphylia told me the moment 
was at hand, I glued my eye to the crack in the partition. My poor 
mother was lashed and sodomized with such force that the quartet 
left her motionless on the floor. As usual, Pamphylia lent me her 
superb hindquarters during the show; and I may honestly say that 
I had never discharged more deliciously before. 

I avowed everything to my father, including the extreme pleas- 
ure his clandestine revels had been procuring me. 

“The suggestion that you treat your wife as you have just 
done originated with me after I saw how you had yourself treated.” 

“My friend,” Borchamps wanted to know, “‘are you capable 
of helping me in these operations ?”’ 

“Be sure of it,” I replied. 


824 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Truly? This woman who brought you into the world?” 

‘She labored only in her own behalf, and I detest her as pow- 
erfully as you possibly can.” 

‘Kiss me, my beloved, you are delicious; and believe me when 
I say that you shall from now on begin to taste the most violent 
pleasures in the realm of human experience. Only in outraging what 
man is stupid enough to call the laws of Nature is he able to find 
authentic delight. Why, dare I believe my ears? You will mistreat 
your mother, word of honor ?” 

“More cruelly thar you, I swear it.” 

“You will martyrize her?” 

“‘Martyrize her, torture her, I’ll kill her if you like.” 

And Borchamps, who had been fondling my behind through- 
out this conversation, here lost control of himself, spilling his seed 
before he had time to skoot it into my ass. 

“Until tomorrow, my friend,” said he, “it’s tomorrow that I 
put your mettle to the test; between now and then, no nonsense, eh? 
Rest yourself, as I intend to do: fuck is vital to any such under- 
taking, one must lay by a double dose of it if one wishes to achieve 
infamies.” 

At the appointed hour my mother passed into Borchamps’ 
study; Borchamps’ wicked protégé was there; the scene was fright- 
ful. The poor woman burst into tears at seeing me there, and that 
I was one of her most implacable enemies. I strove to improve 
upon the horrors wherewith my father and his friend beset her. 
Borchamps would have the man embugger me as I lay atop my 
mother clawing the sacred breast whence I had first drawn suste- 
nance. Energetically prodded by a length of goed prick in my ass, 
my imagination wonderfully stimulated by the thought of being 
fucked by a professional rogue, I went a bit farther than I had 
been told and came away with the nipple of my very respectable 
mother’s right breast i1 my teeth; she emits a scream, loses con- 
sciousness, and my delirious father rushes to replace his friend in 
my ass, covering me with praise, and filling me with sperm. 

I had just attained my nineteenth year when my father at last 
chose to broach all that was on his mind. 

“I simply cannot stand the presence of that woman any 


Juliette & 825 


longer,” he declared; “I must get rid of her—but not outright, not 
crudely. Rather, by torturing her. . . . Will you assist me, my boy?” 

“The thing to do,” said I, ‘is cut her belly open, one horizon- 
tal slash, one vertical, I’ll go into her entrails with a hot iron, I'll 
cauterize her heart and viscera, she will die, but very gradually.” 

“Heavenly child,” my father sighed, “‘little angel... .” 

And this infamy, this execration by which I made my entry 
into the career of crime, it was enacted. My father and I consum- 
mated it in the throes of acutest pleasure; the rascal fucked my 
ass and frigged my prick while I massacred his wife. 

Unhappy dupe that I was! Lending myself to this crime I 
toiled toward nought but my own undoing; it was only in order 
to wed another woman that my father had got me to slay my 
mother, but so well had he hid his scheme that I went a whole year 
without guessing what he was about. Once I had wind of it I spoke 
to my sister. I told her the entire tale. 

“My child, this man is bent on destroying us,” said I. 

“That has been my opinion for a long time,” Gabrielle re- 
plied; ‘‘ah, dear brother, I would have spoken to you had I thought 
you would heed a warning, but you were blind to everything, and 
to his character blindest of all; we are both ruined if we do not 
take measures to prevent it. Are you as firm of soul and purpose 
as I, and shall we act in concert? I have here some powder, a 
schoolmate gave it to me; by these means she freed her own self 
from the parental yoke; let us do the same. If you cannot bring 
yourself to it, leave the thing to me; the urge has been on me for 
years, and I shall be acting in accordance with Nature’s reiterated 
counsels; and what she demands of us is just. Do I see you shudder, 
my friend?” 

‘Not from fear. Give me this powder : before noon tomorrow 
it shall be in the guts of him who presumes to make fools of us.” 

“Not so fast! Don’t think I am ceding you all the honor of 
breaking our shackles; we shall perform the deed together. I shall 
be at dinner tonight; take half the packet, put the stuff in his wine. 
To make sure of our kill, I’ll put the other half in his soup. We'll 
be orphaned in an hour; in three clays’ time we shall be sole owners 
of the possessions fortune has destined us to.” 

No mouse ever scampered straighter into a trap than did 


826 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Borchamps drink his way to the doom our wickedness prepared for 
him; he fell dead at dessert. This sudden end was attributed to a 
choleric stroke, and all was forgotten. 

Being nearly twenty-one years of age, I obtained patents of 
majority and the wardship of my sister. Once affairs were arranged 
she emerged as one of the most eligible matches in all France. I 
found her a man as rich as she, of whom she very dextrously disen- 
cumbered herself when once, by means of a child, she was assured 
of his legacy. But let us not anticipate events. Once I saw my sister 
properly established, I out my wealth into her safekeeping and 
told her of the exceedingly great desire I had to travel abroad. I 
converted a million into letters of credit with the foremost Euro- 
pean bankers; then I embraced my dear Gabrielle. 

“I adore you,” I to.d her, “but I must be on my way and this 
absence will doubtless last a little while. We are both of us made 
for great things and to go far; let us both gain more knowledge 
and acquaintances; later, we shall join company definitively, for 
heaven has intended us one for the other, and heaven’s wishes must 
not be disappointed. Love me, Gabrielle, forget me not, and I 
shall ever cleave to my love for you.” 

As for what became of Clairwil, the story, Juliette, is already 
known to you, at any rate for the greater part; she had, as I told 
you, contrived to slough off her conjugal ties, she was able to 
live a free and happy woman in the lap of abundance and lewd 
joys; her liaisons with the Minister cemented her disorders by 
guaranteeing their absolute impunity. There was a moment when, 
in desperate straits, you were led to form unreasonable suspicions 
and could doubt of her loyalty to you; but do greater justice to her 
heart, never was she your enemy, never did the Minister inform 
her of the fate he intended for you. I shall therefore say no more 
of her here, and shall be content to recount my own adventures; you 
will in due time hear of their denouement, of how we were brought 
back together and what the reasons are that enjoin us to live as we 
do, one for the other, in this impenetrable asylum of crime and 
infamy. 

The northern courts excited my curiosity, it was toward them 
I bent my steps; The Hague was the first I visited. The Stadtholder 
had just recently married Princess Sophia, niece of the King of 


Juliette hk 827 


Prussia. No sooner did I set eyes upon that ravishing creature than 
I desired her; and I had no sooner declared my heat than I fucked 
her. Sophia of Prussia was then eighteen years of age, and pos- 
sessed the loveliest figure and the most delicious face ever to be 
seen; but her libertinage was excessive and her debauchery so no- 
torious that by now her suitors were interested chiefly in her 
money. Promptly enlightened upon this object, I put myself gal- 
lantly forward; willing enough to pay for my pleasures, but young 
and vigorous enough to expect women to contribute to the cost of 
my travels, I was resolved never to accord my favors save to those 
who were capable of appreciating them. 

‘“‘Madame,” said I to the Princess after I had been tupping 
her steadily for almost a month, “I flatter myself in the belief that 
you will acknowledge the expense I have incurred on your account; 
few men, you will agree, can match me for endurance, none is better 
membered: all that comes with a price, Madame, in the age we live 
in.” 

“Oh, how you put me at ease, Sir,” the Princess replied, “I so 
much prefer to have you at my orders than to be at yours. Here,” 
she continued, handing me a purse bulging with gold, “and remem- 
ber that I now have the right to demand that you serve my pas- 
sions, however bizarre they be.” 

“It is only meet,” said I; “your gifts oblige me, I am at your 
entire disposition.” 

“Come this evening to my country house,” said Sophia, “come 
alone, and be not afraid, no matter what happens.” 

Though made somewhat apprehensive by these last words, I 
nevertheless decided to let nothing daunt me, so that 1 might come 
to a thorough acquaintance of this woman, and thereby be able to 
eke more money out of her. 

So it is I set forth alone and arrive at the indicated time and 
place; an aged woman opens the door and, without a word, ushers 
me into a mysterious room where I am greeted by a young lady of 
nineteen, exquisite to behold. 

“The Princess will soon appear, Sir,” says she, in a voice both 
sweet and pleasing. ‘‘Meanwhile, as she has instructed me to do, I 
shall ask you to make me the most solemn vow never to disclose 


828 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


anything of the strange rites which are to be celebrated here in our 
sight.” 

“Doubt of my discretion offends me, Madame,” I rejoined, 
“Tam dismayed, I am pained that the Princess can form it.” 

“But if you were tc have cause for complaint? If perchance 
your part in the proceedings were to be that of victim only?” 

“I should glory in it, Madame, and my silence thereupon 
would not be the less eternal.” 

“Such a reply might exempt me from insisting farther were 
I not obliged to comply s:rictly with my orders. I must have the re- 
quired oath, Sir.” 

I swore it. 

“And I add that if by misfortune you were not to keep your 
pledge, the speediest and most violent death would be your unfail- 
ing reward.” ; 

“Madame,” I protested, “this threat is superfluous; my man- 
ner of fulfilling your request would indicate that it was unmerited.” 

But Emma disappeared from the room even as I was speaking, 
and for a quarter of an hour I was left to my thoughts. 

When she returned she was accompanied by Sophia. Both were 
in a disorder that convinced me the hussies had just been frigging 
themselves. 

“Eh, by Christ’s tears,” said Sophia, “let’s not coddle the bug- 
ger any longer; we have bought him, he is ours to use, let us make 
the most of our purchase.” 

Emma invites me to remove my clothes. 

“You see very wel’ that we ourselves are naked,” she said 
upon observing me hesitate; ““do two women frighten you?” 

And aiding me to undress down even to my stockings, once 
I am divested of every stitch they guide me to a bench upon which 
they have me kneel on hands and knees. A catch is released; and 
suddenly all my limbs are shackled fast, and three sharp blades 
stand pointed, one at my belly, one at either flank, in such sort that 
I cannot stir a muscle. Outbursts of laughter answer the alarmed 
glances I cast around me, but what causes me truly to tremble is 
to see these two women pick up long iron martinets and approach 
me with visibly villainous intent. 

After twenty minutes the flagellation wore to an end. 


Juliette %& 829 


“Come, Emma,” Sophia then called to her fricatrice, “come, 
be a good girl and kiss me next to the victim; I like to juxtapose 
love and anguish. Let’s chafe cunts opposite the wretch, dear heart, 
and watch him suffer while we discharge.” 

The royal whore rings, two fifteen-year-old maids, beauties 
each, come to receive her orders; they strip off their clothes and 
upon pillows strown in front of me the tribades spend an hour wal- 
lowing in swinish delights; now and again one of them would 
wriggle toward me, she would provoke me with a display of her 
charms presented from every angle and as soon as she saw the 
impression she was able, despite my inconveniencing position, to 
cause upon me, she would slither away again, laughing at my help- 
lessness. Sophia, as you may easily imagine, played the leading role 
in this obscene drama, everything centered upon her, all efforts were 
deployed in her favor, and I assure you I was perfectly amazed to 
find such science, such subtlety, and such impurity in someone so 
young. It was very clearly to be seen that the rascal’s passion, as 
with nearly every other woman who has a taste for her sex, was 
to have her clitoris sucked while sucking that same part in others. 
But Sophia did not stop there: she was encunted, embuggered with 
dildoes; and there was not a tit she took but she gave a tat. And 
when from sucking and fucking the slut was very high and very 
hot, ‘‘Come,”’ she said, ‘‘let’s settle this knave’s affair.” 

The whips are fetched out again, the two newcomers are 
armed with a pair of them. Sophia opens the assault by dealing mé 
fifty rapid and powerful strokes. In the midst of her cruelty she 
preserved an unbelievable calm. After every ten stripes she would 
come around and gaze gleefully at my face, studying the effects nec- 
essarily wrought there by the ferocious pain she inflicted; once she 
was done she established herself in front of me, flung wide her 
thighs, bade her three consorts whip me as hard as she had just 
done, and during the ordeal she had her'self frigged. 

“One moment,” said she when the tally had risen nearly to 
two hundred lashes, “I am going to slip beneath him in order to 
suck him while the whipping continues; arrange yourselves in such 
a way that my clitoris gets a sucking in return from one of you and 
I have someone else’s clitoris to finger.” 

The actresses take their place, the play begins . . . and, vio- 


830 «% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lently excited by the blows I was receiving, deliciously sucked by 
Sophia, I shall not pretend that before three minutes of this had 
gone by I had not filled her mouth with fuck; she swallowed it and 
promptly slithered out from under my belly. 

“Emma,” she exclaimed, “‘he is charming, he discharged, I 
must now repay him with a fucking.” 

A dildo is fitted around her loins, and here’s the whore in my 
ass, cunt-sucking two of her sweethearts while the third gives her 
cuntwardly what I am getting bumwise from her. 

“You may release him now,” she said when at last she could 
stand no more. “Come kiss me, Borchamps,” the Messalina went 
on; ‘‘come express your gratitude, I have given you no end of 
pleasure. Nor is that all: I rarely treat a man with such forbear- 
ance. Poor child, all this that has just happened must be laid up 
alone to your puerile modesty. Just think of it! You have bedded I 
don’t know how many tirnes with me, and always content to encunt 
me like any imbecile, not once has it ever seemed to enter your 
silly little head that I have an ass. Why, such a story would simply 
not be believed.” , 

“The desire made itself felt in me, Madame; but timidity held 
it in check.” 

“A pity . ..a pity; modesty is no longer excusable at your 
age. But shall we let bygones be bygones? Will you make amends 
for your callowness, and forget my cunt a little in order to concern 
yourself a little with my ass? (She herewith turned around and 
showed it to me.) A pretty ass, is it not ? See how smooth it is, how 
fair, and how it yearns for you—so fuck it, Borchamps. Take his 
prick, Emma, there’s a clear, and clap it into my ass.” 

My response was to bestow a thousand kisses upon that truly 
superb behind; and my engine, trained by Emma upon the cunning 
little hole, shortly convinced Sophia of my burning eagerness to 
right past wrongs. 

“Stay,” the Princess bade me, “‘’tis I who now wish to be slave 
to you, I shall place myself in the machine where a moment ago 
you were captive, now I shall be yours; exercise your rights, sultan, 
and take a keen revenge.” (The irons hold her wrists and ankles 
fast.) ‘Spare me not, I beseech you; punish at once the whorish- 
ness and the cruelty in me.”

“Buggeress!” I cried, divining her tastes, ‘‘it’s a lashing you 
want, and they shall be awful strokes you'll get.” 

“I do dearly hope so,” said she. ‘Touch the skin on my ass, 
see how it glistens, fairly cries out for the whip.” 

“Aye, it is so,” said I, therewith dealing the first blow. And 
while I smote her with might and main the lovely Emma, kneeling 
before me, sucked my engine and the two girls of fifteen busied 
themselves about my ass. When Sophia’s was all in tatters, my 
furious device, bolting headlong into her anus, consoled her for 
my barbarity. 

“Ah, fuck!” she shrieked, “how delicious to be embuggered 
directly after a whipping; nothing marries so happily as these two 
pleasures.” 

Emma then advances upon her mistress, frigs her, kisses her, 
teats her, frigs herself, and we all three sink in a sea of delights. 

“Borchamps,” the Princess said to me as we were readjusting 
ourselves, ‘‘there is, it seems to me, a certain community of spirit 
between us, and I feel less reluctant to confide myself to you.” 

Upon a signal the young girls retired and we three having 
seated ourselves around a table, here as follows is the speech Sophia 
made to us the while we drank punch and genever. 

“To ordinary souls, to small minds it will perhaps appear odd 
that as my device for sounding your character I choose lubricity. 
Surprise at that is ridiculous; if by misfortune this be your case, 
let me then tell you, my dear, that I never judge of what a man is 
in the course of life, save by his passions in libertinage. He whose 
fiery spirit displays energetic tastes is indubitably susceptible of 
resolute action where interest or ambition is the concern: you are 
hot-blooded and no dullard. Say, Borchamps, what are your politics 
regarding human life ?”’ 

“Princess,” I answered, “of what price was it in the eyes of 
the Duke of Alba when he undertook to subdue these provinces ?” 

“Delicious man,” said my ardent interlocutress, “such is the 
reply I wanted from you; I count upon your courage,” she added, 
squeezing my hand, “‘now listen to what remains for me to propose 
to you. 

“Niece of Europe’s hero, sprung from the line of a man made 
to reign over the entire world, I bring to these Low Countries his 


832 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


soul, his vision, and his vigor; I presume that you recognize, Bor- 
champs, that I am fitted for better than to be wife to a republican 
doge, and this soft, mercantile, and craven people, born to wear 
irons, ought to be honored by mine. I am nothing loath to reign 
over the Dutch, but the throne raised upon these humid plains must 
be wet also with their tears and built by their gold. One hundred 
armed battalions assure my project; Frederick is sending them from 
Konigsberg. This revolution does not doom my husband’s head; he 
is worthy of me, and Batavia’s blood, shed in great floods, will 
cement the throne to which | pretend. It is therefore not the scepter 
I offer you; I simply propose to you the place of him who is to de- 
fend my keeping of it: you shall be our counselor, our minister, 
our strong right arm; the proscriptions will be dictated, executed 
by you: the post requires boldness; have you that quality in suitable 
measure ? Answer as you are of a mind.” 

‘““Madame,” said I after taking thought for a moment, “be- 
fore fixing upon this startling act of power and authority, did it 
occur to you to inquire how this revolution might be viewed by the 
neighboring powers? The French, the English, the Spanish, the 
northern States also, who see in you mere courtiers and tradesmen, 
shall they sit calmly by and watch you become rivals and van- 
quishers ?” 

“We are sure of France’s attitude; we don’t care a fig for the 
rest. Once sovereign in the United Provinces we shall take the field 
against the three major kingdoms and perhaps bring them very 
quickly to their knees. Everyone trembles before a warlike nation; 
such shall ours become. One great man is enough to subject the 
world: there is that greatness in my soul, I have it from mighty 
Frederick. We here are weary of belonging to whoever bothers to 
invade us and of being the easy prize with which every European 
conqueror’s career begins.” 

“Once given arms to repulse the cruelties of Spain, will the 
Dutch surrender them and suffer your tyranny ?” 

“Courts shall be set up, as they were by Alba. There is no 
other way to bring a people to heel.” 

“Your subjects will flee the land.” 

“Tl have the property they leave behind. From the flight of 
rebels I stand only to gain; it will simplify the matter of maintain- 


Juliette & 833 


ing my grip upon those who stay. My aim is not to become the 
quaking monarch of many, but to rule despotically, if need be over 
a few.” 

‘Sophia, I believe you cruel, and it is nought, I fear, but lust? 
that fires you in this ambition.” 

“Nearly all the vices in the heart of man have the same cause: 
all proceed from his more or less marked propensity to lubricity. 
This propensity, ferocious in a strong spirit, leads the solitary 
mortal, lost and alone in Nature’s wilderness, to perpetrate a thou- 
sand furtive horrors, and him who governs others, to perpetrate a 
thousand political crimes.” 

‘Oh, Sophia, I understand what it is you seek; ambition in 
you is nothing else than the desire to lose your fuck with somewhat 
greater warmth.” 

‘Little does it matter what sentiment engenders ambition once 
it exists and is confirmed by a crown. But, my friend, if you reason 
thereupon, you waver; waver, and you tremble; and for him who 
trembles I have no use at all.” 

Singularly aroused by Sophia’s propositions, taking a view 
analogous to hers in seeing herein sure means for exercising my 
native ferocity, I promised everything. Sophia embraced me, had 
me repeat the most solemn oaths to absolute secrecy, and we took 
leave of each other. 

I went thoughtfully homeward; by the time I reached my lodg- 
ings I was beginning to sense the full danger of the engagements I 
had just contracted, and noticing that the risks involved in breaking 
them hardly outweighed those in keeping them, I spent the night 
in dreadful perplexity. There’s nothing for it, I said to myself, I 
am done for either way, the only solution lies in flight. Oh, Sophia, 
had you but proposed some private crimes, I’d gladly have com- 
mitted them all, for with you as my accomplice I could have laughed 
at the Jaw. But to expose myself to every imaginable risk only to 
be the agent of your despotism! No, woman, count not upon me. 
Ready I am and very willing to commit crimes for my passions’ 
sake, not one will I do to benefit the passions of others. When my

many revolutions explained by this single word! 


834 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


refusal comes to your knowledge, tax Borchamps not so much with 
faintheartedness as with greatness of soul... . 

I stole out of the city that very night and made in all haste for 
the port nearest England. En route I was momentarily assailed by 
regrets: what with my profound liking for crime, it was hard for 
me to think I had declined Sophia’s offer of the political means for 
committing a lot of it. But I reminded myself that her projects had 
been rather too uncertain; and, in addition, that I would be happier 
operating for my own advantage than for that of some crowned 
individual. 

Upon reaching London I took apartments in Piccadilly, where 
I had the misfortune, the very next day, of being robbed of every 
penny I had about me; this was a serious loss, since the previous 
week, in The Hague, I had cashed all my letters of credit. There 
was nothing else for me “o do than set straight out with the letters 
of recommendation I had to various London notables, and to beg 
some aid at least for the short time it would take me to obtain funds 
from my sister. 

From what I had heard tell of Lord Burlington I decided that 
this was the man to see first. When he had finished reading my let- 
ters, I recounted my woes; the good Englishman was prepared to 
do me every sort of service. Although Burlington was not very rich, 
one thousand guineas were his immediate offer, and he simply would 
not hear of my lodging anywhere except under his own roof. I ac- 
cepted his invitation all the more readily for having already taken 
stock of this honest family and detected there a quantity of possi- 
bilities for repaying, in the form of crimes, the debt of gratitude 
I owed my benefactor. 

Before entering into the details of the little infamies with 
which I was about to occupy myself, it is essential that I give you 
an idea of the persons in whose midst I had landed. 

Burlington, the ktndliest and most ingenuous of men, must 
have been nearing fifty-five; blithe, guileless, void of penetration, 
at once generous and a fool, such was my Lord’s portrait. A son-in- 
law and two daughters composed the rest of the household. Tilson, 
but twenty-three, had just wedded the elder of the girls, who was 
about the same age as he. They were a delicious couple the like of 
which Nature affords us only rare examples; charms, graces, naiveté, 


Juliette & 835 


candor, piety, gentility, good breeding, nothing was lacking, and 
this personification of all the virtues assembled consoled Burlington 
for the wild conduct of Miss Cleontine, the younger of his daugh- 
ters, at most eighteen years of age, and the loveliest creature you 
have ever clapped eyes on. But mischievousness, nay, downright 
wickedness, black whorishness carried to extreme lengths, those 
were Cleontine’s incorrigible vices; wherein she had the audacity 
to assert she was a thousand times happier than ever was Clotilda 
in her dull and tedious virtues. 

Upon perceiving the girl’s delicious character I became 
straightway enamored of her, to the extent a man so corrupt as I 
could be enamored of anyone; but her father having confided to 
me all the heartaches this young person caused him, I found myself 
obliged to proceed with utmost circumspection. 

Over and beyond the tumultuous impressions Cleontine was 
producing in my soul, Tilson’s pretty face and the graces of his 
charming wife remained ever clear in my eye, and if Cleontine in- 
spired the more libertine desires in me, her brother-in-law and 
sister quickened the more sensual. I imagined Tilson’s ass as a 
masterpiece, and the desire to fuck him burned just as keenly in 
me as the idea of doing the same to his voluptuous partner. Set 
upon by all these various passions, it seemed to me that the proper 
way to satisfy them was to begin with Cleontine. Everything which 
can conspire to a woman’s downfall being already contained in the 
soul of her whom I was attacking as well as in my means for seduc- 
tion, the dear child was quickly mine. 

Nothing so fresh, nothing so plump, nothing so pretty as all 
the parts of that charming thing’s body, nothing so eloquent as the 
voice of her passions, nothing so lewd as her mind. There was a 
moment when, truly, I wondered whether I was not better behaved 
than she; whereupon, as you may readily imagine, there was no re- 
striction to the pleasures we tasted; and Cleontine avowed to me 
that the more a delight seemed in conflict with the laws of Nature, 
the more it stimulated her lubricity. 

“Alas!” she said one day, “I have come to the point where I 
find none strong enough to satisfy me.” 

Her pretty ass was attacked on the spot, and the pleasures she 
gave me in that style were so piquant, so poignant, so thoroughly 


836 <k THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


shared by her, that we came to the mutual agreement not to bother 
with any other sort. 

So taken up was I over that beautiful girl’s charms that a year 
elapsed and I had still not dared communicate my projects to her, 
or at least had not thought to, so busily was I occupied with our 
affair. Burlington and I were quits, and for the better carrying out 
of my plans I had left his house and taken quarters nearby. He, his 
family, his children would pay me daily visits, and our intimacy be- 
came so great that my raarriage to Cleontine was soon being ru- 
mored about town. Oh, but I was far from such a piece of folly! 
I was willing enough to amuse myself with that interesting creature, 
but marry her! ah no, never; only Lady Tilson excited that desire 
in me. ; 

A wife, said I to myself, a wife can answer no purpose save 
that of serving us as a victim, and the more her beauty is of the 
romantic type, the better she is equipped for this role. And here is 
Clotilda. To see her in my clutches, ah, how it stiffens my prick; 
how marvelous she must be in tears! How delightful it must be to 
cause them to flow from such heavenly eyes. Oh, Clotilda, what an 
unhappy woman you shall be if ever you become mine. 

These designs once formulated, it was henceforth only to help 
achieve them that I continued to cultivate Cleontine. To that end 
I could think of nothing better than to kindle in her a fancy for 
her brother-in-law and chen to arouse his young wife’s jealousy. 
Cleontine admitted that she had now and then felt an urge for 
Tilson, but that the thought of his stupidity and virtuousness had 
always dashed cold water on her desires. 

“But what does intelligence matter!” I replied. “Once beauty 
décorates an individual, there’s enough to warrant having him. 
Even as you see me now, Cleontine, I am dreaming of the world’s 
most wonderful ass, Tilson is its proprietor, and I am sweating 
from eagerness to fuck it.” 

This idea diverted my mistress, and she was won over—put a 
few nasty thoughts in a woman’s head and there is nothing you can 
not get out of her. A pang of jealousy, however, made her pause; 
she wondered if, taken by the husband, I might not perhaps be- 
come too fond of his wife; she questioned me. 


Juliette & 837 


“Come, come,” said I, feeling that prudence was needed here, 
“you are being extravagant. My eye alights on a pretty boy, the 
sentiment is purely material; but where it comes to women, my love 
for you, Cleontine, is not something from which I can swerve.” 

My insipid compliments, the irregularity of my caprices, every- 
thing seduced Cleontine, she served me; that was all I wanted of 
her. Before a month had passed my beloved Tilson was in my 
mistress’ arms; I watched him as he lay there, caressed him as he 
lay there, fucked him as he lay there; such scenes of libertinage oc- 
cupied another month and then, the illusion gone and I having had 
my fill of them both, I began to dwell on schemes for undoing them, 
for including my benefactor in the holocaust, and for spiriting 
Clotilda away, taking her to the farthermost ends of the world to 
glut myself on the divine pleasures I awaited from her. 

As the young woman positively worshiped her husband it was 
easy for me to strike sparks of jealousy into her soul: Lady Tilson 
listened to me, believed me, and when all I had left to do was con- 
vince her, the means stood ready to hand. 

“Cleontine,” I said one day to my voluptuous whore, “‘shall 
I confess it to you, my love? I am fairly dying to marry you. The 
similarity between our two characters, our two temperaments, leads 
me to feel that we would be very happy together. But you are penni- 
less, I am rich .. . and unless I am wholly mistaken, delicacy would 
forbid you from entering into a marriage unprovided with the 
blessings of fortune. There is a way, Cleontine, whereby you could 
swing this capricious fortune into your favor and hasten its gifts. 
Between you and wealth I see no more than three lives standing in 
the way.” 

And noticing Cleontine wax drunk on the poison I was dis- 
tilling into her soul, I bravely doubled the dose. 

“Nothing simpler,” I went on, “than to get rid of Tilson. His 
wife is willful, headstrong, extremely jealous; she will not learn of 
her husband’s guilty dealings with you without furiously desiring 
to be revenged upon him; I will counsel her, I will furnish her what 
she needs; I see Tilson in his forefathers’ tomb before a week is 
out.” 

“My sister is virtuous.” 


838 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“She is vindictive; her upright soul would not all by itself 
hatch the plot I shall suggest to her, but when warmly proposed by 
me she will seize what I offer her, be sure of it.” 

“And the others?” Cleontine abruptly demanded. 

“Ah, little minx,” said I, folding her in my arms, “every pass- 
ing minute brings added proof that Nature created us for each 
other. And so here is how we shall be rid of those others, my angel: 
once Lady Tilson has acted upon my advice and removed her hus- 
band from the picture, I shall unveil the whole intrigue to her father 
who, likewise pressed bv my solicitations, shall, I am confident of 
it, call in the police. Sae will be brought to trial. Her lawyer, 
selected and perfectly feed by me, will embrace Clotilda’s cause 
and so plead it as to shift the guilt onto the father who will be 
shown to have murdered his son-in-law and had his daughter ar- 
raigned on false charges. The witnesses, the testimony, the proofs: 
with guineas all that is to be found in London, just as with Jowis 
it is in Paris. A fortnight and Burlington is lying in one of His 
Majesty’s jails.” 

“Your benefactor ?”’ 

“Ah, Cleontine, what must I call the man whose existence casts 
a cloud upon our future together? This arch-enemy is no sogner 
flung into prison, condemned (he will be, Cleontine, inside a month 
from today), than he mounts the scaffold; he is no sooner dead, 
I say, than your sister is freed and we leave. We leave England, 
I wed you, and simply consider how easy it will be to eliminate the 
last obstacle preventing you from taking exclusive possession of 
Burlington’s estate.” 

“Oh, my friend, you are a villain!” 

‘“T am but a man and one who adores you, Cleontine, who 
cares for nought but to see you rich and his married wife.” 

“But my father... and all he has done for you—” 

“Beside the sentiments I owe you all others pale, they vanish: 
I must possess you, Cleontine, there is nothing I do not sacrifice 
in order to succeed.” 

The ardent creature effuses her gratitude, showers kisses upon 
me; she swears to aid me, and streams of fuck, shot from one side 
and from the other, seal vows I have not the faintest intention of 


keeping. 


Juliette -& 839 


However, since the first act of the play was to bring me to the 
catastrophe I was secretly planning, I hastened to stage that first 
act. Directed by me, Clotilda surprises her husband in her sister’s 
arms. But it is not to revenge herself solely upon the faithless one 
that I recommend, it is to immolate them both. 

“Yes, that is how I feel in the matter, and it concerns me,” I 
tell her. “I am too furious at what has been done to you not to 
sacrifice those who have inflicted this outrage. From now on your 
life itself shall be in danger from such monsters; you must either 
consent to their destruction or reconcile yourself to being destroyed 
by them.” 

An expressive silence is Clotilda’s response to this; and the 
same beverage rids her, at a stroke, of a sister and a husband... . 
I had fucked them both that morning. 

I turn now to the second act in the Burlington tragedy. 

“Oh, Clotilda,” I say, rushing to her in great terror, “these 
two sudden deaths have alarmed your father, I fear suspicion is 
wakening in his breast. Why would he not attribute the loss of his 
son-and-law and daughter to your vengeance, aware as he is of 
the motives that would lead you to seek it? Well, if he comes to a 
very obvious conclusion, you, my dear, are in a damnable case; you 
must have the best defense ready if this misfortune arises.” 

An hour later I am in conference with the father. 

“You are baffled, Sir? You search far afield for the assassin of 
Tilson and Cleontine, you need not look beyond Clotilda,” I 
pointed out to that honest man; ‘for whose interests are so closely 
associated with this horror? And if, as there is scarce any room for 
doubt, the wretch has been to this point capable of scorning her 
duties and the yet more powerful voice of Nature, presume the 
dire danger that must accrue to you in letting this tiger remain at 
your side.” 

To these calumnious assertions I add a string of spurious 
proofs; Milord is convinced; his daughter is taken into custody. My 
barrister hirelings fly to find her; they have no trouble persuading 
Clotilda that some recrimination is imperative, everything needed 
to support the counterattack is furnished her. This interesting crea- 
ture entreats me not to abandon her; her hand, if I deign accept it, 
will be the reward for my loyalty. I swear to hold steadfast by her, 


840 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


come what may. Burlington, sharply suspected of the crime he 
ascribes to his daughter, is dragged promptly before his judges; he 
is, at my instigation and at my expense, himself accused of having 
had treacherously murdered his daughter and son-in-law, and of 
having had Clotilda imprisoned as guilty of an atrocity he alone 
has committed. The trial created enough stir in London to last only 
a month; and in that brief period I had the satisfaction of freeing 
from behind bars her for whose sake I had perpetrated my terrible 
acts, and of seeing their third victim expire. 

“Clotilda,” I cried, once gratitude had brought that lovely 
woman to my feet, ‘make haste, claim your inheritance; having no 
child by Tilson you unfortunately cannot pretend to anything there, 
but realize what belongs to you and let us be off. Our conduct will 
not bear too close scrutiny, let us not wait for eyes to open but get 
us speedily away from here.” 

‘Oh, Borchamps, it is a terrible thing for me, to owe my life 
only to my father’s death!” 

“Ha, an end to idiot remorse, stifle it directly,” was my quick 
reply to my charming mistress; ‘remind yourself that your father 
aspired only to your doorn, and that any measure enforced by self- 
preservation is warrantecl.” 

‘But you shall at least be there, Borchamps, to dry away my 
tears?” 

“Can you doubt it, dear angel ?” 

‘‘Ah, then call a priest, let the ceremony be for tomorrow; let 
wedlock’s sweet pleasures crown us the same day, and the next 
morning let sunrise see us set forth from a land where the conse- 
quences of this horrible affair might at any moment turn to our 
disadvantage.” 

All is done as I desire it, and Clotilda is my wedded wife. 
Clotilda’s mourning for 1er first husband had been too brief for 
us to dare publish our marriage, but it nonetheless received the 
sanction of the law, human and divine. 

I wish here to make it very plain that Clotilda cannot be con- 
sidered even partly responsible for any of the pieces of mischief I 
have just related to you. The passive instrument of my maneuvers, 
she was in no wise their cause; no, I shall not hear of that gentle 
and charming person being blamed for anything that had befallen: 


Juliette 841 


the murder of her sister and husband, to which she had consented 
only through silence, was all alone my doing, she was still less guilty 
of her father’s death, and had it not been for my interventions, my 
briberies, perjurers and the rest, she would surely have gone to the 
gallows instead of Burlington. , 

All this I am at pains to say lest in the eyes of my auditors 
there be lost to Clotilda’s character one jot of the candor, modesty, 
or rectitude I accorded her when first I gave her description. And 
so also it was that however I might reason with her, she remained 


forever the prey of remorse; it is true that the manner whereby I | 


acquiesced in the love she confessed for me did for a while attenu- 


ate her sufferings from that quarter. But let me repeat it once and © 


for all, so long as the sequence of events obliges me to speak of her, 


never visualize Clotilda as anything but conscience-stricken, guilt- 


ridden. As such appearing to me a thousand times more piquant, 


she gave me the most extraordinary inspirations. Who would be- | 
lieve it? Even before enjoying her charms I thought to profane | 
them. Clotilda was no sooner my wife than I hardened over the 


twofold idea of fucking her in a brothel that first night and of 
prostituting her charms to the first comer. 
Early on in my stay at London I had made the acquaintance of 


a celebrated procuress at whose house I used to sport with the ~ 
prettiest rascals in town, to compensate myself for the monotonies | 
entailed by a regular intrigue. I go off to find Miss Bawil, I impart — 


to her my resolutions, she answers for their success; in the bargain 
I put the clause that the libertines to whom Clotilda is to be sur- 


rendered confine themselves to pollutions, nastiness, and brutalities. | 
Everything arranged »etween us, I return to Clotilda and propose © 


that after the wedding ceremony we consummate our marriage else- 


where than in this mansion fraught with gloomy memories; a_ 
friend, I tell her, has invited us to stay the night. Trusting Clotilda | 
accompanies me to Miss Bawil’s, where a merry feast is spread | 
before us. Someone less a scoundrel than I would have enjoyed this | 


moment during which happiness displaced Clotilda’s chagrins and 
she was oblivious to all save the charm of belonging to me. The 
poor fool was kissing me tenderly in her joy when three rascals 
posted by break suddenly in upon us, daggers in their hands. 

“Run for your life!” they say to me. ‘‘Begone and leave this 


842 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


woman to us, we’ve some frolicking to do before you get to her.” 

I flee from the room and pass into an adjoining one whence, 
through a spyhole, I am able to observe everything. Clotilda, half 
in a swoon, is promptly stripped by these rufians who expose her 
naked to my gaze. The effect was enchanting as libertinage here 
performed the usual office of love. "T'was thus profaned I had my 
first glimpse of the graces with which Nature had endowed the ex- 
quisite creature, ’twas thus the world’s most beauteous ass was re- 
vealed to my lascivious stare. A superb courtesan was frigging me 
in the meantime, and at a previously arranged signal the outrages 
redoubled. Clotilda, sprawled over the knees of one of the three 
was flagellated by the other two, after that condemned to the most 
lubricious and the most humiliating penances. Obliged to tongue the. 
asshole of one, she had also, at the same time, to frig the other two. 
Her face—that moving emblem of her sensitive soul—her breast, 
her lily-white and rosy breast, were washed by the impure jets of 
that unholy trio’s ardor, who, so instructed by me and to humiliate 
the heavenly creature’s virtue that much more thoroughly, ended 
by pissing and shitting upon her body while I proceeded to embug- 
ger another whore sen: to complete my excitement during the 
scene. Quitting this second girl’s ass without having discharged 
there, I pick up a rapier and rush into the dining room; I look as 
though I have returned at the head of reinforcements, I rescue 
Clotilda, my bought rufhans take to their heels and, casting myself 
theatrically at my beloved’s feet, ‘““Oh, dearest soul,” I cry, ‘‘have 
I not arrived too late? May not these monsters have already—” 

“No, my friend,” replies Clotilda as she is being wiped and 
made tidy, “no, your wite is still worthy of you—humiliated, mis- 
treated for a certainty, but not dishonored. Oh, Borchamps, why 
ever did you bring me to this house ?” ; 

“Ah, be calm, my angel, all danger is past. Miss Bawil has 
enemies, this untimely incursion was their work; but my call for 
help was heard, the house freed, and we can spend the rest of the 
night here in safety.” 

Clotilda was not easily reassured; at length, however, she re- 
covered from her experience and we betook ourselves to bed. 
Greatly heated by the scene I had lately provoked, astonishingly 
electrified to hold beauty, virtue sullied in my arms, I wrought

prodigies of vigor... . While this charming creature wanted some- 
thing of her sister’s disorderly imagination, she made up for that 
shortcoming by a more just, more lucid spirit and by an infinitely 
fetching beauty of physical detail. It would be impossible to be 
fairer of skin, better made of body, impossible to have sweeter, 
more winsome, more tantalizing parts. Clotilda absolutely untu- 
tored in lubricity and new to its pleasures, was ignorant even of the 
possibility of traveling Cythera’s narrower bypath. 

“My angel, a husband must find some first fruits to pluck on 
the wedding night; having none but these,” said I, touching her 
asshole, “you will surely not refuse them to me.” ; 

So saying I catch a good grip on her flanks and from sodomiz- 
ing her five times in succession bring my seed to a boil; it was how- 
ever in her cunt I deposited it. And ’twas there and then that 
Clotilda, luckier or more ardent with me than with Tilson, con- 
ceived a very unlucky daughter, who due to my inconstancy and 
neglect, I never saw at her birth. 

Dawn found me so tired of my goddess that had I consulted 
my sentiments alone, Clotilda would indeed never have got out of 
London; but, persuaded that this creature could perhaps be useful 
during my travels, we readied ourselves for departure. Helped by 
me, Clotilda assembled her fortune, it came to twelve thousand 
guineas all told and, taking them with us, I and my wife left Lon- 
don two years to the day after I had first set foot there. 

Since I was ever bent on visiting the courts of the North we 
now headed for Sweden. We had already been traveling some nine 
or ten weeks when one day, looking back over our adventures to- 
gether, Clotilda hazarded a few reproachful remarks upon the 
violence of the means I had employed to win her. My prompt reply 
was framed in such language as to give my dear wife very clearly 
to understand that I was perfectly ready to have her commit crimes 
but by no means prepared to see her repent them. Clotilda’s tears 
flowed forth afresh; I then revealed to her the whole truth of 
what had happened. 

“And every single part of it,” I told her in conclusion, “was 
my handiwork; the desire to be rid of your sister and your husband, 
both overmuch fucked by me; that of fucking you too and of ap- 
propriating your money by killing your father: such, my sweet,

were the real motives behind all my enterprises. Whence you will 
observe that in all this I have toiled for none but my own sake, and 
not one instant for yours. To this I may usefully add, dear creature, 
that my intention being to plunge into a very nefarious career, I did 
not unite you to my destiny in order to have you thwart that aim, 
but to promote it.” 

“In that case, what is the distinction you draw, Sir, between 
a slave and a wife?” 

“And you, tell me now, what distinction do you draw between 
a slave and a wife?” 

“Ah, Borchamps, why did you not take this line the very first 
day I met you? How bitter have now become the tears you force 
me to shed over my unhzppy family!” 

“No more weeping, Madame,” was my harsh warning to her, 
“and no more illusions concerning your fate; I expect utter submis- 
sion from you. If it so pleased me to have the carriage stopped this 
instant and to have you suck the prick of the man who’s driving it, 
you'd suck that prick, my dear, you’d suck it. For if you did not, 
I’d blow your brains out on the spot.” 

“My God, Borchamps! Is this love?” 

‘Why, I do not love you, Madame, what an idea. I have never 
loved you; I wanted your money and your ass, I have them both, 
and it may not be long before I have had altogether enough of the 
latter.” 

‘And the fate then in store for me will probably be the one 
Cleontine met?” 

“With you I shall probably resort to less mystery and surely 
a great deal more artistry.” 

At this point Clotilda thought to use the weapons of her sex: 
she leaned toward me in an effort to kiss and sprinkle me with her 
tears; I thrust her rudely away. 

“Cruel man,” she said, half-choked by her sobs, “‘if you wish 
to offend the mother at least respect the poor creature who owes its 
life to your love: I am pregnant . . . I beg you to stop at the first 
town we come to, for I do not feel at all well.” 

We did indeed stop and Clotilda, who took directly to bed, 
fell gravely ill. Irritated at having to interrupt my journey and at 
being delayed by a creature for whom I was beginning to have the

keenest distaste, to which there had to be added the loathing where- 
with I had always beheld pregnant women, I was on the point of 
taking a charitable leave of them both, she and her child, when a 
woman who was staying in a chamber near ours, stopped me in the 
hallway and bade me come for a moment into her room. Great 
heavens! what was my surprise upon recognizing Princess Sophia’s 
pretty confidante, the same Emma of whom I spoke a short while 
ago. 

‘What an unexpected encounter, Madame,” said I, ‘“‘and what 
a fortunate one! But are you here by yourself ?”. 

“I am indeed,” that charming personage replied, “I too have 
had to flee from an insatiable, ambitious mistress whom it must 
become damnation to serve. Well-advised you were, Borchamps, 
to have been of such firm resolve! You did not then know and may 
still be unaware of the chores her perfidious politics were reserving 
for you. She told you the Stadtholder was party to her scheme; she 
lied; her intention was to have you put that prince out of the way, 
and had the attempt failed you would have been a dead man. In 
despair after your escape, nevertheless she continued to harbor her 
wicked designs for another two years, and finally insisted that I 
undertake the murder she was meditating. Had it been a question 
merely of an ordinary crime, I would doubtless have executed it, 
for crime amuses me; | enjoy the shock it imparts to the mechanism, 
its effervescence delights me, and rid as I am of all prejudice, I 
give myself over to it without qualms before or regrets afterward; 
but a deed so important as that one—well, discretion is the better 
part of valor and I followed your example in order that having 
declined to be her accomplice, I not become her victim.” 

“Charming woman,” said I, putting my hand in Emma’s 
bosom, “‘let us banish all ceremony, we are nearly enough ac- 
quainted for it to be of no purpose. Let me tell you once again, dear 
angel, how very pleased I am to have found you again. Restrained 
by the exigent Sophia, we were unable to act in accordance with 
what we felt for each other; here, however, nothing hinders us—” 

“You say so, my friend; but this woman accompanying you, 
might one know who she is?” 

“She is my wife.” 

And I hasten to recount to my new friend the whole of the 


846 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


London story, and how I whittled the Burlington family down to 
the sole survivor now lying sick in another room of this inn. Emma, 
a great rascal at heart, saw all the humor in the adventure and 
when she was done laughing asked if I would not introduce her to 
my tender spouse. 

“Surely, you shall not go on dragging her about forever,” she 
said to me, “leave her here, I’m a more suitable companion for you 
than this prude. And I ask no sacraments from you, not I. I’ve al- 
ways detested Church ceremonies. Although noble-born, but a lost 
woman through my debauchery and thanks to my attachment to 
Sophia, from you I want only the title of mistress and dearest 
friend. How are your finances ?” 

“In the very best order. I am extremely rich.” 

“A pity. I have one hundred thousand crowns and was count- 
ing upon offering them to you, thinking thereby to get you some- 
what into my power, which would be agreeable to me.” 

“I dare say, Emma, and I am touched by your delicacy, but it 
is not in this manner you would ever get me into bondage; mine is 
too lofty a soul to consent to dependence upon a woman: I must 
either dominate her or not use her at all.” 

“Why, very well then, I shall be your whore, I like that role; 
how much will you pay me a month?” 

‘‘What did you get from Sophia ?” 

“The value of one hundred French louis.” 

“I will give you the same; but you will be faithful? Submis- 
sive ?” 

““Asa slave.” 

“Slavery implies that you be dispossessed of the tokens of 
freedom and the means to fail your master. Hand your funds over 
to me.” 

“Here they are,” and Emma fetched me her casket. 

“But, my angel,” said I, raising the lid, “‘you must have stolen 
this sum: with one hundred Jouis a month you could not possibly 
have composed this fortune, Emma, not at your age.” 

‘Do you suppose I left that Messalina without first giving her 
treasury a feel?” 

“And if I were to do unto thee that which thou hast done ?”’ 

“Borchamps, I love you, what I have is yours; I am not en- 


’

trusting my money to you, I am giving it; but this gift and my 
favors are not to be had save upon one condition.” 

‘And that condition ?”’ 

“It is that we be this very instant rid of the drab piece of 
baggage you are towing across Europe.” 

‘You are paying me for her death?” 

‘That is what I demand in exchange for my hundred thousand 
crowns.” 

“Exquisite little minx! The idea is amusing; but the project 
must be embellished by a few rather severe episodes.” 

“Tll though she is ?” 

“But the object is to do her in, is it not ?”” 

“To be sure.” 

‘Well, come along, I shall present you as an irate wife who 
demands that I return to her; I shall excuse myself for a fit of 
blind passion which, in my embarrassed situation, forced me to 
behave in my mysterious manner; you will fulminate; I shall be 
obliged to tell her that I am abandoning her, and the poor woman 
will die of chagrin, she and the infant inside her.” 

“She is pregnant?” 

“Indeed she is.” 

‘““Why, we shall have a jolly time!” And in Emma’s sparkling 
eyes I saw how this villainy was arousing her; the whore is over- 
come by emotion, she kisses me, a paroxysm shakes loose her fuck. 
... We enter. 

So well did we play our parts that the wretched Clotilda 
swallowed everything down to the dregs. Emma, witty, malicious, 
and a wicked tease, maintained that when I’d deserted her I’d also 
robbed her, and that not a button or a handkerchief in the room 
belonged by rights to this bedridden adventuress. I agreed that all 
this was indubitably so, and my sorrowful wife, only too well aware 
of the black situation menacing her, turned her beautiful face away 
to hide her weeping. 

‘Oh no, sir traitor, I shall not let you out of my sight,” Emma 
declared with great energy, “I am not going to budge from here, 
for I intend to get my due.” 

Supper is brought into the room. Emma and I eat heartily 
and call for the best wines in the house while the helpless Clotilda 


848 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


watches herself being stripped, plundered to the last penny, and 
stares at the prospect of soon having nothing left to feed upon but 
her despair and her tears. Our copious repast finished, it was upon 
the foot of the forlorn soul’s bed that we celebrated the pleasure 
of our reunion. 

A pretty thing she was, that Emma; twenty-one years old, a 
face that personified voluptuousness itself, the figure of a nymph, 
great dark eyes, the freshest mouth, the whitest teeth, the most 
cunning little tongue, the fairest and smoothest skin, marvelously 
molded in breast and buttock, a libertine too, and in the highest 
degree, with all the salt and all the spitefulness of cruel lubricity. 
We fucked deliciously in every style and manner while battening 
upon the spectacle, equally rare and stimulating, of my wife wrung 
by moans, grief, and anxiety. 

As I was embuggering her, Emma would have her unfortunate 
rival show us her ass. Clotilda was almost too sick, too exhausted 
to move; howbeit, obey she must. I slapped that splendid behind 
whereof I had made such feast of late and which I was now so 
unkindly abandoning; I smote it so hard that the poor woman, 
weak from distress, from pain, from 4llness, lay motionless upon 
the bed. 

“We could strangle her,’ 
great zest. 

“We could, but it would be a serious mistake,” replied the 
clever and imaginative girl; “far better simply to abandon her more 
or less alive, to damage her reputation with the innkeeper, and to 
make sure that, left without resources, she will either perish from 
hunger or try to survive from libertinage.” 

This last idea having caused me a prodigious discharge, we 
made ready to depart. We removed every last object from the 
room; we despoiled Clotilda even of her nightgown; we plucked 
even the rings off her fingers, unscrewed the rings from her ears, 
took even her shoes, her slippers, in a word, she was left as naked 
as the day she was born; the poor dear wept and said the most 
melting things to me. 

“Alas, short of murdering me, you could not carry barbarity 
any farther. May heaven forgive you as do I; and whatever be the 


* said I, bum-fucking Emma with 


Juliette bb» 849 


career you follow, give a thought sometimes to the woman who 
never did you any wrong unless it was to love you too much.” 

“Come, come, cheer up,” said Emma, “‘all you have to do to 
earn some money is frig some pricks. Why, instead of blaming us 
you ought to thank us: along with the rest we could deprive you of 
life. Count your blessings.” 

The horses were harnessed, the carriage waiting at the door. 
As we were about to mount Emma had a word with the people of 
the inn. 

“The creature we are leaving behind up there,” she told them, 
“is an arrant whore who stole my husband; as chance would have it, 
I came upon him in this place: I recover what is mine by law and 
right and, together with him, am taking away the belongings that 
slut robbed from me. Here is her lodging and board, paid up 
until today, I'll answer for no more: do with her whatever you 
see fit, she has all she needs to settle any debts she may incur from 
you and to return home to her own country. And here is the key to 
her room; adieu.” 

The coachman cracked his whip and we whirled off without 
waiting to learn what happened next in an adventure which now 
ceased to hold anything of interest for us. 

“I am most content,” said Emma. “Your management of this 
affair reveals a character very kindred to mine; I already feel 
attached to you. How do you suppose it will fare with Madame?” 

“She will beg alms or render lewd services; what matter is it 
tous?” 

And to turn the conversation upon a worthier theme, I 
besought Emma to tell me a little more about herself. 

“I was born in Brussels,” the splendid creature began; “never 
mind from what lineage I come, know simply that my parents are 
persons of foremost rank in that city. When yet very young I was 
sacrificed to an unendurable husband; the man I loved picked a 
quarrel with him and on their way to the dueling-ground, slew him 
from behind. ‘I am lost,’ my lover said to me, ‘I lent too much heed 
to vengeance, now I must flee. If you love me, Emma, come away 
with me; I am not poor, we shall have enough to live in peace and 
ease for the rest of our days.’ 


850 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Oh, Borchamps, could I refuse a man whom my advice had 
undone ?” 

“This murder was of your devising?” 

“Are you in a doub:, my dear, and should I disguise anything 
from you? I followed my lover into exile; he failed me; I had the 
same trick played upon him he had played upon my husband. 
Sophia learned of my story; she was much taken by my crime. . 
was soon adoring my person. The development of my character 
pleased her, we rubbed cunts; I was initiated into all her secrets; 
"tis to her I am indebted for all the principles in which I am un- 
shakable today: although in the end I robbed her, it is no less true 
that I had a constant affection for the Princess. The outstanding 
libertinage of her mind, the warmth of her imagination, oh, the 
basis of my attachment to her was sound; and had it not been for 
the dread her final proposals caused me, I might perhaps have 
remained with her for the rest of my life.” 

“It may be, Emma, that I know you better than you know 
your own self: you would quickly have become tired of being no 
more than the pawn of the crime of others, you would have begun 
to want to commit it on your own behalf, and, sooner or later, you 
would have left that woman. Is she jealous ?” 

“Frightfully.” 

“She did at least permit you women ?” 

‘Never any except those she involved in her pleasures.” 

“I repeat it, Emma, you would not have lived long with 
Sophia.” 

“Oh, my friend, I give thanks to the fate which delivered me 
out of her hands and into yours; let us be ever mindful of the honor 
that prevails amongst thieves, exert our craft upon everybody else, 
but never turn it against each other.” 

Pretty though Emma was, and despite the analogy between 
her character and mine, I was not yet sure enough of myself to be 
able to guarantee an exact balance in the association she desired, 
and I left her to interpret my silence in whatever way she chose. 
For indeed, was there a single crime in the world I could engage 
myself not to commit? 

~ However, our liaison grew stronger, we reached certain un- 
derstandings; their first basis was the inviolable and mutual 


Juhette & 851 


promise never to lose an occasion to do evil, to contrive such 
occasions whenever it was in our power; it was likewise agreed that 
the fruit of our common thievings and rapine would always be 
evenly shared. 

We had gone hardly twenty leagues when we were presented 
with an opportunity to put our maxims into action and our oaths. 
to the test. We were traversing Gotaland and were in the neighbor- 
hood of the town of Jonkoping when a French carriage driving 
ahead of us struck a wheel into the rut and broke the axle. The 
master, whose valet was in charge of the advance horses, had 
nought to do but get down and wait with his baggage by the road- 
side till help should come. This help we offered when we drew 
abreast of him, and learned that the man was a French merchant 
going to Stockholm on business for his company, who were well- 
known traders. Villeneuil’s age was twenty-three and never had 
anyone so pretty a face; together with his charming outside he had 
all the candor and sincerity of his nation. 

‘“‘A thousand thanks for your kindness in offering me a seat 
in your carriage to the nearest post,”’ said he. “I am all the more 
obliged to you forasmuch as in this chest I am carrying objects of 
major importance: diamonds, gold, bills of exchange I have been 
commissioned by three Paris firms to deliver to their Swedish 
correspondents. You can imagine the state I would be in were I to 
have the misfortune of losing such things.” 

“Why, Sir, if that be the case we are in great good luck to be 
able to ensure the safety of such precious effects,” said Emma. 
‘Will you see fit to entrust them to us and bestow upon us the 
honor of saving you from your predicament and your fortune from 
eventual marauders?” 

Villeneuil climbs in; we recommend that his postilion guard the 
carriage and team until the young man is able to send his valet back 
with fresh horses and someone to repair the damage. 

No sooner had we started off with our charming prey than 
Emma covertly sought my hand... . 

‘‘Agreed,” I murmured in an undertone, “‘but this calls for a | 
few episodes.” 

‘‘Assuredly,” said she. 

And on we drove. 


852 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Having come to the little town of Vimmerby we found Ville- 
neuil’s lackey at the posting station and sent him back in all haste 
after his master’s equipage. 

‘You were doubtless intending to stay the night here?” I said 
to the young man. “We ourselves cannot, since we must endeavor 
to reach Stockholm as soon as possible; so we shall let you down, 
Sir, and take our leave of you now.” 

To this the ardent Villeneuil, who had, not without emotion, 
been gazing at the charms of my friend, replied with a look seem- 
ing to express regret that we should be parting so soon; spying the 
shadow come across his countenance, Emma quickly spoke up, say- 
ing that indeed, she did not see why it was necessary to say such 
an early goodbye, and that since we had been enjoying our journey 
together, why might we not all continue on to the capital? 

“Yes, and why not?” said I. “This then is what I would 
suggest: Monsieur will leave a message here at the posting station, 
instructing his valet to join him at the Hotel de Danemark, where 
we shall be stopping in Stockholm. Thereby everything is arranged 
and we remain together.” 

‘‘An infinitely welcome suggestion,” says the young man, cast- 
ing a sidelong glance at Emma, who by means of one just as im- 
passioned announces that she is in no wise sorry to see him fall in 
with any proposal which might lead to a lessening of the distance 
between them. 

Villeneuil scribbles a letter, it is handed to the innkeeper, our 
horses are watered, then we fly on toward Stockholm. We had 
another thirty leagues still to cover; we arrived the following eve- 
ning and ’twas only then my companion informed me of the ruse she 
had devised to ensure the execution of the deed we were meditating. 
The rascal, excusing herself under the pretext of having to attend 
to a need, had dismounted from the carriage at Vimmerby and 
quickly written out a message of her own; she had substituted it 
for Villeneuil’s, and in hers prescribed to the lackey that he seek 
his master not at the Hotel de Danemark, but at The English 
Arms. 

Once in Stockholm her first care, as you may readily imagine, 
was to appease the young merchant’s inquietudes, who wondered 
why his carriage was being delayed; she did everything she felt 


Juliette 853 


most likely to make him easy and to dazzle him at the same time. 
Villeneuil had tumbled head over heels in love with her; the thing 
became plain beyond all doubt, and Emma accordingly staged a 
flawless performance; Villeneuil seemed jealous of me. 

“Needless to say, you are unwilling to have this turn into an 
adventure out of a popular novel,” Emma observed; “you desire 
me, Villeneuil, but love has nothing to do with your feelings. And 
I, moreover, cannot become yours; nothing on earth would ever 
induce me to leave Borchamps; he is my husband. Therefore be 
content with what I can offer you, and do not aspire after what I 
am unable to accord; and rest assured that provided we keep in- 
side those boundaries, my husband, a born libertine, is the man to 
join in our happiness: surrendering to it, we can perfectly well 
provide him the joy of one such lewd scene as he delights in. 
Borchamps has a fondness for men. You are extremely handsome, 
Sir; consent to avail him of your charms, only do that and I 
believe I can guarantee he will let you enjoy mine in peace.” 

“Do you think so?” 

“I am certain of it. This complaisance—it does not go too 
much against the grain?” 

“Not at all. It’s a practice from college days, I find nothing 
strange in seeing it preserved and am myself as much given to it as 
anyone else.” 

“And so it but remains to make the arrangements?” 

“You have my consent to everything, . . .” 

Whereupon the clever Emma flings open the closet in which I 
have been hiding. “‘Come along, Borchamps,” she cries, ‘‘Villeneuil 
offers you his ass, have supper brought up, then bar the door and 
let’s to our frolicking.” 

“Charming young man,” say I, stepping forth from conceal- 
ment and thrusting my tongue into the traveler’s mouth, albeit 
penetrated by the desire to kill him once I have fucked him, “your 
accommodation moves me. And as a matter of fact, is this not a 
very simple sort of transaction? I cede you my wife, you lend me 
your behind, why refrain from happiness when it may be so easily 
had?” 

Even as I spoke my friend was unbuttoning Villeneuil’s 
breeches; and if her delicate hands brought the world’s prettiest

prick into view, mine just as soon discovered the most sublime ass 
it is possible to see. Kneeling before that heavenly furniture, I was 
carried utterly away, and I would perhaps still be licking it, suck- 
ing it, had my dear Emma not called my attention away from it to 
have me admire the exquisite member wherewith our prey was 
provided in front. No sooner have I taken that superb engine in 
charge than I present him an ass which is burning from the desire 
to possess it. 

“Oh, Villeneuil!” I cried, “deign to begin with me; those 
charms you covet,” I went on, nodding toward Emma’s, “‘shall be 
yours directly you have rendered yourself master of my ass; such 
is the price of their having, they'll not be yours save you pay it.” 

I am fucked; that was all Villeneuil’s reply. I lift my mistress’ 
skirts for him, he fondles her, he kisses her while fucking me; 
unable to cope with his passions, the animal quits me to snap his 
dart into Emma’s panting cunt. Seeing his bum well inside my reach, 
I leap upon it and sodornize him to avenge the affront he has just 
offered me; he discharges; I waylay him as he retires from Emma’s 
cunt; finding him still sti:t enough for that, I clap him into my anus 
again, embugger Emma, and sweetest ecstasy crowns our pleasure 
anew; we begin again. Villeneuil encunts my friend, I embugger 
him; the whore flopped and thrashed about between the two of us 
for nearly two hours; V:lleneuil sticks her ass, I her cunt, I refuck 
Villeneuil, he refucks me back; the whole night, in a word, is 
passed in drunkenness and once it is dissipated worry breeds afresh. 

“Still no sign of mv valet,” says Villeneuil. 

‘It must be the repair of your carriage that is holding him 
up,” Emma replies; ‘“‘there could be no misreading your message, 
its terms were clear; so have a little patience. Besides, have you 
not got your most precious effects with you? You can perfectly 
well take them to their destination.” 

“I shall go tomorrow,” says Villeneuil. 

And as he was much spent from the pleasures of the night 
before, he went early to bed. 

Once he lay in the arms of sleep, I turned to Emma and said: 
“The time has come. Either we act now or this fellow’s immense 
riches slip from our grasp.” 


Juliette & 855 


‘Ah, my friend, we are in a hotel, what shall we do with the 
corpse ?”” 

“Cut it into pieces and burn them; this man is accompanied by 
nobody, nobody will come here to look for him. Thanks to the 
precautions you took, the valet will go hunting for him at the other 
end of town. We'll let him explain things in any way he wishes; he 
can demand inquiries, he can make them himself, I defy him to find 
hide or hair of his master: when we came through the city gates I 
gave our names to the guard and described Villeneuil as a footman 
in our hire. Well, we have dismissed the footman. There’s an end 
to it.” 

Then, opening the treasure chest with the key we had quietly 
taken out of Villeneuil’s pocket, and contemplating that enormous 
treasure of gold and precious stones, “Oh, my dear friend,” said I, 
“would we not be mad to hesitate a moment between the life of 
this fool and the possession of such riches ?” 

We were gloating over the spectacle when all of a sudden 
there came a knocking at the door. I shot a glance at Emma, shot 
another out of the window: great heavens! there in the street stood 
Villeneuil’s carriage. And here was his valet. The lout had dis- 
covered where we were, at The English Arms they had told him 
that since we were not among their guests, there must have been 
some error, and that we would surely be found elsewhere, probably 
at the Hotel de Danemark. As for hiding his master from him, 
"twas too late for that: as he walked in he saw Villeneuil lying 
asleep in his bed. 

“My good man,” I said, going straight up to the valet, and 
putting a finger to my lips, “take care lest you wake him; he has 
been having a bout of fever, it is of utmost importance that he 
rest; go back to the inn where you were, and be certain that if he 
sent you there in the first place it was for the very best of reasons: 
owing to the secret business he has in this city he cannot afford to 
have the same public lodgings as his servants. He very positively 
charged us to tell you, in the event you were to appear, to return to 
the address specified in the note which my wife wrote out at his 
dictation when we stopped at Vimmerby; you are to remain at The 
English Arms and await his further orders, without anticipating 
them, without coming here to find out what they are.” 


856 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘“‘Humph,” said the valet, ‘that suits me. I'll send the carriage 
back.” 

“Do so. Here is some money if you run short of it; don’t 
worry about your master, he is in good hands, and inside three 
days you will surely be hearing news.” 

Valet and carriage disappear; my companion and I discuss 
how now to proceed. 

“Let us start,” I say, ‘‘by following our initial scheme: we first 
get rid of this Villeneuil; once he is out of the way we shall have 
no trouble killing the valet, and this will get us the carriage, the 
horses, the rest of the baggage, which were not even in the bargain 
at the outset.” 

The unfortunate young man is cut up bit by bit, each is re- 
duced to ashes in a charcoal brazier until of Villeneuil not a trace 
remains ; and we, heated by the grisly deed we have just performed, 
pass the rest of the night in the filthiest debauch. In the morning I 
betook myself, alone, to The English Arms. 

‘“‘My friend,” said I to the valet, “I have instructions from 
your master to conduct you to where he is awaiting you in a house 
in the country, it lies two leagues from here; your effects may 
remain at the inn and as we leave, make it clear that they are not to 
be touched, unless I corne to fetch them, and in that case that they 
be turned over to me; let us make haste.” 

We set out from the city and when I have my man in the 
bleak and desolate parts that stand on the edge of Stockholm, “Off 
you go,” I say to the w-etch as I fire a ball into his brain, “ga look 
for your master in hell; ’tis there we send everyone who has money 
but lacks the intelligence to give it up before we take it from him.” 

With a kick I roll the dead body over the brink of a precipice 
and, my operation terminated, turn about to drive back to town 
when, on the farther side of the road, I spy a child of thirteen or 
fourteen tending a flock of sheep. 

“Eh, she must have seen me,” say I to myself, ‘‘she could not 
help but see me . . . did she see everything? . . . Ah, by God, let’s 
not waste time weighing the two sides of the question.” 

I seize the little shepherd, wrap a scarf around her head; I 
rape her; her two pucelages are blasted at a single stroke, I put a 
bullet into her head at the same instant I discharge in her ass.

There, say I to myself, very pleased with what I have done, 
that is the sure way of avoiding all trouble from a witness, and I 
drive swiftly back to The English Arms where I have Villeneuil’s 
horses hitched, his trunks loaded into his carriage, and everything 
brought round to our hotel. 

It was a silent Emma who greeted me there; I was disturbed 
by her air of worry. 

I demanded what the matter could be. “Is your nerve failing 
you?” 

“IT am uneasy about the consequences this affair may have,” 
she replied. ‘‘Villeneuil does not come to Stockholm without giving 
his correspondents foreknowledge of his arrival; they will wonder 
what has befallen him; he will be sought for at all the inns; ques- 
tions will be asked; the whole thing is bound to come out. And 
when it does, let us, my friend, be already gone from this dreadful 
country where everything frightens me nearly to death.” 

‘Emma, I thought you were of sterner stuff; if you are 
obliged to fly every time you commit a felony, you will never be able 
to settle down anywhere. Come, my dear, put away idle fears; 
Nature, who desires crimes, watches over those who commit them, 
and one is very rarely chastened for having abided by her laws. I 
have credentials recommending me to everyone of outstanding note 
in Sweden; I am going to present them, be sure that among all 
these new acquaintances there shall not be one who is unable to 
furnish us material and opportunity for fresh evil-doing; let us 
indeed be careful, but above all not to escape from the happy fate 
that awaits us.” 

At the time I was in Sweden, the capital, and the whole king- 
dom as well, was being shaken by the rivalry of two powerful 
parties: one, discontented with the Court, was straining for the day 
when it would seize power; the other, that of Gustavus III, seemed 
determined to stop at nothing in order to keep despotism en- 
throned; the Court and everything connected therewith made up 
this second faction. The first was composed of the Senate and of 
certain portions of the military. A new monarch had just begun his 
reign, and the malcontents felt this the propitious moment to swing 
into action: a dawning authority is more easily confronted than an 
entrenched one; the senators were aware of it and were planning to 


858 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


go to any lengths to secure the rights they had been striving for 
years to usurp; they exercised their constitutional prerogatives to 
the limit and even beyond, daring to open letters to the King in 
their public assemblies, and to answer or interpret them as they 
chose; little by little, the power of these magistrates had grown to 
the point where Gustavus could scarcely appoint men to office in his 
own realm. 

Such was the state of affairs in the country when I paid a call 
upon Senator Steno, the guiding spirit of the senatorial party. The 
young magistrate and his wife received me with demonstrations of 
the most agreeable politeness and, I dare add, of the liveliest 
interest. I was scolded for not having brought my wife the very 
first day; and ’twas only by accepting an invitation to dinner for 
the following day, at which both of us would be expected, that I 
succeeded in quieting young Steno’s reproaches. 

Emma, who passecl for my spouse and who combined all the 
features in which good society delights, was received with extreme 
cordiality; and the warmest friendship sprang up at once between 
that charming creature and the Senator’s engaging wife.* 

If the young Swede, twenty-seven years of age, could be 
rightly taken for one of the most winning, wealthiest, wittiest per- 
sons of his generation, one might without exaggeration declare 
that Ernestine, his lady, was very surely the prettiest creature to 
be found in all Scandinavia. Nineteen years, the loveliest blonde 
hair, the most majestic figure . . . the prettiest brown eyes, the 
sweetest and most delicately formed features, such were the endear- 
ing qualities wherewith Nature had embellished this angelic woman 
who, in addition to all these physical favors, possessed a fully 
adorned mind, the firmest character, and the soundest philosophy. 

At our fourth meeting Steno asked me to whom were ad- 
dressed the other letters of recommendation I had been given. I 
brought them all forth, and when upon the superscriptions he read 
the names of several courtiers, a frown darkened his face. 

‘“‘Amiable Frenchman and distinguished guest,” said he, hand- 
ing me back my sheaf of papers, “we must forego the pleasure of 
seeing anyone who comes bearing such credentials. Powerful inter-

ests divide my house from these where you are to go. The sworn 
enemies of the Court’s despotism, my colleagues, my friends, my 
relatives are not on speaking terms with those who serve or benefit 
from this despotism.” 

‘Ah, Monsieur,” said I, “your attitude conforms too closely 
to mine for me not, this very minute, to make the slight sacrifice of 
everything that would appear likely to bind me to the party of your 
opponents; I abhor kings and their tyranny. Is it even presumable 
that into such hands as this royal personage’s Nature can have 
entrusted the task of governing men? The ease with which a single 
individual may be seduced, deceived, does this not suffice to spoil 
any intelligent man’s taste for monarchy? Make haste, brave 
senators, restore to the Swedish people the liberty Gustavus seeks 
to wrest away from them, as his ancestors did before; may the 
efforts your young prince is now undertaking to increase his author- 
ity come to the same failure as those lately attempted by Adolphus. 
But, good my Lord,” I continued heatedly, “lest in future any doubt 
remain in your mind as to the sincerity of the promise I make you 
to embrace your party and uphold it for the rest of my sojourn 
upon Swedish soil, here are the letters I was to carry to Gustavus’ 
supporters and clients, here they are, I say, let us, you and I, throw 
them into the grate, yes, all of them, and allow me to leave up to 
you the choice of friends with whom I am to consort while in your 
city.” 

2 Steno clasps my hand, and his young wife, witness to this con- 
versation, is unable to prevent herself from showing how greatly 
flattered she is to have attracted to her party so essential a man 
as I. 

“Borchamps,” Steno said, “after this declaration, which so 
plainly comes from the heart, I can have no doubt of your way of 
thinking. Are you indeed capable of adopting our interests as your 
own, of binding yourself to us by all the ties which identify friends 
and sinew a conspiracy ?” 

“Senator,” I replied with vehemence, “before you now and 
upon my life I do hereby swear to stand fast in the fight until the 
last of the tyrants shall be wiped off the face of the earth, if the 
weapon for their destruction is put into my hand by you.” 

And I thereupon recounted my experience with the Princess 


860 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of Holland, fit proof to demonstrate my abhorrence of tyranny and 
of those who wield it. 

“My friend,” the Senator said to me, “is your wife’s attitude 
in this the same as yours ?” 

“To that question the answer is unambiguous: they were for 
reasons similar to mine that she left a Sophia who lavished favors 
upon her.” 

“Very well then,” said Steno, “my comrades sup tomorrow 
night at my house, join us, both of you, and you will discover 
certain startling things.” 

I related this interview to Emma. 

“Before entangling us in this, my friend, consider well where 
it may lead; and I would ask you not to forget that when you 
refused to serve Sophia’s cause, you were acting a great deal less, 
as it appears to me, from partisan spirit than through aversion for 
political affairs.” 

“No,” I rejoined, “you err; I have since given the matter 
very close thought, and realized that it was uniquely my lifelong 
horror of the despotism’ of a single person which drove me to turn 
my back upon the Stadtholder’s wife; had her aims been different, 
I might perhaps have agreed to everything. . . .” 

“But see here, Borchamps,”’ Emma protested, “‘your principles 
seem to me without rhyme or reason: you are a tyrant yourself, 
and you detest tyranny; despotism breathes in your tastes, in your 
heart, permeates your soul, and you assail its tenets; explain me 
these contradictions or cease to count upon me to follow you.” 

“Emma,” said I to my companion, “penetration will here 
suffice; listen to what I am going to tell you, and remember it well. 
If the Senate is ready to rise in arms against Sweden’s sovereign, 
it is not from horror of tyranny but from envy at seeing despotism 
exercised by another than itself; once it has got the power into its 
hands you will see a sudclen transformation wrought in its attitude, 
and they who hate despotism today will use it to perfect their hap- 
piness tomorrow. In accepting Steno’s proposal, I play the same 
role as he and, like him, I am eager not to shatter the scepter, but 
to wield it to my advantage. And I tell you this which you may 
also remember: I shall part company with this society the instant 
I notice it animated by any other principles or tending in any other 


Juliette & 861 


direction; and so, Emma, of contradictions you need accuse me 
no more, nor those whom you see combating tyranny by despotism 
only: the throne is to everybody’s taste, and ’tis not the throne 
they detest, but him who is seated on it. I sense in myself certain 
dispositions to take a hand in worldly affairs; to succeed therein 
one needs neither prejudices nor virtues; a brazen front, a cor- 
rupted soul, an unflinching character, all these I have; fortune 
beckons to me, I heed the call. Put on fine array tomorrow, Emma, 
be proud, clever, and sluttish, those, I gage, are the qualities that 
will be necessary in Steno’s house, they are the ones which will 
please my confederates, show them, you have them; and there is 
this last : tremble at nothing.” 

We are there at the appointed hour and having been admitted 
at the gate overhear a lackey say to the porter: ‘These are the 
last who'll be coming; let nobody else in.” 

Beside this vast palace was a garden, and the society was 
gathered in a pavilion located at its farther end; tall trees shrouded 
this spot which one might have taken for a temple raised to the 
god of silence. A servant points the way without escorting us 
thither; we follow the path, enter the pavilion. 

The assembly, apart from ourselves, numbered eight persons. 
Steno and his wife, with whom I have already acquainted you, 
rose to greet us and present us to the others I shall now describe. 
They were three senators and their three wives. The eldest of the 
men must have been fifty, his name was Ericsson: he had an air 
of stateliness and majesty, but there was something hard in his 
glance and cutting in his speech. His wife was named Fredegunda, 
she was thirty-five, had more beauty than graciousness, features 
bordering on the masculine, but proud; what, in a word, they call a 
handsome woman. The second senator was forty years of age and 
called Volf: here were prodigious vivacity, very considerable wit, 
but a wickedness apparent in every line and detail. Amelia, his wife, 
was scarce twenty-three; ‘twas there the most piquant face, the most 
agreeable figure, the sweetest mouth, the most roguish eye, the 
fairest skin in all the world; one cannot be all this and at the 
same time have a mind more lively and an imagination more ardent; 
nor be more libertine, nor more delicious. I was struck by Amelia, 
I do not pretend otherwise. The third senator was named Brahe, 


862 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


he was surely less than thirty years old, slender, spare, crafty of 
eye, alert, quick, unsettled of gesture, and looked to be all his 
confreres’ better in rigor, cynicism, and ferocity. Ulrika, his wife, 
was one of the most beautiful women in Stockholm, but simul- 
taneously the most mischievous and the most vicious, the most 
attached to the Senatorial Party, and the most capable of leading 
it to victory; she was two years younger than her husband. 

“Friends,” said Steno once the doors were bolted and the 
shutters drawn, “had I not thought this French gentleman and 
his lady worthy of us “hey would not be present in our midst; 
I therefore urgently request you to admit them into our Society.” 

“Sir,” said Brahe, addressing himself to me in a tone at once 
forceful and dignified, ‘‘what Steno tells us about you is encouraging 
and inspires confidence. this confidence however will be better 
established by the answers you give in public to the various 
questions that are now going to be put to you.” 

He then asked: “What are your motives for hating the 
despotism of kings ?” 

To this I replied: ‘Envy, jealousy, ambition, pride, rage at 
being dominated, my own desire to tyrannize others.’* 

He: ‘Does the we.fare and happiness of nations enter as a 
consideration into your views?” 

I: “I am concerned solely for mine own.” 

He: ‘“‘And what role do the passions play in your manner of 
regarding all things political ?” 

I: “The leading and most vital one; according to my belief, 
every one of those individuals known as statesmen pursues now, 
and has always pursued, no other veritable objective, is now and 
has always been moved by no other veritable intention than to 
satisfy his voluptuous inclinations to the full; his plans, the 
alliances he forms, his schemes, his taxes, everything, his laws 
included, everything is bent toward his personal felicity, for the 
public’s well-being there can be no room in his meditations, and 
what the dizzard people see him do is never done save to render 
him mightier or richer.” 

He: “So that if you were mighty or rich you would turn 


4 Say, O genius of the Stockholm revolution, didst thou not go to school in Paris? 


Juliette 2» 863 


these two advantages nowhere but to those of your pleasures or 
your follies ?” 

I: “They are the only gods I recognize, the only delights of 
my soul.” 

He: “And religion, how do you visualize it in regard to all 
this-?”’ 

I: “As the mainstay of tyranny, that mechanism which the 
despot must always set in motion when he wishes to strengthen 
his throne. The flame of superstition was ever the aurora of 
despotism, and it is always by means of consecrated irons that the 
tyrant breaks the people to his will.” 

He: “And so you exhort us to the use of religion ?”’ 

I: “Certainly, if you are of a mind to reign, let a God speak 
in your behalf and men will obey you. When, God’s wrath in your 
hire or your hands, you have brought them to their knees, their 
money and their lives are as good as yours. Persuade them that all 
the woes they have suffered under the regime you wish them to 
repudiate have come from nought but their irreligion. Cause them 
to tumble at the feet of the hobgoblin you brandish before them; 
prostrate, they will serve as steppingstones to your ambition, your 
pride, your lust.” 

He: “You yourself do not believe in God ?” 

I: “Is there a single rational being on earth who can credit 
such lies? Nature, forever in movement, has she any need of a 
mover ? Would that the living body of the first charlatan to mouth 
talk of this execrable chimera could be abandoned to the shades 
of all those poor wretches who have perished on its account.” 

He: “How do you consider the actions that are denominated 
criminal ?” 

I: “As Nature’s inspirations to which resistance is madness; 
as the surest means a statesman can employ to accumulate the 
substance of happiness and safeguard it; as essential to the work- 
ings of all governments; ds the sole laws of Nature.” 

He: ‘Have you committed crimes of every sort ?” 

I: “There is not one wherewith I am not stained, and which 
I am not ready to stain myself with again.” 

Here Brahe outlined the history of the Templars. After an 
energetic commentary upon the death, both unjust and atrocious, 


864 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to which Philip the Fair put their last Grand Master, Molay, 
for the sole purpose of laying hands upon the Order’s property: 

“In us you see,” he said to me, “the leaders of that Northern 
Lodge which Molay himself instituted even as he awaited his doom 
in a cell of the Bastille. If we accept you into our midst it is only 
upon the most express condition that, upon the victim about to be 
presented to you, you swear to avenge our great founder, and at 
the same time to fulfill the clauses of the oath here set forth. 
Recite it aloud and intelligibly.” 

‘I do hereby swear,” said I, reading from the vellum, “to 
exterminate all kings till none remain alive on earth; to wage in- 
cessant war against the Catholic religion and the Papacy; to preach 
liberty for all the world’s peoples; and to strive to build a universal 
republic.” 

An awful clap of thunder dinned deafeningly; the pavilion 
rattled upon its foundations; the victim rose up through a trap 
in the floor, in his two hands lay the poniard with which I was to 
smite him; he was a fair youth of sixteen years, entirely nude. 
I take the profferred weapon, I drive the blade into his heart. 
Brahe comes up with a golden chalice, gathers the blood, has me 
drink first thereof, presents the goblet to the others one by one, 
and each drinks, pronouncing a barbarous phrase whose meaning 
is this: We shall die rather than break faith with one another. The 
platform descends, the cadaver disappears, and Brahe resumes his 
interrogation. 

“You have just now,” says he, “shown yourself worthy of us; 
you have seen that we are of the same intrepid stuff we require 
in you, and that our wives are likewise dauntless. Are you so care- 
less of the crime you have just committed as to be able to employ 
it even in your pleasures ?” 

I: “It augments them, it electrifies them; I have always re- 
garded murder as the soul of libidinous delights; its effects upon 
the imagination are enormous, and lubricity is as nought unless 
depravity of spirit fuel its fire.” 

He: “Do you admit of restrictions in the taking of physical 
pleasure?” 

I: ‘I know not what they are.” 

He: “All sexes, all ages, all conditions and sorts, all degrees 


Juliette & 865 


of kinship, all manners of enjoying these various individuals, all 
this, I say, is then a matter of indifference to you?” 

I: “I make no discriminations..” 

He: “But you do nonetheless have preference for certain 
forms of enjoyment?” 

I: “Yes, I am particularly disposed toward the stronger ones, 
those which fools dare call antinatural, criminal, ridiculous, scan- 
dalous, the unlawful, the illegal kind, the antisocial and ferocious 
ones: for those I have a predilection, and they shall always be 
the delight of my life.” 

“Brother,” said Brahe, “take your place amongst us, you 
are received into the Society.” 

And when I had sat down, “In asking now,”’ Brahe went on, 
“whether your wife’s attitudes and principles correspond to your 
own, we refer ourselves only to you.” 

“They do. I swear to it in her behalf,” I replied. 

“Then heed what I am about to tell you,” the Senator began. 

“The Northern Lodge, whose chiefs we are, has a consider- 
able following in Stockholm; but the rank and file Masons know 
nothing of our behavior, our secrets, our customs, they trust our 
leadership and obey our instructions. I have therefore to speak 
to you upon but two matters, Brother: our morals and our inten- 
tions. 

‘These intentions are to overthrow the Swedish throne as well 
as every other throne, everywhere, and principally those occupied 
by the Bourbons. But our Brothers in various parts of the world 
will attend to that; our task is here in our own country. Once 
upon the throne of the kings, there shall never have been a tyranny 
to equal ours, no despot shall ever have put a thicker blindfold 
over the eyes of the people; plunged into essential ignorance, it 
shall be at our mercy, blood will flow in rivers, our Masonic 
Brethren themselves shall become the mere valets of our cruelties, 
and in us alone shall the supreme power be concentrated; all 
freedom shall go by the board, that of the press, that of worship, 
that simply of thought shall be severely forbidden and ruthlessly 
repressed; one must beware of enlightening the people or of lifting 
away its irons when your aim is to rule it. 

“You, Borchamps, shall not be permitted to share in this 


866 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


authority, your foreign origins exclude you therefrom; but you: 
shall be entrusted with the command of the armies and above all 
the robber bands which, very early in the day, shall spread murder 
and rapine across the ler.gth and breadth of Sweden to consolidate 
our hold upon the cour.tryside. When the time comes, will you 
swear faithful allegiance to us?” 

“T swear it in advance.” 

‘‘We may then turn to the question of our morals. 

“Their depravatior, Brother, is appalling; the foremost of 
the moral pledges which bind us, after those political ones I have 
just indicated, is mutually to prostitute our wives, our sisters, our 
mothers and our children one to the other; to enjoy all those 
persons, pell-mell, in the presence of one another and, preferably, 
in the manner that God. as they say, punished at Sodom. Victims 
of both sexes serve in our orgies, and ’tis upon them falls the brunt 
of our desires’ irregulari-y. Is your wife of your own mind touching 
these immoralities, and as determined as you in their execution?” 

“Be certain of it!’ said Emma. 

“That however is not all,” Brahe continued, ‘‘the most 
frightful disorders entertain us, there is no excess before which 
we hesitate. With us, <trocity is often carried to the point of 
stealing, of murdering in the street, of poisoning wells, streams, 
of perpetrating arson, of occasioning famines, of blighting live- 
stock, and of sowing epidemics among men, less perhaps for the 
sake of our amusement tian to weary the population of the present 
government and to cause it ardently to yearn for the revolution 
we are preparing. Do these actions revolt you or are you able 
to participate in the Society’s program without remorse ?”’ 

“The sentiment you refer to there has always been a stranger 
to my heart: the entire universe come to bits in my hands would 
not cost mea tear....” 

Whereupon I receive the fraternal accolade from the entire 
assembly. They then bade me bare my behind, and each of those 
present, men and women alike, came forward to kiss it, suck it, 
and then thrust a muddied tongue into my mouth. Emma was 
exposed up to the waist; her skirts were held up by ribbons pinned 
to her shoulders, and she was subjected to the same homages; but 
lovely though she was, no word was spoken in her praise: the 


Juliette 2 867 


assembly’s regulations prohibited encomiums, I was given fore- 
warning of it. 

“We shall all undress,” said Brahe who presided over the 
meeting, ‘‘we shall then move on into the adjoining room.” 

Ten minutes later we were ungarbed and ready, and we 
flocked into a large chamber lined with Turkish couches, the floor 
strown with cushions and large ottomans. The statue of Jacques 
Molay at the stake adorned the center of the room. 

“You see there,” said Brahe, “the efigy of him we must 
avenge; let us, while awaiting that happy day, swim in the ocean 
of delights he himself was preparing for his Brethren.” 

A mild warmth suffused that agreeable retreat which shaded 
candles mysteriously lighted. There was a sudden swirl and the 
next instant all had come to grips. I leap toward the fetching 
Amelia; her glances had aroused me, and till then all the heat in 
me was due to her; her desires fling her my way before my arms 
can fold around her. I could give you no clear picture of her 
charms: I was too overpowered then to be able to paint them now. 
There was never a mouth so sweet, never an ass so beautiful. 
Amelia bends away, of her own accord offering me the shrine in 
which she knows full well I am wont to do my worship, and I 
soon perceive that, be it from habit, be it from taste, the rascal 
is lending herself more for the sensation than to be obliging, and 
that no other attack would have pleased her nearly so much. The 
desire to embugger the three other women, and their husbands 
also, prevented me from losing my fuck in Amelia’s incomparable 
ass; and I hurled myself upon Steno, then sodomizing Emma. En- 
chanted by this stroke of good fortune, the Senator showed me a 
very brave behind, whereof I nonetheless took early leave in order 
to probe that belonging to Ernestine, his wife, a fair and volup- 
tuous creature over whom I toiled for a long while. Fredegunda 
attracts me, however: Ernestine’s joys had been all daintiness and 
delicacy, but this one’s were all transports and frenzy. Leaving 
her, I flew to her husband. Ericsson, fifty years old, flutters under 
my prick like a dove under her mate, and the lecher answers my 
tooling with such fervor and zeal that he steals away my seed; 
but Brahe, who hails me then, is, by some fervent sucking, soon 
able to restore to my engine all the energy which Ericsson’s fine 


868 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


buttocks have just drained out of it; those Brahe presents to me, 
and whose anus I sound, quickly make me forget the happiness 
of a moment before. I fuck Brahe an uninterrupted half-hour and 
only quit him for Volf who has been sodomizing Ulrika, whose 
delicate ass obtains my sperm before long. What libertinage! what 
foulness of mind and filth of behavior in this Jast-named creature! 
Everything voluptuousress can have of the tartest, everything 
libertinage contains of the wildest was organized and applied by 
this Messalina. Grabbing my prick directly it had discharged, the - 
slut did everything under the sun to revive it and lodge it in her 
cunt; but I proved invincible. Staunch adherent to the Society’s 
laws, I reached the point of threatening Ulrika with denunciation 
if she persisted anothe: instant in her attempts to seduce me; 
furious, the rascal crammed my device back into her ass and flung 
and danced so ardently about that she squirted fuck in every 
direction. 

While I was thus facking every ass in the room, Emma, just 
as bountifully regaled, had not missed a prick; they had all, even 
mine, been in and out of her ass, but not all had discharged there; 
these were libertines of raark whom a single enjoyment, be it of an 
uncommonly fine ass, was not apt to electrify so keenly as to cost 
them their fuck, no, they did not part with it as readily as all that; 
they every one, for exarnple, buggered me, and from not one of 
them did I get sperm. Ericsson, the most licentious of the lot, 
might well have fucked fifteen such ones as he had at his disposal, 
and it is doubtful whether his prick would have purpled. Young 
and vigorous though he was, Brahe, had it not been for the in- 
credible episodes wherecf we shall speak anon, would not have 
brought matters to their conclusion either. As for Steno, his strug- 
gles were over: bewitched by Emma, that voluptuous creature’s 
stunning ass had, so he said, sufficed, and his boiling fuck had 
flooded it. On the other hand, Volf, more refined in his needs, still 
lacking what he required for discharge, had also merely tuned his 
instrument, and it was only at supper, which was shortly announced, 
that I began to glimpse the essential peculiarities of my new 
acolytes’ tastes. This supper was awaiting us in another hall, 
where six fair boys of from fifteen to eighteen and six charming 
girls of the same age were at hand, naked, to serve us. After a 


Juliette % 869 


sumptuous repast further orgies were celebrated and now the whole 
truth about those Swedish despots’ unruly passions finally came out. 

Steno, as we know, had discharged with ease into Emma’s ass; 
he nonetheless desired, for the perfection of his ecstasy, that a 
young boy suck his mouth amorously and simultaneously finger his 
asshole while he himself fucked a man: such was his passion. 

To rescue his honor, Ericsson had first to lash the skin off a 
pair of young persons, one male, the other female: without 
this preliminary he could never get anywhere. 

There was Volf who would have himself embuggered while, 
for a solid hour he plied a cat-o’-nine-tails against the ass in which 
he proposed to discharge. Otherwise, no erection worth speak- 
ing of. 

More mischievous yet, Brahe was not disposed to ejaculate 
until he had maimed a victim hard by the ass he coveted. 

These passions were unfolded between fruit and cheese. 
Wine, hope, ambition, pride went to everyone’s head, all inhibitions 
were forgotten; the women, positively uncontrollable, were the 
first to set examples of the disorderliness which, by the time the 
evening ended, had cost six victims their lives. 

As we were about to take our leave, Steno, in the name of 
the Society expressing his joy at having us in its midst, asked me 
if I were by any chance in need of a sum. ..; I thought it wisest 


to say no, at least for the moment. And for a week I heard nothing © 


more from my new friends. Then, on the morning of the eighth 
day, Steno came to see me. 

‘We are going on a prowl tonight,” said he, “the women shall 
not be along; do you care to join us?” 

‘What have you in mind?” 


‘Some random crimes. We mean to do a little stealing, — 


pillaging, assassinating, burning. In a word, to commit some 
horrors; are you with us?” 

“Surely.” 

“Meet us at eight o’clock at Brahe’s house in the suburbs; 
we leave from there.” 


A delicious supper was awaiting us, and twenty-five troopers, | 
chosen for superiority of member, were, in spending themselves in | 
our asses, to impart to us the energy necessary for the projected 


870 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


expedition. We were fucked forty times apiece, which was more 
than I had ever been before at a single tourney. These preliminaries 
left us all afire, in such a state of agitation that we'd have taken a 
knife to the throat of Almighty God himself had the bugger- 
fucker existed. 

Escorted by ten of the stoutest champions in the band, there 
we are roaming the streets like furies, blindly assaulting everybody 
in our path: as one by one our victims were robbed and killed, 
their bodies were tossed into the canals. If we stopped anything 
worth the bother, we'd rape it first, murder it afterward. We 
broke our way into several humble dwellings, which we devastated 
once we were done terrorizing, mutilating, and finally butchering 
their inhabitants; we permitted ourselves every imaginable and 
every nameless execration, and left screams, flames, and blood in 
our wake. We found the patrol, we attacked it, put it to flight; 
and ’twas only when we were glutted on atrocities that we wended 
our way homeward as ‘he sun rose to shine upon the debris left 
by our scandalous orgies. 

Needless to say, we had it printed in the press that such were 
the frightful abuses the government was perpetrating, and that so 
long as the royal regime prevailed over the Senate and the law, 
no fortune would be in safety, no citizen would walk in peace 
abroad or breathe in peace at home. The people believed what they 
read and sighed for a revolution. Aye, so it is the poor fools are 
hoodwinked, so it is the common population is at once made the 
pretext and the victim of its leaders’ wickedness: always weak and 
always stupid, sometimes it is made to want a king, sometimes a 
republic, and the prosperity its agitators offer under the one 
system or the other is never but the phantom created by their 
interests or by their passions.° 

However, the hour was approaching, such was the desire for 
a change that this was che sole subject of conversations. A more 
discerning and an abler politician than my associates, at the very 
moment they were convincing themselves that success was at hand, 
I saw that the wind lay in the other direction; calmer than they,

happy inhabitants of this globe, there’s the story of you one and all.

I sounded out opinion, and from the immense quantity of people 
I found firmly attached to the king and his royalists I drew the 
conclusion that the senatorial revolution was destined to be still- 
born. It was then that, faithful to the principles of egoism and 
villainy to which I have been devoted all my life, I resolved to 
change camp on the spot, and inhumanly to betray the one into 
which I had been received. Of the two it was the weaker, that was 
obvious; it was neither goodness on the one side nor badness on the 
other that decided me, force was the only deciding factor, and 
it was only with force I wished to keep company. I would have 
unfailingly stayed with the senators had I believed their faction 
not the better (I knew perfectly well that it was the more vicious), 
but the more powerful; the evidence convinced me that it was not: 
I turned traitor. This, it will perhaps be said, was infamous; so 
be it. But infamy meant little to me when my welfare or safety 
lay in treason. Man is born to pursue his happiness on earth, and 
for no other purpose; all the vain considerations opposed thereto, 
all the prejudices which hinder him are better flouted than heeded, 
for it is not the esteem of others that will render him happy; 
he is happy only if he is so in his own opinion, and it will never be 
from laboring toward his prosperity, whatever the road he chooses 
for getting there, that he will be able to lose self-respect. 

I request private audience with Gustavus; I obtain it; I reveal 
everything to him, I name those who have sworn to dethrone him, 
I give him my word not to leave Stockholm until he has investigated 
the conspiracy I allege, and I ask no more than a million by way 
of reward if my warnings prove founded and exact; eternal im- 
prisonment if false. The monarch’s vigilance, aided by my dis- 
closures, averts the catastrophe. On the day the insurrection was 
to break out, Gustavus was up and in the saddle before dawn: 
he sent the people home, isolated the plotters, won over the mili- 
tary, seized the arsenal, and all that without shedding a drop of 
blood. This was not at all what I had been counting upon; gloating 
in advance over the terrible consequences I fancied my treachery 
would have, I too was up with the sun and gone out to see all those 
heads fall: the imbecile Gustavus spared them every one. I was 
aghast. Oh, said I to myself, how I regret having broken faith 
with those who at least would have drenched this kingdom in 


872 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


blood. I have been deceived; they accused this prince of being a 
despot, and look at the clumsy oaf! he is meek as a lamb when I 
give him the means and the occasion to fortify his tyranny! Bah, 
a plague upon the fellow! 

‘“‘Ah, mark my words,” said I to all those who cared to listen 
to me, and they were not many, “your prince is jeopardizing the 
future instead of taking this precious opportunity to plant his 
scepter, as he ought to do, upon a hill of corpses. Brief will be his 
reign, believe me, and unhappy his end.’”* 

I was not however obliged to remind him of his promise; 
Gustavus himself summoned me to his palace and along with my 
fee of a million gave me the order to get out of his States im- 
mediately. 

“I pay traitors,” he said to me, “they are useful, I need them; 
but I despise them and, once they have served their purpose, prefer 
to have them out of my sight.” 

What does it matter to me, said I to myself as I went away, 
whether this clod esteems or detests me; he has money, that is what 
I was after. As for the character he reproaches in me, he'll not 
correct it: I delight in treason and am going to commit a little 
more of it very soon. 

Ten minutes later I fly to Steno. 

“My wife let it out,” I tell him, “she is a monster; I have 
just learned the entire story, she received money for this horror. 
Thanks to her treachery [ have orders to leave Sweden, I shall go, 
for I must. But before I do I'd like to settle my score with her. 
The town is quiet, nothing prevents us from meeting together this 
evening, let us do so; and let us punish the creature, that is all 
I ask of you.” 

Steno consents. I conduct Emma to the Society without her 
knowing for what reason it is gathering; all the men, all the 
women rise in fury agairist her whom I accuse, unanimously con- 
demn her to the most atrocious death. Emma, bewildered at such 
charges, seeks to recriminate against me; she is reduced to silence. 
While lubricious scenes are enacted around the scaffold raised 
for her destruction, the luckless wretch, entrusted to my tender 
mercies, is flayed alive, and one by one I slowly grill each part of

her whence I have removed the skin. Throughout it all I was 
being sucked, and my four friends, each fucking a bardash, were 
whipped by their wives whom young girls were cunt-sucking; never 
in all my days had I discharged so deliciously. The operation over 
with, the company mingled; ‘twas then that Amelia, Volf’s wife, 
accosted me. 

“I like your firmness,” she declared. “It was long ago I 
noticed this woman was not the sort you need; I am more suitable 
for you, Borchamps. But I am going to surprise you: swear to me 
that I too shall someday become your victim. I cannot help it, my 
imagination is what it is: delirious. My husband is too fond of me 
to satisfy it; I can stand no more: since the age of fifteen the 
idea of perishing the victim of libertinage’s cruel passions has been 
gnawing my brain. No, I do not want to die tomorrow, my extrava- 
gance does not go that far. But that is how I want to die, and only 
in that manner. To become, as I expire, the occasion of a crime— 
ah, my head reels at the thought; and in the morning I leave 
Stockholm at your side, if you vow to satisfy me.” 

Deeply stirred by this so uncommon proposition, I protest to 
Amelia that she will have cause to be content with me: arrange- 
ments are made, she slips away to join me before the night is over, 
and at sunrise we set forth from the city together. 


I went out of Stockholm with riches that by now had become 
immense: I had inherited from my wife, I had the King’s million, 
and my new friend handed over to me a further six hundred 
thousand francs, which she had stolen from her husband and 
insisted that I take. 

Saint Petersburg, Amelia and I agreed, was to be our desti- 
nation, and thither we took ourselves. She demanded that we 
marry, I consented; and it being needless, in view of our means, 
that we deny ourselves anything we desired, we rented a splendid 
mansion in the finest quarter of the city. Valets, retinue, equipages, 
choice wines and good meat, we stinted not, and soon the flower 
of society was honored. to obtain entry to my wife’s house. The 
Russians are fond of display, lavishness, luxury; but, in everything 
taking their guidance from us, just as soon as a French lord appears

with some magnificence in their midst, they all rush off to copy him. 
The Empress’ minister came in person to invite me to present 
myself to his sovereign: and knowing I was born for great adven- 
tures, I accepted his propositions. 

Always familiar with those who pleased her, Catherine asked 
me several particular questions about France, and my replies having 
satisfied her, she gave me permission to pay her frequent court. 
Thus did two years pass, during which we, Amelia and I, swam 
in all that noble city could offer in the way of pleasures. A note 
from the Empress finally clarified the reasons lying behind her 
willingness to see me so often. In this missive she besought me to 
accompany the man who delivered it to me: at nightfall he would 
escort me to one of her country residences, situated a few leagues 
outside the town. Amelia, whom I told of this stroke of good luck, 
did all she could to dissuade me, and was much aggrieved to see 
me set forth. 

‘Concerning your person,” the Empress began as soon as 
we were alone together, “I have gathered all the information 
necessary. I know of your behavior in Sweden, and whatever 
others may have said alout it, or thought, I strongly approve it. 
For you may be perfectly certain, my good young Frenchman, 
that it is wiser to stand for kings than against, theirs is the better 
side: those who embrace it and to it remain faithful are never 
sorry. Behind a mask of popularity Gustavus sought to fortify 
despotism’s position on is throne; exposing the conspiracy threaten- 
ing to foil his designs, you served despotism well; I praise you 
therefor. Your age, your mien, what they publish of your wit, 
everything appertaining to you excites my interest; and to your 
fortune I may be able to make solid contributions, if you rally to 
my projects... .” 

“Madame!” said ], truly touched by this woman’s charms, 
superb though forty years old, ‘‘the good fortune of pleasing Your 
Majesty is reward enough for the services she enables one to render 
her, and in advance I swear that her orders shall henceforth be 
the duties cherished of my heart and my heart’s sole delights.” 

Catherine gave me her hand, I kissed it with feeling; a fichu 
slips aside, and the world’s most gorgeous bosom appears before 
my eyes; Catherine, covering it over again, speaks of her thinness, 


Juliette -&» 875 


as if any living man had ever spied anything plumper, more de- 
licious, than what I have just had a glimpse of. When the Empress 
observed that I could not contain my enthusiasm, she soon allowed 
me to convince myself that all her other features matched the 
quality of the sample I had just detected. Eh, my friends, what 
else would you have from me except the truth? I showed prick 
to the Empress before the day was out; and as she found me 
infinitely to her liking I was promptly admitted to the honors of 
the imperial bed. Few women of her day could rival Catherine 
for beauty; fleshly parts and forms are not more richly made nor 
more prettily turned; and when I’d come to know a little of her 
temperament I ceased to wonder at the multitude of my prede- 
cessors. All manners of enjoyment were desired by Catherine, and 
you will of course understand that I refused her none of them: 
her ass especially, the fairest ass I’d seen in my life, caused me no 
end of sweetest comforts and cheer. 

“These little malpractices are very prevalent in Russia,” she 
told me, “and I am careful not to proscribe them; the size of this 
swarming population is responsible for the wealth of the nobility, 
and their power interferes with mine, I must use every means to 
weaken it; this one is of effective value and amuses me too, for 
I like vice and its practitioners; promoting it is among my prin- 
ciples. I could easily prove to any sovereign that he can ill afford 
not to do as I. Borchamps, I am enchanted to see you treating my 
behind with such deference and attention”—I was kissing it even 
as she spoke—‘‘and declare to you that it is at your disposal when- 
ever you are of a mind to fuck it... .” 

I made much use, that evening, of the license granted me. 

It was here the Empress, who was not altogether without 
prudence, drew the line during our first interview, she did not open 
herself farther; the second transpired a week later, and in the 
same way. But at the third Catherine spoke to me in this wise: 
“T now feel confident enough in you to associate you with my plans. 
Before disclosing them, however, I require a sacrifice of you, and I 
want you to subscribe to it this instant. Who isthe pretty Swede 
you have in your train, Borchamps ?”’ 

“She is my wife.” 

“Be that as it may, I do not want to see her alive tomorrow.” 


876 2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“The swelling prick you are holding in your hand, Princess,” 
was my reply, ‘‘is ready to sign her death warrant in your ass. .. .” 

“Good,” said Catherine, lodging my instrument inside her, 
“but I am cruel; this woman has roused my jealousy to a dangerous 
point, and since I wish her to endure sufferings proportional to the 
uneasiness she has caused me, I wish that, while you and I look on, 
she be tonged tomorrow, with heated pincers; every quarter of an 
hour the procedure will be interrupted in order that she be sus- 
pended in this or that raanner and half-broken on the wheel; my 
executioners will fuck her at each stage, I'll have her bathed in 
quicklime before all the life is gone out of her. In the meantime 
I shall be examining your countenance: if you prove steadfast, 
brave, the secret shall be revealed to you. Otherwise, it shall 
not be.” : 

Lovely though Amelia was, two years of enjoying her had 
furiously calmed my desires. In her there were overmuch tender- 
ness, overmuch affection, and a mind far less cruel than at first 
I had supposed. What she had told me about the way in which 
she wanted to end her days, this, the more I pondered it, had 
simply been an effort on her part to be ingratiating; it did not 
correspond to her real feelings. What was more, Amelia was with- 
out all the gracious coridescension I expected in a woman; she 
refused to suck me, and as for her behind, while I do not for a 
moment deny that it had had its very great charms, I would ask 
you, does a woman’s still have any after you've fucked it for two 
years? Everything was therefore promised to Catherine, who was 
greatly entertained by the possibility of satisfying the desire my 
wife had once expressed touching on the death she wished to die: 
the very next day, Amelia was brought to one of the Empress’ 
houses, a very obscure one and far away from the city, and pre- 
sented to Her Majesty. 

There is no imagining the transports of this woman, who was 
accustomed to seeing everything and everyone yield to her will. 
There is no believing the harshness, the tyranny she displayed 
toward the unlucky Swedish girl; she exacted the most debasing 
services from her; had A.melia lick and frig her, submitted her to 
the most trying vexations, and then, surrendering her to her 
executioners, the monster watched her actually undergo every one 


Juliette 3 877 


of the tortures prescribed in the plan she had elaborated. She 
insisted that I embugger the hapless victim during the intervals; 
such was her delirium, she demanded that I fuck the executioners 
even as they were at work torturing Amelia; and pleased to see 
my prick keep at an even stand the whole while, of my character 
she formed the opinion that answered to her desires. My poor 
bedraggled wife expired after eleven hours of varied and violent 
agonies. Catherine discharged twenty times at least; she herself 
lent the executioners a hand; and she said that a week hence, she 
would unfold her grand scheme to me, and I was dismissed.’ 

Hitherto I had been the Empress’ guest at her country 
establishments only; this time it was into the Winter Palace I had 
the honor to be admitted. 

“From what I have observed of you, Borchamps,” Catherine 
declared to me, “I can be in no doubt about the energy of your 
character. No longer under the influence of childhood prejudices 
toward what fools call crime, the attitude you exhibit is plain and © 
enlightened; but if this mode of action is frequently useful to | 
ordinary folk, how often it becomes indispensable to rulers and 
to statesmen! The private individual, laying sturdy foundations | 
for his worldly well-being, has seldom to go beyond one or two | 
crimes in the course of his existence; those persons who oppose his _ 
desires are in number so few that to combat them he needs little | 
in the way of arms. But we, Borchamps, perpetually surrounded | 
by flatterers seeking only to deceive us, or by powerful enemies 
whose unique aim is to destroy us, how many are the different 
circumstances under which we are obliged to employ crime! A 
sovereign who is jealous of his prerogatives ought never to go to | 
sleep without his mace under his pillow. 

“The famous Peter fancied he was performing a great service 
for Russia when he struck off the chains of a people who had never | 
known nor cherished anything but its bondage; but Peter, more 
mindful of his reputation than of the lot of those who were to | 
follow him on his throne, did not realize he was tarnishing mon- | 
archy’s diadem without making the people happier. And what in 


7 Those who have had a close view of this woman, famous as much for her wit | 
as for her misdeeds, will here recognize her sufficiently well to agree that this 
portrait of Catherine could only have been painted from nature.

fact did this great change he instituted gain him? He increased 
the territories of Russia; but what could the greater or lesser 
extent of his dominions matter to him, who lived only upon a few 
acres of it? Why, at great expense, import arts and sciences from 
abroad and plant them in a native soil where he wished to see 
corn grow ? What pleased him in the semblance of a freedom which 
only added to the weight of his subjects’ shackles? It may be un- 
hesitatingly afirmed: Peter was as certainly the downfall of Russia 
as will be her liberator he who reimposes the yoke upon her: en- 
lightened Russia perceives what she lacks, Russia restored to 
slavery would see nothng beyond her physical needs. Now, in 
which of the two situations is man more fortunate: in the one 
where, the blindfold removed from his eyes, he is able to discern 
all his privations? or in the other, where his ignorance prevents 
him from suspecting any of them? These bases once established, 
does one deny that the most violent despotism better befits the 
subject than the fullest independence? And if you grant me this 
point—which I think it impossible to contest—do you blame me 
for resorting to every conceivable device in order to arrange affairs 
in Russia as they were before the baneful advent of Peter? 
“Basilovitch reigned as I mean to reign; his tyranny is the 
model I propose to adoot. He used to amuse himself, they say, 
dashing out his captives’ brains, raping their wives and daughters, 
mutilating them with his own hands, rending them into pieces, and. 
after that burning them; he assassinated his son; at Novgorod he 
punished an insurrection by having three thousand human beings 
thrown into the Volga; he was the Nero of Russia. Well, I shall 
be her Theodora or her Messalina; whatever the horror that en- 
ables me to strengthen my hold on the throne, I shall not falter, 
and the first of those I must consummate is the killing of my son. 
You, Borchamps, are the man J have in mind to accomplish this 
political atrocity. He arnong my compatriots whom I were to 
select for the task migh: have a sentimental attachment to this 
prince, and instead of an accomplice I would be engaging my be- 
trayer; only too well I recall the legitimate grievances I had of the 
Russian to whom I entrusted the slaying of my husband; I want 
no more such unpleasant experiences. Nothing necessitates that it 


Juliette = 879 


be one of my countrymen whom I charge with these great commis- 
sions; a remnant of the loyalty he imagines due one of his nation’s 
princes could deter him, and crime is always bungled when preju- 
dices are operative. With you I have no such fears; I have here 
the poison I want you to employ. . . . I have spoken, Borchamps; 
how do you decide ?” 

“Madame,” I replied to this woman whose greatness of char- 
acter has been admitted universally, “even had I lost the taste for 
crime I was born with, even had crime ceased to be my element and 
very sustenance, this one that you propose would flatter me, and the 
mere idea of ridding the world of a meek and debonair prince in 
order to preserve there the tyranny whereof nobody is a more 
zealous partisan than I, this idea, Madame, would alone suffice to 
cause me to undertake, joyfully, the project you outline to me: 
count upon my obedience.” : 

“This profound resignation makes you mine forever,” said 
Catherine, folding me in her arms. “I intend, tomorrow, to treat 
you to an orgy of delights, to make all your senses boil. I want you 
to behold me in pleasure’s throes; and I want to behold you in 
them; and when we are both very merry and very high from lewd 
sights and lewd doings, you shall be given the venom that is to put 
an end to the abhorrent existence of that contemptible creature I 
failed to avoid bringing into this world.” 

The rendezvous was at the country house where I had seen 
the Empress previously. She was awaiting me in a magical boudoir, 
a veritable garden where, in the warm air, exotic flowers were 
blooming in mahogany benches agreeably scattered throughout 
this exquisite chamber. Turkish sofas, surrounded by mirrors and 
beneath mirrors affixed to the ceiling, cried to be put to voluptuous 
use. From there a more lugubrious alcove was visible; in it was to 
be seen a quartet of twenty-year-old youths. They were in irons, 
helpless, held at the mercy of Catherine’s unbridled passions. 

‘“‘What you are looking at in there,” the Empress said to me, 
‘fs the climax to the entertainment. A preliminary series of ordi- 
nary pleasures will fettle us gradually; we shall not come to grips 
with those boys until our fever has attained its final pitch. Would 
victims of my sex please you better ?” 


880 + THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Why, tis a matter of indifference to me,” I assured her; “I 
will share your pleasures, and whatever the individual upon whom 
murder is committed, it is always certain to stimulate my senses.” 

“Ah, Borchamps, nothing else in the world is worth the 
candle! It is so sweet to behave unnaturally—” 

“But what is more natural than murder ?”’ 

“T know; but it constitutes an infraction of the law, and I 
adore the idea.” 

‘*The law? What can she care for the law who makes the law? 
Tell me: has Your Highness already enjoyed these four fine young 
men?” 

“Would they be in my chains otherwise ?” 

‘Do they realize what fate lies in store for them?” 

‘“‘Not yet; we shall announce it while utilizing them. I shall 
pronounce the sentence of each while your prick is in his ass.” 

“IT would also like :hat to be the moment when you carry it 
out.” 

“Ah, you're a villain, an adorable villain!’ Catherine ex- 
claimed. 

And the lust-objects appointed for the impending games ap- 
peared forthwith. They were six lasses of fifteen or sixteen years, 
of rarest beauty; and six men, each five feet ten inches tall, all with 
members as thick as your forearm and at least as long. 

“Install yourself there where you have a clear view of me,” 
Catherine instructed me, ‘‘and consider my pleasures, keeping your 
distance; frig yourself if you like, but do not disturb me. I am 
going to taste the supreme delights of offering you a display of 
thorough whorishness; cynicism is part of my character, I like to 
make a discreditable parade of myself, scandal excites my mind.” 

I do as I am told. The girls undress their queen, then shower 
her with the prettiest caresses. Three of them suck, one her mouth, 
another her cunt, the last her asshole; they are #eplaced at their 
posts by the other three; “he first team relieves the second; and the 
exercise was conducted at a very smart pace; they picked up withes 
and bestowed a gentle scourging upon Catherine, each toiling over 
a different part of her body. The men stepped forward and while 
they were at work, this or that girl would now and again approach 


Juliette > 881 


to kiss mouths and stroke members. When the Tsarina’s body was 
all a bright scarlet she had herself rubbed with spirits; then, sitting 
on the face of one of the little maids, who was ordered to tongue 
her vent, she received a second, kneeling, between her thighs, who 
sucked her clitoris; the third sucked her mouth; the fourth, her 
teats; and she frigged the remaining two, one with either hand. 
The six lads, now grouping themselves likewise, put prickpoint to 


everything of the six girls’ behinds they could reach. No, I had | 
never beheld anything so voluptuous as this exquisite ensemble; its | 
maneuvers cost Catherine a discharge. I heard her moan and utter 


blasphemies in Russian, it was her custom. 


Another scene was enacted immediately. It was she who now | 
frigged the girls, each in her turn; but she sucked only their funda- | 
ments; and while she was sucking them, the men were tickling hers. | 
This calling for the participation of only two subjects, the ten — 
others did before her eyes what she herself was doing. After a — 
little everything changes again. Now she stuffs a prick into her cunt _ 
and, lying atop him who is fucking her so, she offers her ass to | 
another who sodomizes her mightily; to left and to right she chafes _ 
a prick upon a girl’s buttocks; he who embuggers her is flogged, 


and all the rest cluster around her, in suggestive attitudes. Thus 


did the six men fray her cuntwise and asswardly; after which, she 


served the six girls up for fucking, all by herself she fitted pricks 


into avenues of pleasure, sucked each engine as it emerged from | 
this breach or that, meanwhile herself titillating the clitoris and 
kissing the mouth of the girl; she sprawls upon the sofa and has | 


herself mounted by the men, one after another: each, raising her 
thighs, was to tup her in front and behind; as this was going for- 


ward, each of the girls had to squat above her brow, kiss the man 
serving her, and then piss on her face. During this scene the rascal | 
shed another great quantity of fuck. It was at its conclusion that | 


she summoned me. I was at the end of my tether, Tantalus’ suf- 


ferings were as nothing next to mine, and to see me thus was what 


the whore had wanted. 
“Are you stiff?” she inquired ironically. 
“Have a look at it, slut!’ I stormed. 
That insolent reply pleased her beyond words. 


882 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Why then,” she went on, turning around, “my ass is at your 
disposal. It’s full of fuck, you can deposit yours in there along 
with the rest.” 

And the saucy creature sucked one of her men’s asses while 
I sodomized her. Ass after ass was presented to her lips; I handled 
the asses of the girls while I fucked away, and despite all I could 
do, my seed escaped me. She forbade me to leave her ass, then 
commanded the men to fuck me back into fucking form; her orders 
to the girls were to giv me their buttocks for kissing, and their 
cunts to her for tonguing; so it was that three times in succession 
my fuck flowed. 

“‘Let’s perform some cruelties now,” Catherine proposed; “I 
am spent, I must resort to severities.” 

Each man then got down on all fours, a girl got astride him, 
so that each couple offeed a pair of vulnerable asses. Catherine 
armed herself with a whip of the kind executioners use in Russia 
for administering the knout,® and with her royal hand the trollop 
lashed all those fair behinds so thoroughly that blood lay in puddles 
on the floor; I was whipping her at the same time, but simply with 
birch rods, and after every twenty cuts I had to kneel behind her 
and lick her anus. 

“Tam going,” she told me, “to martyrize all these individuals, 
but in a rather more serious manner; once I have had my pleasure 
from them I propose to put them to no very pretty death... .” 

The men seize the g rls, spread their legs wide apart and hold 
them thus; Catherine sends whistling blows of her whip into the 
poor souls’ gaping vaginis, from which she fetches forth streams 
of blood. Next, the girls lay hold of the men and Catherine plies 
her scourge upon their pricks and balls. 

‘What concern can any of that be to me now?” she was ask- 
ing. ““Drained and limp, :t’s worthless, there’s nothing to be done 
with such tripe but feed it to worms; frolic with these individuals, 


8 This whip is fashioned from a bull’s pizzle; to it are attached three thongs of 
moose hide. A single stroke draws blood: these instruments are of incomparable 
utility to those who cherish, either actively or passively, the pleasures of flagellation. 
To increase their effectiveness, steel tips may be fitted to the thongs; it then becomes 
possible to remove flesh virtually without effort; one hundred strokes applied by a 
vigorous arm will kill anyone. One such whip, more or less studded, is in the pos- 
session of every voluptuous Russian.

Borchamps, they're yours and I'll take my turn watching you.” 

Directed and encouraged by me, the girls bring the men’s 
members aloft again and I am fucked another two times by each 
of them; I push my prick into all those dozen fundaments, I ar- 
range various tableaux, and Catherine masturbates while observ- 
ing me. 

“That will do,” says she, “let us move on to more important 
matters.” 

The victims entered; but what was my astonishment at seeing 
one of those young men so closely resemble the Empress’ son that 
for a moment I could believe it was the Tsarevitch himself. 

“I should hope,” Catherine said to me upon noticing my sur- 
prise, “that you are able to read my intentions.” 

“Gauging your mind by the standard of my own,” was my 
answer, “I take it that this is the person upon whom we are going 
to test the poison you have selected for the young man who could 
easily be his twin.” 

“Exactly,” Catherine admitted; “I shall be deprived of the 
pleasure of witnessing my son’s agonies, this fellow’s will give me 
an image of them. My illusion will be agreeable; I'll discharge you 
perfect floods.” 

“Delicious mind,” I cried, “what a pity you are not the whole 
earth’s queen, and I your prime minister !” 

“‘Assuredly,” said the Empress, “we'd achieve a great many 
wicked things together, and it would be a planet inhabited by our 
victims... .” 

Before anything else Catherine had herself fucked by those 
four ill-starred young men while I embuggered them and the dozen 
other subjects were either flogging or frigging us, or adopting ob- 
scene poses. 

“The first six men with whom we began our fucking,” the 
Empress told me, “are my ordinary executioners; you shall see 
them in action upon that pretty quartet. As for these women, does 
your lubricity doom any of them? If so, point them out now and I 
shall dismiss the rest so that we can quietly amuse ourselves con- 
templating the destruction of these unfortunates.” 

Two of those charming creatures having made a strong im- 
pression upon me, I designated them for death, and then only four- 


884 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


teen of us remained: six executioners, a like number of victims, the 
Tsarina and I. 

The living image of Catherine’s son was the first victim to 
appear on the stage. I myself presented him the fatal drink whose 
effects were not felt until half an hour later; by then we had both, 
and in every manner, enjoyed him fairly to shreds; when we were 
done, his pains began, and they were terrifying. Ten minutes after 
his first convulsions the wretch expired, before our avid gazes; and 
during the spectacle, Catherine had herself embuggered uninter- 
ruptedly. Then she had each of the other young men one after the 
other bound fast atop her body: she pecked at them, she frigged 
them, while the executioners, into whose ranks the whore had in- 
corporated me, hacked and slashed those knaves to mincemeat as 
they squirmed and thrashed upon her; the torments we subjected 
them to were beyond namber and example. The two girls I had 
asked leave to execute ty myself perished under treatment just as 
rigorous as that which :he men had undergone, and I dare say I 
may even have improved upon the horrors the Empress had or- 
dered. I opened the cunt of one of them and stuck fifty or sixty 
minikins into the walls of her vagina; then I fucked her. Each 
thrust of my prick, driving those tiny pins in to the head, wrung 
piercing shrieks from the unhappy creature, and Catherine avowed 
she had never invented anything so delightful. 

The corpses were removed, and Catherine and I sat down to 
a private supper; we were both naked. She waxed very passionate, 
bestowed unstinting praise upon my rigidity of prick and principle, 
and for me foresaw the most brilliant future at her Court once I 
had brought about her son’s death. The poison was entrusted to 
me, I promised to take action on the morrow. Twice again did I 
fuck Catherine the Great in the ass, and we parted. 

For quite some time I had been the young prince’s familiar; 
Catherine had, on purpose, encouraged those frequentations; she 
had even wanted me to frig myself in that young man’s company, 
in order to excite her lewdness by the details I would give her con- 
cerning the person of this child her rage doomed. The téte-a-téte 
had taken place; on another occasion Catherine, in hiding, had even 
watched us indulge in a bout of buggery. This liaison favored the 


Juliette & 885 


carrying out of our plan. The Tsarevitch, as was his wont, came 
one morning to take breakfast with me, and it was then the blow © 
was struck. But from long exposure to his mother’s attempts on his 
life, the young prince had made a rule of never eating anything 
in town without swallowing some antidote as soon as he felt the 
faintest signs of an indisposition. Thus, our perfidious scheme 
came to nought; and the unjust Catherine, immediately suspecting 
me of having lost my nerve, greeted me with invectives and had 
me arrested as I left her palace. You know that Siberia is the fate 
of all this cruel woman’s state prisoners; my holdings were confis- 
cated, my personal effects seized, I was led off to that horrible place 
of exile; there, like the others, I had to turn over a dozen animal 
skins to the commander every month, and when I failed to do so, 
was flogged to ribbons. Siberia was the grim school where I con- 
verted this punishment into a kind of need which has become so 
violent in me that, for my health’s sake, I absolutely cannot forego 
having myself whipped once a day.® 

Upon arriving in those remote parts I was given a hut whose 
former occupant had just died after fifteen years of detention. It 
was divided into three rooms; light entered them through windows 
of oiled paper. It was built of pine, the only floor was a deep layer 
of old fishbones, which shone like ivory. The roof was covered over, 
rather picturesquely, by the foliage of the trees growing around. 
For security against the incursions of wild animals the place was 
surrounded by a ditch and a palisade of thick stakes reinforced by 
horizontal planks; the upper ends of those stakes were sharpened 
to a point, so that one was protected as though by a fence of spears, 
and when the outer gate was shut one was quite as safe as in a 
little fortress. Inspecting the hut I came upon the former tenant’s 
larder: it contained dry biscuits, salted reindeer flesh, some earthen- 
ware jugs of ale; that was all. Such was the joyless abode to which, 
after my day of hunting, I would return, to weep over the injustice 


®8This habit is so compelling that its addicts are unable to do without whipping, 
and were they to deprive themselves of it, it well might be to their peril. Just prior 
to those moments when they customarily repeat the ceremony, they are subject to 
itchings so extreme that sound thrashing constitutes their sole hope of relief. See 
Abbé Boileau’s history of the Flagellants; and the excellent translation Mercier 
de Compiégne has given us of Meibomius. 


886 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of monarchs and the brutal unkindness of fortune. Nearly ten 
years did I spend in this cruel retirement, having no company save 
that of a few other luckless souls in the same plight as I. 

One of them, Hungarian by birth, an utterly unprincipled man 
and who was called Tergowitz, appeared to be the only person 
there with whom I had anything in common. He at least had a 
rational approach to crime; the others committed it like the ani- 
mals they tracked in the awful Siberian forest. Tergowitz alone, 
instead of soliciting the compassion of God, generally thought to 
be the cause of our woes, confined himself to cursing the deity 
every day; although he was guilty of every crime under the sun, 
his iron soul afforded no room to regrets, and if he was sorry about 
artything, it was to be obliged, owing to the circumstances we were 
in, to neglect his penchants. Like myself, Tergowitz was nearing 
thirty; his face was agreeable, and the first thing our exchange of 
confidences led to was an evening of embuggering each other. 

“(Mark you,” explained the Hungarian as soon as we were 
finished, ‘‘it’s not the absence or need of women that drives me to 
what I have just done, but simply taste. I idolize men and abhor 
females; even if we hac three million of them here, I’d not touch 
a one.” 

“Tell me,” I asked my comrade, “‘is there anyone else in this 
miserable region whom we might associate in our sodomite pleas- 
ures ?”” 

“Yes,” said Tergawitz; “not far from here dwells a Pole 
named Voldomir, fifty-s x years old, as handsome a man as there’s 
anywhere to be found . . . and as fanatic a bugger; he has been in 
these wastelands for eighteen years; he is passionately fond of me 
and, I’m sure, will be most willing to become acquainted with you. 
Borchamps, let’s the three of us join forces and get ourselves out 
of this melancholy part of the world.” 

That same day we went to find the Pole. He lived fifty versts”® 
away: someone that distance from you is your neighbor in Siberia. 
Voldomir, exiled for horrible crimes committed in Russia, struck 
me as a very attractive person indeed, but of remarkable ferocity ; 
his manner of address was gruff, flintlike, and misanthropy seemed 


10 Fifty versts make about thirty-five miles. 


Juliette <a 887 


grained in his every feature. It was not until after Tergowitz had 
given him one or two cogent details-upon my character that he en- 
visaged me with a less hostile eye. As soon as we had supped, we 
all three reached mechanically into our breeches. Voldomir had a 
superb member, but the leatheriest ass I had beheld in all my life. 

‘He never brings in any skins,” Tergowitz explained to me, 
“that assures him of his daily beating.” 

“Very certain it is,” declared the Pole, “that a lashing affords 
me greater pleasure than anything else in the world, and if you’d 
like to practice your arm on them, I'll lend you my buttocks.” 

Wielding the switches he provided us, Tergowitz and I were 
an entire hour thrashing the Pole, who for all we could do seemed 
hardly to feel a thing. At length, however, electrified by the cere- 
mony, the rake caught hold of my behind and into it thrust his 
colossal and unmoistened prick, I was fucked in a trice; Tergowitz 
bum-tupped him the while; and despite the excessively cold weather, 
we left the smoky hut and ass-fucked each other in the snow. That 
prodigious engine caused one a good deal of pain, and the scoundrel 
watched me suffer with an unpitying smile. Snatching his stave out 
of my ass, he buried it in Tergowitz’s, and for nearly two hours 
scraped and tore us both, without discharging; I would embugger 
him while he was fucking my comrade. But, younger than he, less 
jaded, I discharged inside his bowels. 

The Pole had still not loosed his seed when at last he put 
his member away. “Unfortunately,” he said, “I am obliged to deny 
myself these pleasures, or indulge in them alone, for I am utterly 
incapable of bringing them to their proper conclusion without shed- 
ding blood, a great quantity of blood; for lack of men to kill, I 
slaughter animals and smear myself with their gore. But when the 
passions are keen, it is a great hardship to be reduced to these 
makeshifts. . . .” 

“Ah,”. said Tergowitz, ‘‘avowing our tastes to our new com- 
rade, I believe we can inform him that we have not always con- 
fined ourselves to foxes, bears, wolves... .” 

“But where the devil can you find victims?” I demanded of 
my friends. 

‘Among our fellow prisoners.” 


888 <2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Notwithstanding the fact they share your hard lot? You 
have no mercy upon them who, like you, have been treated un- 
mercifully ?”” 

“What do you call mercy?” the Pole asked me. ‘‘That senti- 
ment, chilling to the desires, can it find entry into a stern heart? 
And when a crime delights me, can I be stopped by mercifulness, 
the dullest, most stupid, most futile of all the soul’s impulsions? 
Never has my soul been susceptible of any such feeling, believe me 
when I tell you so, and that my contempt is boundless for the man 
who is such a fool as to conceive it for an instant. The urge, the 
need to shed blood, the most imperious of all needs and urges, 
brooks no interference whatever; he who speaks to you now slew 
his father, his mother, his wife, his children, and repents not, no, 
nor has ever felt a twinge of remorse. With a little courage and 
untrammeled by prejudices, a man can do what he likes with his 
heart and his conscience. Habit adjusts us to anything, and nothing 
is easier than to develop the habit which pleases best: merely sur- 
mount the initial revulsions, if you have any fire in you, you'll suc- 
ceed. Prick in hand, accustom yourself awhile to the idea that 
frightens you, you'll soon come to cherish it: that’s the method I 
have followed to familiarize myself with all known crimes: I 
yearned to commit them, but they scared me; fixing my mind upon 
them, I’d masturbate, and I perform them today as effortlessly as 
I blow my nose. The erroneous notion we entertain of others is 
always the thing that impedes us in criminal affairs, our childhood 
training leads us, ridiculously, to consider our own selves of no 
account and others as all-important. Whence it proceeds that any 
iniquity wrought against this respected fellow being appears a great 
evil to us, although harming one’s neighbor is natural, and Nature’s 
laws are never so well complied with as when we prefer ourselves 
to others and seek pleasure in tormenting them. If it be true that 
we resemble all other products of Nature, if it be true we are 
worth no more than they, why persist in believing ourselves gov- 
erned by different laws? Are plants and animals acquainted with 
mercy, pity, social obligations, brotherly love? And in Nature do 
we detect any law other than self-interest, that is, self-preservation? 
The one great trouble is that human laws are the fruits of nothing 
but ignorance or prejudice; the men who framed them consulted 


Juliette = 889 


their stupidity alone, were guided by their mean-spiritedness, their 
narrow interests, and their myopia. A nation’s lawmaker must 
never be born on its soil; otherwise he will simply transmit to his 
people legalized versions of the infantile nonsense he learned in 
their midst, and his institutions, lacking the force of greatness they 
ought to have, will never inspire awe; for how can you ask that 
men have respect for laws which contradict those Nature engraves 
in them ?”’ 

“Ah, my friend,” said I, carried away by enthusiasm at finding, 
his sentiments so similar to my own, and embracing this charming 
personage, “the theses you have just expounded conform to opin- 
ions which have long been mine, and in me you see someone possess- 
ing a soul at least as stoutly armored as yours.” 

“T am not quite as advanced as you,” the Hungarian said to 
us, “I have never assassinated anybody apart from my sister, my 
niece, and a few comrades hereabouts, in collaboration with Voldo- 
mir; but I have itching fingers and most content I’d be were the 
occasion for a crime to offer itself to me every day of my life.” 

“Friends,” said I, “people united through so many similarities 
of disposition and outlook ought never separate, and when they 
have the misfortune of being prisoners together they should join 
forces to break out of the bondage to which human injustice has 
reduced them.” 

“Our comrade’s views are mine, I am with him,” Voldomir 
declared. 

“So am I,” said Tergowitz. 

‘Very well then,” I resumed, “‘let’s be up and away for the 
. frontier of this infamous clime. Though bayonets guard it, let us 
try to slip across the line: once we are free, the lives and riches of 
others will amply compensate us for the losses occasioned us by 
the perfidious cruelty of the imperial whore who keeps us captive 
here.” 

We drank a few bottles of vodka to our projects, and were 
about to seal our vows with the solemnities of some sodomite 
fuckshed when a lad of fifteen appeared at the door. He came with 
a request from his father, who wished to borrow a few skins from 
Voldomir and who would return them in a day or two. 

“Who is this child?” I asked my friends. 


890 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“The son of a great Russian nobleman,” Voldomir replied, 
“like us exiled for having displeased Catherine; he dwells a hun- 
dred versts from here.’’ Then, taking me aside, he continued in a 
lower voice: ‘‘Since we are soon to leave, and shall be far away 
before his father hears about the thing, we might, if you like, 
amuse ourselves with the boy... .” 

“Yes, by God,” I replied, already laying heavy hands upon 
our young visitor and jerking his breeches down to his knees, “we'll 
fuck him first, then eat 1im afterward: this is tastier flesh than the 
martens and weasels that make up our daily fare.” 

I embugger first while my comrades hold the child still: Tergo- 
witz’s turn comes next; Voldomir because of his massiveness of 
member goes in last; we begin again. And when we have had 
enough of our Hittle darling, we roast him alive on the spit and 
eat him with relish. 

‘Oh, how mistakea they are,” the Hungarian observed, 
disdain this meat, there’s nothing more delicate nor better flavored 
in all the world, as the wise savages understand who have such a 
predilection for it.” 

“That,” said Voldomir, ‘is simply another of your European 
absurdities: after having erected murder into a crime you cut off 
your nose to spite your face and banished these dainties from your 
table; and the same ove:-weening pride brought you to suppose that 
there was no wrong in )utchering a pig for food, while there was 
nothing worse than per‘orming the same operation upon a human 
being. Such are the sinister effects of this civilization I abhor and 
which causes me to regard this degenerated portion of mankind as 
a race of contemptible fools.” 

Our excellent repast concluded, we all three climbed into the 
Pole’s bed and, at sunrise, armed to the teeth, we set off with the 
firm resolve to follow no calling other than that of brigand and 
murderer, to heed nothing except our pleasures and self-interest. 

Unsure of the road we were to take, our first plan was to 
make for the Chinese border since we wished to avoid Muscovy 
and all the other adjoining provinces over which the Empress ruled, 
where we were almost certain to be arrested. But the way to China 
was far, and instead we chose to cross the deserts to the Caspian

shore; after several months of travel we came to Astrakhan, with- 
out anyone having sought to hinder our flight. 

From Astrakhan we moved toward Tiflis, killing, pillaging, 
fucking, ravaging all that crossed our path, and entered this second 
city after laying waste a fair part of the countryside. In us none 
the less was the desire, grown powerful after years spent in the 
wilderness, for a civil and quiet place to abide, where less tumul- 
tuous passions can at once be satisfied more luxuriously, more agree- 
ably, and more conveniently. In this regard, the libertinage, the 
beauty, of the Georgians looked to promise us all we could ask for. 

Tiflis lies at the foot of a mountain on the banks of the River 
Kur, which traverses Georgia; it contains some rather handsome 
palaces. Having robbed a sufficient number of travelers along the 
way to have accumulated two or three thousand rubles apiece, we 
immediately took sumptuous lodgings. We bought pretty serving 
girls; but the Pole, who refused to have anything female even come 
near him, chose a strapping Georgian escorted by two young Greek 
slaves, and we refreshed ourselves a little after the rigors of the 
long and monotonous journey we had just completed. Commerce at 
Tiflis is chiefly in women. There they are publicly sold for the 
harems of Asia and Constantinople, like cattle in a market; any- 
one has the right to go and examine and handle them in the sheds 
where specimens ranging from lately weaned infants up to girls the 
age of sixteen are kept on exhibit. Nowhere will you find greater 
beauty than in the creatures this country produces, nowhere will you 
find more elegant figures, more attractive features. But if one can- 
not look upon them without desiring them, seldom does one desire 
them without having them. Nowhere is whoredom so well estab- 
lished in the world as here. 

Independence is unknown to the Georgians. The tyranny 
their overlords exert upon them is not mild; and as this aristocracy 
is exceedingly libertine, there is no need for me to insist upon the 
fact that in this part of the world too, despotism expresses itself in 
lewd terms: they vex their slaves, beat them, whip them, and all 
that in the spirit of cruel lubricity, whose effects, as you are so fully 
aware, lead to crimes of all sorts. But what a contradiction! These 
nobles, who treat their vassals as slaves, themselves grovel before 


892 ef THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the prince to obtain money and place; and to ensure success, to 
him they prostitute their children of either sex and starting at the 
tenderest age. 

Tergowitz, natura!ly adroit and seductive, soon contrived to 
introduce himself and then to lodge the three of us in the house of 
one of the foremost lords of the land who, along with very con- 
siderable wealth, owned three daughters and as many sons, all of 
the most excellent beauty. As this gentleman had traveled widely, 
Tergowitz affirmed that he had seen him in Russia, in Sweden, in 
Denmark, and the worthy fellow believed it all. It had been a 
long time since we had been shown such courtesy and such generous 
treatment, and doubtless still longer since a benefactor had found 
himself rewarded quite as we paid that one back. We began by a 
general assault upon his children: inside a fortnight, all of them, 
boys and girls alike, had been fucked in every manner. Pointing 
out to us that there was nothing left to fuck under the good man’s 
roof, Voldomir asked how we were going to take our leave. “By 
robbing him,” I replied. “I cannot believe his gold is less worth 
having than the cunts and assholes of his offspring.” 

‘“‘And when we've robbed him?” Tergowitz wondered. 

“Why,” said I, “we shall kill him. There are only a few 
domestics in the house; we are strong enough to take them per- 
sonally in hand, and I feel my prick already twittering at the 
prospect of murdering his pretty children.” 

“But hospitality, my friends, have we not been given hospital- 
ity?” said Voldomir. 

“Indeed we have,” I admitted, ‘‘and therefor we should be 
grateful. Just behavior on our part demands that we do well by 
someone who has acted kindly toward us. Has not this animal our 
host told us a hundred times over that as a good Christian™ he is 
certain he will go straigh: to heaven? His hypothesis accepted, will 
he not be a thousand times happier there than on earth?” 

‘‘Assuredly.” 

“Then we must render him this supreme service.” 

“To be sure,” said Voldomir, “but you have my consent to all 
these deaths only if it is understood that they be frightful. For too 


11 At Tiflis the Christians outnumber the Muslims, there are more churches than 
mosques.

long have our stealing and killing been done out of need; the 
moment has come to steal and kill from wickedness, from taste; 
the world must shudder upon learning of the crime we have 
committed. ... Men must be made to blush from shame at belong- 
ing to the same species as we. More, I insist that a monument be 
raised to this crime, relating it and reminding others of it forever, — 
and that with our own hands we cut our names upon this granite 
memorial.” 
“Go on, villain, you have our sympathy, speak your mind.” 
“He himself must be made to roast his children, to join us in — 
dining on them; and while he feeds he must be embuggered by us; | 
after which, the remnants of the feast must be sewn to his body; — 
bound and helpless in his cellar, he must be left thus to die when 
he feels ready.” 
The scheme is adopted unanimously; unfortunately, however, | 
owing to thoughtlessness on our part the discussion was overheard | 
by the youngest of the man’s daughters, upon whom we had al- | 
ready vented our desires and who was lame from the prodigious 
abuse she had sustained. Voldomir, with his gigantic prick, had left 
her anus a shambles, and to calm her we had been giving her little 
presents for several days. Quaking with terror at what she had just | 
found out, there was no preventing her from rushing off and letting | 
the cat out of the bag. Hearing the slut’s story, the father promptly 
brought a garrison into the house, the police instructing these men © 
to keep an eye on us. But the god who protects crime always leads — 
virtue into its power; of this there ceased long ago to be a shadow 
of a doubt. 
The four soldiers the gentleman led home, and whom he. 
meant to billet in his house without explaining to us his reasons — 
for doing so, were immediately recognized by us as former com-— 
rades who had also managed to escape from Siberia; they, as you. 
may easily imagine, preferred our cause to the Georgian Chris- 
tian’s, and the poor man, instead of three enemies under his roof, 
shortly had seven. The proposal to share in the booty and in the , 
enjoyment of all those children was so warmly welcomed by our. 
reinforcements that we fell to work at once. We tied our benefactor | 
to a pillar in his dining hall and forthwith regaled him first with’ 
five hundred whipstrokes applied to every square inch of his behind, |

then to the pleasure of seeing his six darlings fucked before his 
eyes. Once they had been, we attached them in a circle around him 
and flogged those six asses until the room was awash with their 
blood; next, we lay them upon their backs in the gore and, hoisting 
their legs into the air, we flailed them with martinets and trans- 
formed their anterior parts into hash. After that, we tried to 
induce the father to tzste a little pleasure with his woebegone 
children, but all efforts to rouse his prick were in vain, and so we 
castrated and unmembered him and constrained his progeny to eat 
his testicles and his pizzle; this accomplished, we sliced off the 
breasts of his daughters and now fed him forcibly upon the still 
warm and quivering fles he had himself created. 

We were about to move on to the next exercise when discord 
loomed up in our midst Among the four soldiers was a splendid 
young Russian whose beauty was causing Voldomir to stiffen almost 
as hard as I. I would not, I could not take it upon myself to quit 
the young man’s breeches, from which the Pole, now very dark of 
brow, had several times sought to evict me. When at last I was 
lodged in the youth's asshole, out of the corner of my eye I spied 
Voldomir coming up to me, dagger in hand; I unsheathed my own 
knife that instant and without stirring from the soldier’s funda- 
ment, where I was ready ng to deposit my seed, I stabbed my blade 
into Voldomir’s left side, he fell to the floor, blood gushing from 
the wound. 

“Fuck!” exclaimed Tergowitz, then sodomizing one of the 
other soldiers, “‘there’s « vigorous deed for you. I must tell you, 
Borchamps, that I’m not at all sorry you've rid us of that bugger: 
he’d soon have done the same to us, be sure of it.” 

I pull out my knife, wipe it dry, and I discharge: never has a 
murder checked an ejaculation, to the contrary. Then, lighting my 
pipe, ““Go on, my friencl,” I say to Tergowitz, ‘“‘I’d never have 
treated our comrade that way had I not long ago detected in him 
all the vices that are ruinous to a society such as ours. Let’s you 
and I now swear an oath of everlasting fidelity to each other, and, 
you'll see, we shall be able to get along very nicely without him.” 

We terminated our operation. Everything had been carried 
out according to plan. We sacked the house, the spoils were con- 
siderable; well paid, our allies left us very content; but I was loath 


Juliette %& 895 


to be separated from mine: I suggested to Carleson that he remain 
with me, and he agreed. Two mules transported our baggage; for 
mounts we had three fine horses; and so we went forth from Tiflis 
and, skirting the edge of the Black Sea, we came by and by to 
Constantinople. 

It was simply in the capacity of a valet we had Carleson with 
us; fond of him though I was, I sensed full well that a dozen or 
fifteen discharges inside his magnificent ass would appease my 
passion, and I was wary of putting him on an equal footing with 
us, lest in so doing I create a potentially dangerous rival. 

Some highway robberies, a few rapes, as many murders— 
the obvious and easy line of action to take in a country where 
neither justice nor security exists : that fairly sums up our adventures 
in Asia Minor, and we arrived as serenely and surely in the Grand 
Turk’s capital as if we did not merit a hundred times over to appear 
nowhere there but on the gallows. 

Foreigners do not reside in Constantinople itself, they estab- 
lish themselves at Pera, a suburb. We repaired thither with a view 
to taking a few days of rest before returning to our trade, which, 
plied with some success up until now, had put Tergowitz and me 
in possession of two hundred thousand francs each. 

However, after consultation with my partner, I wrote to my 
sister, asking her to have funds and letters of recommendation for 
Constantinople sent to me, and also for Italy, whither we in- 
tended to go after leaving the Ottoman provinces; and before two 
months were out I received everything I could want to facilitate 
our enterprises. Straightway introducing myself to the banker with 
whom a credit had been opened for me, I shortly became the 
admirer of the sixteen-year-old girl he prized above all else in this 
world, and was raising as though she were his own child rather 
than an adopted one. Philogone was fair-haired, candid in her 
manner, and naive, had the loveliest possible eyes, in a word, the 
whole effect was eminently winning. But here something very odd 
occurred. Through some strange caprice, not uncommon among 
true libertines and only comprehensible to them, although 
Philogone was attractive in the extreme, although the feelings she 
inspired in me were properly overpowering, I was moved, as I 
gazed upon her, by no desire other than to have her fucked by 


896 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Tergowitz; that idea alone filled out my prick, I frigged it, dwell- 
ing upon nothing else. I took the Hungarian to the house of 
Philogone’s protector, Calni was his name; afterward, as we were 
walking home, I revealed my designs to my friend, who seemed 
much pleased by them. 

‘In all this I toil for your benefit, comrade, only for yours.” 

“It would appear to me,” Tergowitz replied, “that we might 
broaden our objectives. This moneychanger, they say, is one of the 
richest in Constantinople; while that girl is being attended to, could 
we not also rob her gua:-dian? I expect that we might then be able 
to travel through Italy in greater style and comfort.” 

“Doubtless,” said 1, “but what you suggest there shall not be 
easy; force is not on our side here, we shall have to resort to ruse. 
Such being the case, let us start by sowing. a hundred thousand 
crowns in order to reap two million; do you disapprove ?” 

“No.” 

“Then leave everything to me.” 

I began by renting a country house; the one I chose was 
superb, isolated, and at 2 good distance from the city. As soon as I 
had filled it with elegant furnishings and hired a flock of domestics, 
I arranged fashionable gatherings every evening, and Philogone 
and Calni were of course among my guests. Tergowitz passed for 
my brother; to create the most favorable conditions for his moves 
was my concern, and I thought to prepare the terrain by subtly 
hinting at projects for an alliance: I was ever more willingly 
listened to. Only one thing stood in the way of my desires: that 
wretched girl, against whom I was inwardly plotting the most 
atrocious horrors, had taken it into her head to fall in love with 
me. 

“Surely, Sir, such clesigns are very flattering,” she told me 
after I had finished speaxing of my brother’s ambition, “‘but since 
my guardian has left me free to choose, honesty compels me to say, 
and I say it frankly, that I would have preferred it had you made 
this proposal in your own behalf.” 

“Lovely Philogone,”’ I declared, ‘‘such words are wonderfully 
sweet to a man’s pride and self-esteem; but I must answer you in 
the same forthright language. Certain regrettable tendencies, for 
which I am not responsible, render me absolutely indifferent to 


Juliette Qe 897 


women; and, if you were to become mine, the obligation you would 
come under to ape the sex I prefer would not make you as happy 
as you deserve to be.” 

Seeing that Philogone did not grasp my meaning, I called 
upon the resources of libertine expression to explain to her that the 
shrine in which women sacrifice to love was not the one where I 
was wont to repair, and in exchange for the elucidation she re- 
quested of me I earned myself a complete view and thorough 
handling of this beautiful girl’s charms, who, with the candor and 
innocence of her age, trustingly surrendered the whole of herself 
to me. Ye gods! what exquisite forms! what purity of line, of color! 
what graces! and, above all, what a delicious ass! When, opening 
its orifice, peeping inside, I was obliged, in pursuit of my demon- 
stration, to tell Philogone that ‘twas here the temple in which I 
offered my homage, ‘‘Little do I care,” was the charming creature’s 
answer ; ‘oh, Borchamps, of such things I know nothing, but must 
not all my body be yours when you so firmly possess my heart?” 

“No, siren, no!” I cried, fondling her peerless behind, “no, do 
what you will . . . love me, worship me, it will be to no avail, I 
shall not be melted, who for women can feel no pity nor any decent 
emotion; ’tis the promise of pleasures of no very delicate order 
which excites me as I toy with you; and my heart is as immune to 
love as to any other human virtue.” Then letting fall her skirts: 
“No, Philogone, I cannot marry you, I say; my brother can make 
. you a happy woman, and he will.” 

Thus did a year go by, and during it confidence was estab- 
lished. Establishing it did not, however, engross all my time; I 
busied myself with the loveliest Jewesses, the prettiest Greek girls, 
and the most handsome boys in Constantinople, and to make up for 
all I had lost during my long-enforced abstinence in Siberia, I 
conversed with better than three thousand individuals in the one 
sex and the other in the course of that year. For a thousand 
sequins, a Jew, who traded in precious stones and had Ahmed’s 
sultanas among his customers, permitted me to accompany him 
into the harem; and there, risking my life, I fucked six of the 
Grand Turk’s most beautiful wives. They were all habituated to 
sodomy, and 'twas of their own accord they proposed a route 
whereby they avoided pregnancies. Rarely did the Sultan, who 


898 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


always mixes them with his castrati, approach them otherwise than 
from the rear; preparatorily, they anoint this part with a certain 
essential oil which shrinks it to such narrowness that you cannot 
embugger them without bloodshed. My wishes went farther: I 
keenly desired to fuck < few of those famous eunuchs, in whose 
asses the Grand Turk is so prone to forget women; but since he 
keeps a much closer guard upon these personages than upon his 
sultanas, there is no possible way of obtaining access to them. 
Ahmed, I was informed, owned some who were twelve years old, 
in beauty surpassing anything to be encountered on earth. I asked 
for a description of his tastes. 

“His favorite passion,” one of his wives told me, “‘is as 
follows. A dozen sultanas, standing very close the one to the next 
and displaying nothing but their buttocks, form a circle inside which 
he takes up his position with four of his castrati. At a signal from 
him those twelve women must simultaneously shit into the twelve 
porcelain pots that have been placed for that purpose on the floor 
beneath their asses: she who fails to produce her mard when it is 
demanded, dies. Not a month passes but seven or eight wives pay 
the extreme penalty for this crime; and ’tis the Sultan who exe- 
cutes them, secretly: the manner in which he puts them to death 
is unknown. Once they have shat, a castrato goes around and 
collects the pots and brings them to His Highness, who sniffs them, 
inhales their aroma, dips his prick in the contents, and smears him- 
self therewith: after which the pots are laid aside, one castrato 
embuggers him while another sucks his device; the third and fourth 
give him their pricks to fondle and frig. A few moments of this 
and then the four little darlings shit one by one into his mouth, and 
he swallows. The circle now breaks up; each woman must lick 
and suck his mouth and tongue; he pinches their breasts and claws 
their behinds while they do; as one by one the women are dismissed, 
they go to a long couch and lie down upon it in a row; once they 
are all aligned there, tke castrati, wielding switches, advance and 
whip three apiece; when the boys have bloodied those dozen be- 
hinds, the Sultan inspects them, sucks the bruises, and licks those 
shit-splashed asses and those still replete assholes. That done, he 
turns back to his bardashes and embuggers the four of them in 
succession; but these are only preliminary exercises. His tour of 


Juliette % 899 


the boys’ asses concluded, the women seize them and offer them to 
him; he lashes them one after the other, and in the meantime all 
those who are otherwise unoccupied cluster around him and, silent 
throughout, manifest an amazing skill in striking a wide variety of 
the very obscenest attitudes. When the four children have been 
flogged they are presented to him, he encules them afresh; but at 
the moment his discharge threatens, he withdraws in a fury, hurls 
himself at one of the women, who are now standing motionlessly 
in a ring around him, their faces turned his way. He attacks one of 
them and beats her until she sinks to the ground, unconscious; he 
refucks a second bardash, whom he also abandons in order to ad- 
minister a beating to a second woman; it is likewise with the third 
and fourth bardash; and it is as he is beating the last woman— 
who, often as not, perishes beneath his blows—that his fuck spurts, 
without his having to bother to touch his member. The four 
women very frequently succumb from the hard use they have re- 
ceived, and those who survive are at least two or three months 
recovering in bed. He usually strikes them on the head and chest, 
as forcefully as he can, and were they to offer the slightest re- 
sistance they’d be strangled on the spot.” 

“There indeed,” said I to the sultana who was recounting 
these marvelous things to me, ‘there indeed is a very extraordinary 
passion and most surely I too would adopt it, were I as wealthy as 
your master.” 

“Sometimes the Sultan sees his wives individually, and ’tis 
then he embuggers them. But this great favor is never granted to 
any save the prettiest and who are not over eight years old.” 

Being at last ready to realize my fell designs regarding the 
lovely Philogone, at the cost of a few sequins I had her protector’s 
house burned to the ground. Calni’s immediate decision was to 
remove to my country manor, bringing with him not only Philogone 
and his capital, but a number of trusty servants and retainers be- 
sides : [ had not anticipated their arrival with that escort. However, 
I shortly found a way to persuade Calni that this crowd of valets 
would be far more usefully employed tidying the debris of his 
house than standing about idle in mine, where my own servants 
could attend to his needs. Dazed by the calamity that had just 
befallen him, Calni did as I suggested. The treasure chests were 


900 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


already under my roof, and Calni was about to begin conducting 
his affairs from there, when we decided to defer action no longer. 

“Sir,” said I, walking into his bedroom one fine morning, a 
pistol in my hand, while Tergowitz was posted at the front door as 
a lookout and I had put my Carleson in charge of Philogone and 
the single valet who could have come to Calni’s aid; “dear and 
loyal sir, you were sadly mistaken if you assumed you were getting 
my hospitality for nothing. Bid this world farewell, my friend: 
you have enjoyed a rich man’s life long enough, it is time that your 
money pass into other hands.” 

And firing my shot as I pronounced these last words, I sent the 
banker to settle in hell any debts he might have outstanding. For 
his part, Carleson dropped out a window the corpse of the valet he 
had just killed, and he a.nd I pinioned the damosel, who was utter- 
ing heart-rending wails and shrieks. Then I summoned Tergowitz. 

“My friend,” I said, ‘the moment is at hand; be mindful of 
the trouble and expense I have incurred to prepare this scene, and 
fuck this girl for me, right now, before my eyes, while I bum-tup 
you and Carleson sodomizes me.” 

Tergowitz, nothing loath to comply, speedily divests the lass 
of her clothing; and the world’s fairest body lies quivering at our 
disposal. My stars! What buttocks! Never, I repeat, had I seen 
any so beautiful, better-shaped, more cunningly cleft: I could not 
refrain from paying them an homage. But when the brain is fixed 
upon a piece of libertinage and heated by the idea, not even the 
devil can alter the course of things. I did not want Philogone, I 
was tempted by nothing except the ass of him who was to fuck her. 
Tergowitz encunts, I embugger Tergowitz, Carleson fucks me, and 
after a furious ride lasting perhaps an hour, we all three discharge 
as one man. 

“Turn her over, by God!” I cry to my friend. ‘Do you not 
see she has the best ass in existence ? Carleson will encunt her, and 
I shall fuck you both.” 

The act is consummated despite the lovely orphan’s tears and 
screams; and before another hour has gone by there’s not a temple 
of Cythera to which we have not shown her the way. My friends 
were in a lather, Tergowitz especially; I alone remained cool 
before that heavenly girl, or if she inspired any desires in me, they 


Juliette 2 901 


were so ferocious and depraved that satisfying them, I’d have 
deprived my comrades of her there and then. Never had my 
perverse tastes expressed themselves against anyone so resolutely 
as against that girl; I felt as though there were no torture violent 
enough to inflict upon her, and I had to reject as too mild, too 
modest, everything my imagination was devising. My rage was at 
the pitch where it was proclaimed in my eyes; I could no longer 
gaze upon that creature save I was gripped by every vicious, every 
murderous impulse. Can you tell me what it was bred such feel- 
ings in me? I myself do not know; I simply describe to you what I 
experienced. 

“So let us get ourselves gone from here,” said I to my 
friends; “a prudent man cannot be concerned for pleasures alone. 
Our belongings are aboard a felucca, waiting for us at the port 
and ready to sail, I have chartered it to Naples. Let’s not tarry; 
after the pranks we have just performed, we'd be well advised to 
move on... . And this girl, Tergowitz, say: what’s to be done 
with her ?” 

“We are taking her along, I presume,” the Hungarian replied, 
and I detected something mutinous in his eye. 

‘Ah ha! In love, comrade?” 

“No, but since we’ve gone to the point of buying the slut 
with her guardian’s blood I see no reason not to keep her.” 

And thinking it appropriate to say nothing at this juncture 
lest some dissension arise which could jeopardize our safety, I 
nodded as though in agreement with Tergowitz, and we set forth. 

Carleson soon noticed however that I had merely acted from 
expediency in consenting to have Philogone accompany us. He 
spoke to me about it. In the belief I had no cause to be secretive 
with him, I gave him plain answer, and on the second day at sea 
we decided to get quietly rid of these two turtledoves, and that 
thereafter I would be sole proprietor of our hoard. I exchanged a 
few words with the captain of the vessel; a few sequins won me 
his sympathy. 

“Bah,” said he, ‘‘do as you like, but beware of that woman 
you see over there by herself. She seems to think she knows you, 
and if it’s true, you'll gain nothing from being observed by her.” 

“Fear not,” I assured him, ‘‘we shall choose our moment 


902 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


well.” Then casting an involuntary glance at the creature who 
according to the captain claimed to be acquainted with me, I told 
myself that for a certainty he was mistaken, in this sorrowful 
personage seeing nothing but a woman apparently of some forty 
years, occupied as a servant to the crew and whose features had 
been prematurely aged by hardship, distress, and weariness. There- 
fore I put her completely out of my mind and gave all my atten- 
tion to our scheme; once the veils of night had overspread the sea, 
Carleson and I laid hands on our slumbering comrade and slipped 
him quietly over the board. Philogone, wakened, heaved a deep 
sigh; it was not, she said, that she so much regretted the Hungar- 
ian, but that in all the world she loved nobody but me. 

“Dear and unlucky child,” was my response, ‘‘your love is 
very ill requited. I cannot endure women, my angel, I’ve told you 
so.” Then dropping Carleson’s breeches within her full view, “You 
can see here,” I went on, “how those individuals are made who 
have a right to my favors.” 

Philogone blushed and a few tears rolled down her cheeks. 

“But how the devil can you love me,” I demanded, “after the 
crime you have just witnessed me committing ?” 

“Tis a dreadful deed, to be sure; but what power has one 
over one’s heart? Oh, Sir, were you to assassinate me, still I would 
love you.” 

Whereupon the conversation began. 

The melancholy woman had approached us quietly, and with- 
out seeming to be listening, she lost nothing of what we were 
saying. 

‘What were you doing in Calni’s house?” I asked Philogone. 
‘Such protection is not given for nothing; was love involved in all 
that ? When the bond of kinship is absent, it’s seldom a man keeps 
a girl in his house save his purposes be lewd.” 

“Calni’s sentiments, Sir,” Philogone answered, “‘were of the 
purest; his conduct was always above reproach, he was a kind- 
hearted man. Some sixteen years ago, while journeying in Sweden, 
my guardian, stopping at an inn, found a destitute young woman 
whom he conveyed with him to Stockholm, whither he was called 
upon business. This young woman was pregnant; my guardian saw 
to her needs, remained at her side; she gave birth to me. Calni, 


Juliette ae 903 


seeing that my mother was in no position to raise me, asked her to 
entrust me to him. Having had no children by his wife, they both 
took the most devoted care of me, and I grew up in their house.” 

“What became of your mother?” I interrupted, a curious 
presentiment suddenly forming in my mind. 

“T do not know. We left her in Sweden. She had no resources; 
apart from the aid Calni gave her—” 

“And which did not enable her to get very far,” broke in she 
who had been following our words. 

And casting herself at our feet: ‘‘Philogone! behold her who 
brought you into the world; and you, Borchamps, look pityingly 
upon the ill-starred Clotilda Tilson you seduced in London after 
having wrought the ruin of her family, and whom, when this poor 
child was in her womb, you abandoned at a Swedish inn, riding off 
with a barbarous woman who called herself your wife.” 

“Fuck!” I said to Carleson, very little moved by this theatri- 
cal speech, “would you believe it? At a single stroke fate restores 
both my wife—and she is charming, is she not—and an exceedingly 
pretty daughter. Eh, Carleson! Do you not weep?” 

“No, by God,” heartless Carleson replied, “instead of that 
I'm stiffening, for I visualize some delightful episodes that could 
contribute an added piquancy to this adventure.” 

“We see eye to eye, dear boy,” I whispered to him; ‘‘however, 
allow me to handle the affair: I shall soon provide you with a 
striking demonstration of the way in which Nature’s deepest im- 
pulsions affect me.” 

Then turning back tenderly to Calni’s ward, ‘Oh, Philogone,” 
I exclaimed, “you are my daughter, yes: I recognize you by the 
sweet stirrings the sight of you causes in my bowels. . . . And you, 
Madame,” I continued, hugging my blessed spouse’s neck nearly 
to the point of strangling her, “ah yes, you are my wife, I 
recognize you too... .” 

I now placed them side by side. “Kiss me, dearest ones, kiss 
me! Philogone, my beloved Philogone! Behold sublime Nature’s 
sentiments: yesterday, I had precious little desire to fuck you, now 
I burn to do so.” 

Both women recoiled in instinctive horror; but Carleson and 
I quieted them, made them understand that I held their fate in my 


904 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


xs 


hands. They mastered their shyness. And though they were my 
wife and daughter, they had much more the appearance of a pair 
of slaves. 

My desires had become so intense I could scarce control 
myself. I would now be absorbed in admiring Philogone’s sublime 
hindquarters, the next instant all I wanted was to study the state 
into which poverty and prief had reduced Clotilda’s charms. And 
lifting the skirts of both at once, my two eyes sufficed not to stare 
at them nor my two hands to feel and probe them; I kissed, I 
foraged, I plotted... . Carleson frigged me. All my former ideas 
changed touching the lovely ass of my new-found daughter ; strange 
indeed are the ways of Nature, aye, unimaginable: Philogone as 
Calni’s ward left me cold, now that she was mine the same Philo- 
gone brought my prick up all afire. My cruel desires remained 
unaltered; previously, they had been isolated, now they marched in 
step with those of fucking this glorious girl: whereof I quickly 
convinced her, jabbing my engine into her asshole; whereat she 
uttered piercing screams. The ship’s captain heard them and came 
softly up to me. 

“Sir,” said he, “I fear lest your conduct scandalize the crew; 
our vessel is small, and for the kind of activity you wish to indulge 
in more space would be preferable. At present we are not far off 
the shore of a little island, deserted, and disadvantaged only by the 
great quantity of bats and owls that are to be found on it, and 
which is the reason why tuman beings have always avoided it. But 
a pleasant hour may be spent there. We are going to land, our 
sailors will make their supper ashore and you can amuse yourself 
a while.” 

These overtures gave me the opportunity to relate to the 
captain how I had just rediscovered a long-lost wife and daughter. 

“A daughter !” said he. “But were you not fucking her a short 
while ago?” 

“True, I was. In these matters I am not hindered by many 
scruples.” 

“Aye, Sir, you Frenchmen are right; better to eat the fruit 
of the tree you've planted than leave it for others to enjoy. As for 
that poor creature,” he went on, “if it’s your wife chance has re- 
stored to you, then I congratulate you. We've known her for quite 


Juliette & 905 


some time, she’s made these voyages with us often. Though she’s 
poor, she’s as honest and decent a woman as ever we've seen; every 
man aboard will tell you so.” 

“Friend,” I said to the mariner, “I do not doubt it for an 
instant; but this woman you are praising once behaved abominably 
toward me; and I shall not pretend otherwise,” I added, dropping 
several more coins in his palm, ‘“‘my aim in wishing to go ashore on 
this island is to obtain my revenge.” 

“Why, Sir, bless my soul,” the captain replied, “do as you 
like, I’1] not meddle in your private affairs.” Lowering his tone, and 
looking at me with deep understanding: ‘‘When you return to the 
ship you have merely to say that she slipped and fell into the 
water....” 

Enchanted by this good man’s amicable candor, | take leave: 
of him and report our conversation to Carleson, then expose my 
homicidal projects. Scarcely was I done speaking when the ship 
cast anchor. 

“Captain,” 
little time... .” 

“I am at your service, my Lord, and in your hire alone; we'll 
not set sail again until you are ready to be off.” 

And we started inland. 

“Oh, my friend,” I declared to Carleson as we walked along, 
“the pleasures we are going to receive from these two whores! 
This, I sense it already, will be the most arousing of all my 
murders; look at my prick,” I said, stopping, “‘just look at it foam 
with rage... I like this island, Carleson. What solitude! We shall 
be able to accomplish wonders.” 

A short while later we spied a little ravine delightfully shaded 
by willow trees and poplars, the ground covered by fresh green 
grass; bushes screened the place on all sides. 

“Let us settle ourselves here,” I said to my friend. “Tis the 
very finest weather, we shall take off our clothes. Naked like 
savages, we'll imitate them in appearance as well as in deeds.” 

After kissing Carleson with all possible lewd fervor, “Come,” 
I said, “‘let’s get to work on them. But mark you now, not a drop 
of fuck until those sluts have sighed up the ghost.” 

With that I fling both those women down upon the grass; I 


said I, disembarking with my family, “give us a

embugger my daughter, I examine the afterparts of my wife, of 
that Clotilda I’d so adored in days bygone and whom I found 
beautiful even now; from the ass of the one I shifted straight into 
the ass of the other. Carleson was bum-fucking me; I forgot my 
own words and discharged, but while in the act biting my daughter’s 
breasts so cruelly that J left them covered with blood. Still erect, I 
fit my member into my daughter’s cunt. “Here,” I say to Calni’s 
protégée while kissing her mother’s buttocks, ‘open your womb 
and receive the fuck that gave you life.” 

But, forever incoristant, it’s now Clotilda I encunt; she gets 
fuck from me again wh le this time I worry my daughter’s buttocks 
as fiercely as I’d bitten her teats. 

“Not so fast, Carleson,” I say as I withdraw, “you must 
sodomize our two whores, I’ll hold them still for you. First one, 
then the other.” 

My valet embuggers, I lick his testiclesp—I worshiped that 
splendid fellow—; I get to my feet and suck his mouth while he 
looses his seed into mv wife’s behind; my daughter is promptly 
given like treatment. I fuck him while he saws away in that un- 
fortunate girl’s anus. 

‘‘And now,’ I said as soon as he was finished, ‘“‘some entertain- 
ment at our victims’ expense.” 

Having my Carleson stand up, I require the two whores to 
lick every part of his body, not omitting his member, his asshole, 
and the spaces between his toes, his armpits also. I engage him to 
shit upon a thornbush and I oblige those women to go there and eat 
his excrement, though it means getting their faces scratched and 
torn; next, we catch them by the hair, thrust them head first back 
into the same bush, drag them out, toss them back in again, till the 
thorns have cut them to the bone; nothing so poignant, so heart- 
rending as their screams, nothing so keen as the pleasure we derive 
from them... . 

‘“O just Heaven! What have I done to be treated in this 
way ?” Philogone gasped, falling to her knees and imploring mercy. 
“O you who call yourself my father, if it be true that I am your 
daughter prove it by treating me more kindly; and you, my mother 

. my unhappy mother, must we be dealt the same blow at the 


Juliette & 907 


very moment Heaven's hand guides us back to each other? Father! 
oh, my father, I have not deserved this fate! Spare me—”’ 

But without even listening to these plaints, Carleson and I 
garrote the two sluts and, gathering us each a handful of thorns, we 
lash them as hard as we can. Wounds soon develop everywhere; no - 
more is needed to straighten my prick anew; with incredible delight 
I lap the blood oozing from Philogone’s lacerated body. It is my 
own blood, I reminded myself, and the idea added a further inch to 
my blinding erection. I savor that voluptuous mouth which opens 
only to implore me; I press ardent kisses to those eyes moistened by 
tears my fury causes to flow; and from time to time returning to my 
dear Clotilda’s ass, I treat it with similar ferocity; then, clutching 
Carleson’s to me, I devour it with caresses and suck his marvelous 
prick. 

‘“‘We must place them in another posture,” I declare. 

We untie them and make them kneel; cords fixed to nearby 
trees maintain their arms in the air, heavy stones laid over their 
calves and ankles immobilize them completely. So placed, both 
expose their inspiring breasts to us. Nothing so fair, so lovely as 
Philogone’s; Clotilda’s, though a shade less firm, look still to be 
perfectly preserved. This sight brought my irritation to its climax. 
Oh, the pleasure to be reaped from severing the bonds uniting us to 
others! I have the two of them kiss my behind; I shit into their 
mouths, then, while buggering Carleson, I take hold of those 
breasts, lift them, and shave them all four off close to the chest; 
then, threading those chunks of fiesh upon a string, out of them I 
compose necklaces for the two women; they are streaming blood 
and in that state are further wet by the last spurts of fuck which I 
ejaculate over their bodies while Carleson skewers my ass. 

“That ought to do,” I say; ‘‘we may leave them there, tied as 
they are: the animals of this island will be another three or four 
days finishing them off. Better that they die slowly than that, dis- 
patched by us, they be deprived of the possibility of further suffer- 
ing.” 

Carleson, who is exceedingly ferocious of character, was 
terribly eager to complete the work there and then so as not, he 
said, to be cheated of the pleasure of seeing the pair expire; but 
once I had convinced him that the course I proposed was the more 


908 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


villainous one, he gave in and we prepared to bid the ladies adieu. 

“God in Heaven!” Clotilda groaned, “is this to what an 
original sin will lead us! Deep is my guilt owing to that monster, I 
‘admit it; but dear God, how severe is thy retribution!” 

“Hal This that we are hearing, good friend,” say I to 
Carleson, ‘“‘sounds very much like rebellion against the Supreme 
Being; let us avenge the God we so mightily revere, you and I. The 
blasphemer’s punishment used to be to have his tongue cut out, 
justice must not be allowed to languish; furthermore, it is essential 
that these whores be prevented from talking.” 

And, going up to them, we force open their mouths and slice 
three inches off each of their tongues. 

“Since they cannot speak any more,” Carleson says to me, 
“there is no reason on earth why they ought to be able to see; let’s 
gouge out the lovely eyes which once melted your heart. . . .” 

And my prompt response to that wise proposal was to prick 
out Philogone’s while Carleson blinded Clotilda forever. 

“Well and good, so far as it goes; but,” I ask, “might not the 
sluts bite at the scavenge:rs that will be coming to feed on them?” 

“They are surely apt to try.” 

“Then we must break their teeth.” 

For that operation we employ a stone; not wishing to damage 
our patients further, lest they be totally insensible to the ravages 
the wild creatures of the .sle are soon to inflict upon them, we take 
our departure. A hundred paces brought us to a little hillock; from 
its summit we had a clezr view of the thing. Owls, bats, all the 
beasts of prey that abounded on that island had already arrived: 
soon one saw nothing but a dark mass. 

“Oh, my brave Carleson,” I exclaimed, “what a spectacle! 
How comforting it is, to ave wives and daughters of one’s own to 
treat in this manner. And how sorry I am that I do not have a 
hundred other persons to feel just as close to: not one of them 
would escape me. Dear Carleson, see how the sight gladdens me; 
come, let me sodomize your peerless ass yet again while I watch.” 

I embugger, I frig my friend, and after having each dis- 
charged one last time, we head back toward the shore. 

We had a little story ready for the captain; that and a few 


Juliette 2 909 


sequins, nothing more was needed; and we landed at Naples on the 
third day after our Owl Island expedition. 

Wishing to settle in Italy, I straightway inquired about land 
for sale in this fair country and purchased the estate upon which 
you see me dwelling today. But, rich though | was, I found it 
impossible to give up my brigand’s vocation; it has too many 
charms to be abandoned, it too well suits my inclinations for me 
ever to be able to embrace some other; theft and murder have be- 
come the prime necessities of my life; I would simply cease to exist 
were I deprived of the pleasure of indulging in them every day. 
Here I exercise my honorable profession as of old great vassals 
used to do throughout the dominions that were theirs; I have a 
small army in my hire; Carleson is my lieutenant; ‘twas he who 
arrested you on the road; ’twas he I left in charge when I journeyed 
to Paris to fetch my sister, with whom I was so eager to be 
reunited. 

Despite the influence, the power, the wealth she enjoyed, 
Clairwil did not hesitate to leave everything behind in order to 
throw in her lot with mine; my dedication to crime appealed to her, 
she looked with favor upon the position I had attained for myself. 
Joining me, she counted upon being more than ever in a position to 
satisfy those fierce passions for which she is generally known. | 
remained three months in Paris while she readied her departure; 
then we returned together to this den of crime and infamy. Out of 
a mutual decision to reinforce our existing ties by whatever could 
consolidate them most intimately, we were married on our way 
hither, at Lyon; and our hope today is that no circumstance shall 
ever arise to separate two persons so admirably suited to each 
other, and who, notwithstanding their execrable penchants, will 
always make an exquisite and delightful duty of welcoming into 
their retreat and cherishing such sincere friends as yourselves. 


“Oh, Juliette,” asked Clairwil when once her brother had 
finished speaking, “do you find such a man a worthy partner for 
me?” 

- “He is, surely, most worthy of all those who are intelligent 


910 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


enough to feel that the highest of all laws is the one bidding the in- 
dividual to pursue his happiness, setting aside anything others may 
say or think.” 

Borghese clasps us in her arms, we all exchange a thousand 
more kisses. Borchamps, whom henceforth we shall call by no other 
name, and Sbrigani seemed equally enchanted at making each 
other’s acquaintance; Elise and Raimonde congratulated them- 
selves upon seeing this conclusion to an adventure whereof the 
beginnings had caused them such keen alarm. 

We were all in the midst of these gay effusions when a scout 
entered to notify the captain that his riders were bringing in a 
coach containing an entire family and much money. 

“Excellent news,” replied Clairwil’s amiable brother; “these 
persons, I trust, shall be material suitable to answer voluptuous 
purposes, and as for the money, its arrival could not be more 
timely, for if you are of my mind, our next step should be to spend 
several months in Naples.” 

“Agreed,” said Clairwil, squeezing my hand. 

“Very well,” Borchamps announced, ‘whatever funds this 
capture brings me, I devote every penny to our trip.” 

At that point the prisoners appeared. 

“Captain,” said Car.eson, who entered at the head of the band, 
“today is indeed one for thanksgiving: this family is mine. Let me 
introduce my wife,” he continued, presenting a very attractive 
woman of thirty-four. ‘“These two girls,” he went on, first indi- 
cating the younger, thirteen years of age and lovely to see, then 
the other, fifteen, a creature before whom the Graces would have 
paled from envy, “are out of my testicle. Here is my son,” he 
added, offering us a sixteen-year-old youth of most engaging 
physiognomy. ‘““Two words from me to acquaint you with this 
affair; my wife may then explain the rest to you. Rosine is Danish; 
seventeen years ago, I made a journey to Copenhagen, met her 
there, and married her. ] was then eighteen; hence, am thirty-five 
now. 

“This handsome lad, whom I named Francisco, was the first 
fruit of our love; Christine over there,” and Carleson pointed to 
the girl of fifteen, ‘was the next; Ernelinde the last. Not long 


Juliette & 911 


after Ernelinde’s birth came my adventures in Russia; certain 
political deeds saw me deported to Siberia, from where I made my 
escape before associating with Borchamps in Tiflis. Chance re- 
stores this beloved family to me, I present it to you, beseeching 
you to do absolutely whatever you please with it: I should like to 
prove to my captain that I am as little concerned as he by ties of 
kinship.” 

“Madame,” Borchamps said to Rosine, “‘have the gracious- 
ness to satisfy our curiosity as regards the rest.” 

“Alas, my Lord,” said the beautiful Rosine, “abandoned by 
that perfidious man I made do as best I could during the first year 
of his absence; then, having come into a considerable inheritance, 
I devoted part of my money to searching for my husband through- 
out France and, more recently, in Italy, where I received positive 
assurance he was to be found: I hoped for nothing more than to 
guide his children to the happiness awaiting them in their father’s 
arms. What was my surprise when after all these years my first 
glimpse of him is at the head of a band of robbers. The monster! 
Such is the infamous trade he was plying while I, constantly at- 
tached to my duties, was, owing to his desertion, without even the 
bare necessities of life.” 

“Oh, this is touching, touching,” murmured Olympia.” “Our 
friend Borchamps, I trust, will exploit these circumstances to the 
fullest... .” 

“Madame,” Clairwil declared to the unhappy woman, ‘‘noth- 
ing in all you have just told us can exempt you from the common 
fate of those my husband’s soldiers take prisoner. Pray tell, to what 
does it amount, the fortune you bring us?” 

“One hundred thousand crowns, Madame,” Carleson’s ami- 
able wife replied. 

“One hundred thousand crowns,” Clairwil repeated. “A 
paltry sum.” Then, turning toward me: ‘‘Hardly enough to pay 
our rent in Naples.” 

“My friend,” said Rosine, addressing her husband, “together 
with that I brought you my heart, and these children begot of 
your heart’s ardor.” 


12 Tt will be remembered that this is Princess Borghese’s first name. 


912 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Ah,” said the lieutenant, ‘‘let’s not bother over trifles; such 
gifts aren't worth a pipeful of tobacco.” 

“T’ll be more generous in my estimate,” said I to Carleson, 
whom I was beginning to behold with considerable interest; “the 
pleasures we await from these four delicious objects are not to be 
despised.” 

“We shall soon verify whether or not that is so,” answered 
Carleson, who had already discerned much in my eyes; “‘but one 
thing is very certain, Madame, and that is that I believe there are 
few pleasures to rival what I await from you.” 

“Truly?” I replied, giving the agreeable fellow’s hand a 
tender little squeeze. 

“Tl wager it, Madame,” said he, to my lips pressing a kiss 
that foretold of his capabilities; ‘‘yes, and I am prepared to repay 
you in kind.” 

“May I suggest tha: we dine,” said the captain. 

‘With the whole family together ?” the lieutenant asked. 

“By all means,” said Madame de Clairwil; “I wish to see 
them all there before sending them somewhere else.” 

Orders are issued and the most magnificent dinner is served. 
Seated beside me, Carleson manifested great eagerness to possess 
me and, I must say, I was just as strongly drawn in the same 
direction. His children were timid in this company, abashed; his 
wife tearful and lovely; everybody else gay and exceedingly liber- 
tine. 


”

“Come,” said Borciamps, nodding toward Carlson and me, 
“‘let’s not make these two sweethearts languish any longer, they are 
fairly dying to come to grips.” 

“Yes,” said Borghese, ‘‘but the scene must be public.” 

‘She is right,” Clairwil agreed. “‘Carleson, the assembly gives 
you leave to fuck Juliettz, but that must be in its presence.” 

‘But what will my wife and children think ?” 

‘Why, bless me, whatever they like,” said I, taking Carleson 
by the sleeve and leading him to a couch; “‘all the saints in paradise 
might be on hand, my dear, and I'd not have myself any the less 
fucked by you.” 

And, drawing a monstrous engine out of his breeches, “Par- 
don, Madame,” I say to Rosine, “if I usurp pleasures which ought 


Juliette dk 913 


by rights to be yours alone, but, fuck my eyes, I have been lusting 
for your good man a little too long, and now that I’ve got hold 
of him, serve me he shall.” Those words were scarce out of my 
mouth when Carleson’s awesome prick had gone into the depths 
of my womb. 

“Look,” said the captain, dropping his breeches, “was I 
mistaken in claiming that my friend has the world’s fairest ass?” 

And, so saying, the bugger embuggers him, while Clairwil 
kisses me upon the mouth and takes hold of my clitoris, and 
Olympia thrusts three digits into my asshole. 

“Captain,” asked Sbrigani, ignited by this spectacle, ‘would 
you care for a penetration? Think you not this prick you see is in a 
state to satisfy you?” 

‘Fuck away, Sir, fuck away, my ass yawns,” said the outlaw; 
“‘but be so good as to palpate other asses while you stuff mine.” 

“Why, I shall post Elise’s to my right, Raimonde’s to my 
left, both within easy reach,” said Sbrigani, “and for your recre- 
ation, situate ahead of you that of the wife alongside that of the 
husband you are fucking and those also of their three children.” 

The group is arranged, and in less time than it takes to tell 
everybody discharges; and having voiced our determination to 
squander no further fuck on such childishness, by unanimous agree- 
ment we advance to more serious orgies. For the sake of clarifica- 
tion it behooves me to enumerate the participants in the drama. 

I beg therefore to remind you that we were twelve: Bor- 
champs, Sbrigani, Carleson, Clairwil, Borghese, and myself, those 
were the six who assumed active roles; our patients included Elise, 
Raimonde, Rosine, Francisco, Ernelinde, and Christine. 

‘“Carleson,” said Borchamps, uncovering the young Fran- 
cisco’s behind, “here is an ass to compete with yours, my friend, 
and I feel I am about to offer it homage quite as pure as those 
whereof yours has for such a long time been deserving from me.” 

And, while saying that, he was fondling, he was kissing, the 
prettiest pair of buttocks, the whitest, the firmest you shall ever 
behold. 

“I am opposed to this arrangement,” Clairwil protested, 

tis sinning against every law, divine and human, to prevent 
Carleson from depucelating his own son: this child is going to 


‘ 


’ 


oo? 


914 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ass-fuck me, his mother will finger my cunt; and the father will 
embugger his son while Elise and Raimonde give him the whip 
and while he handles the buttocks of Juliette to his left, Borghese 
to his right, both of whom will be giving the whip to Carleson’s 
two daughters, this before the eyes of Borchamps, embuggered by 
Sbrigani and assisting in the flagellatory operation being performed 
upon his lieutenant’s two children.” 

The stage is set, the actors begin, the young Francisco, per- 
fectly sodomized by his father, irreproachably sodomizes my 
friend; but her weeping attests to Rosine’s misgivings as she. 
lends herself to indecencies which appear to clash with her stand- 
ards of behavior. During these multiple couplings, the captain, 
esteeming himself less than sufficiently integrated into the scene, 
takes it into his head, al: the while he has Sbrigani’s prick in his 
fundament, to grab the younger of Carleson’s daughters; and, 
without the least preparation, the rake embuggers her, uttering 
oaths. The girl swoons; undeterred, the captain burrows deeper 
still, for he no longer encounters any resistance; the impression 
one has is that he means to split the wretch in two. Soon losing 
interest in her, he has at her sister; although fifteen years of age, 
she is so slender, so dainty, so delicate, that the introduction of 
Borchamps’ gigantean m2mber causes her vexations as keen and 
lesions as grave as those Ernelinde has just sustained. Nothing, 
however, halts the brigand’s prodigious efforts: he presses, braces 
himself, lunges, strikes bottom. 

“Oh, Carleson,” he cries in his enthusiasm, “those are asses 
whereof you may be prcud; rid me of these cunts, if you can, 
they’re ready for you.” 

Clairwil’s bowels, meanwhile, are washed by Francisco’s fuck, 
and the rascal, starting forward as though electrified, in one swift, 
smooth motion unseats her rider, whirls, and comes to rest with 
the boy’s prick lodged in her cunt, performing this acrobatic with- 
out the slightest disturbance to the father, who, throughout, is 
sodomizing his bewilderec son. Carleson at last unlooses his fuck; 
and Francisco’s ass becoming vacant, the captain, weary of females, 
promptly darts his prick thereinto, while I, swept away upon a 
wave of lewdness, rush up to lick this handsome man’s ass, which 
I have been hankering to taste for hours. Carleson, perceiving his 


Juliette & 915 


two daughters idle, encunts one of them while kissing the ass of 
the other and having himself flogged by Elise, whom Raimonde, 
by Sbrigani embuggered, frigs apace. New outpourings of fuck 
enjoin rearrangements. I am at last embuggered by the captain 
while his sister frigs me, and Carleson, frigged by Sbrigani, sod- 
omizes his wife while ass-kissing his three children held by Elise 
and Raimonde, whose cunts the bawdy fellow frigs, Olympia 
opening those parts to his fingers. 

“Oh, Borchamps!” I cried from where I was in the thick of 
the melee, ‘‘what pleasures [ have from your prick, and how I 
desired it!” 

“That will not prevent others from getting their share of it,” 
the captain answered, catching Borghese by the waist and sodomiz- 
ing her with a lunge; ‘“‘my apologies, Juliette, but to this splendid 
ass belongs much of the credit for my erection ever since we 
removed our clothes, my thoughts were upon it while fucking 
yours, ’tis yours [ shall now dwell upon while fucking this one.” 

Noticing Francisco spoiling from inaction, I single him out; 
my tastes are so odd, and the youth so fair, that I know not which 
sex to adopt with him. I suck him, devour his ass, I present mine 
to him, of his own accord he sodomizes me and I camp my cunt 
atop Rosine’s face; at length, spirits are appeased by a further 
series of discharges, and the captain avers that after having paid 
so much attention to men, the general concern, in what is to follow, 
must be for the delectation of the women. 

‘Women deriving only mediocre physical pleasures from 
the use of such children, our best advice to them,” said the captain, 
“would be to aim at mental enjoyments. Juliette, you’ll begin. 
Carleson, reclining upon the sofa, must present you with a well- 
hardened prick: you will pose yourself gently upon that prick, 
taking good care that it enters your anus; Clairwil and Borghese 
will be frigging you, one of them your cunt, the other your clitoris 
—and let them not begrudge you this kindness, they will have 
pleasures in their turn—; while you are keeping yourself busy in 
this manner, Elise and Raimonde will be striking a wide variety 
of lewd attitudes for my delectation; the victims will now approach 
you, one by one, on their knees: first this loyal wife who has come 
from so far to bring gold and offspring to Carleson; his son next, 


916 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


then his two daughters; the same father will lead them forward; 
you will decree a torture for each of these individuals, but a mild 
and simple torture for a start: our entertainments are to last for 
quite some time, hence the procedure must be by degrees. I shall 
take note of the sentences you pronounce, and they will be executed 
the instant you have completed your discharge.” 

Positions are tak2n, but my wicked cohorts wait until my 
brain is reeling from pleasure before sending the victims up to me. 
Rosine appears first; I order her brought near; I examine her in 
minute detail and, fincling her bosom superb, proclaim that her 
breasts shall be whipped. Francisco follows, I observe the beauty 
of his hinder parts, ’tis upon his buttocks the lash is to fall. Chris- 
tine crawls forward, I condemn her to eat the turd of the first one 
among us who may nappen to wish to shit. And the young 
Ernelinde, whose charraing countenance affects me, will get a pair 
of slaps from each of us. 

“Are you about to discharge, Juliette?” inquires Borchamps, 
whom my two tribades are overwhelming with obscene attentions. 

“Yes, by Jesus, I can contain myself no longer—oh, Carleson, 
your prick is performiny: wonders!” 

“There’s the signal,” says the captain; “let us carry out the 
first round of sentences. Borghese will judge next.” 

All the penalties I have imposed are undergone; but, by a 
wise decision, they are inflicted by some woman other than she who 
pronounces them. So it is Clairwil who, this time, puts my orders 
into effect, and as she is of a mind to be rid of the fuck deposited 
in her ass, ’tis her excrement Christine swallows. Ah, what ardor 
the whore then puts into fustigating Rosine’s fair breasts; by the 
thirtieth stroke she has bloodied them both, and the vixen kisses 
the wounds her ferocity has opened; getting to Francisco’s excellent 
ass, it is with undiminished fury the rascal lashes it. 

“Your turn now, Borghese,” says the captain. “I am in the 
hope,” he adds, “that Sbrigani, realizing our need of his weapon, 
has not dulled it too soon.” 

“Let the sight cheer you,” said Sbrigani, from my behind 
removing a stiff and unruly device and the next instant plunging 
it to the hilt in Borghese’s ass, “and I shall proceed just as cir- 


Juliette & 917 


cumspectly with this one. Count upon it, captain, Ill not discharge 
save in the last extremity.” 

Borghese sits in judgment; | become the executioner. 

“Increased severity,” says the captain, “remember, it’s step 
by step to lead them gradually to death—”’ 

“To death!’’ exclaimed Rosine. “Just heaven! What have I 
done to merit this ?” 

“Had you merited death, buggeress,” said Carleson, sodom- 
izing Borchamps, who nests in Raimonde’s ass the while he tongues 
Elise’s; “‘yes, fuck my eyes, had you merited it, whore, we'd con- 
demn you to something else. We here have the greatest respect 
for vice and the mightiest abhorrence for everything resembling 
virtue; firmly wrought principles found this way of thinking, and 
with your approval, my dear, we shall not deviate a hairsbreadth 
from our creed.” 

“Come along, Borghese, pronounce,’ 
energetically fucked by his favorite. 

“Rosine,” the hot-tempered Olympia announced, ‘“‘will receive 
from each of us half a dozen pricks from a bodkin here and there 
upon her person; the comely Francisco will have his buttocks 
bitten by his father, his member by all the ladies; the executioner 
will then administer twenty blows of a stick upon the back of 
Christine and will break two fingers on each of Ernelinde’s hands.” 

These punishments are begun by me: after having six times 
run the needle-sharp instrument well into Rosine’s plump breasts, 
I pass it to my friends, who one by one wield it upon the most 
sensitive areas of that beautiful body; her frightful husband dis- 
tinguishes himself, ‘tis inside her vagina the mischievous fellow 
delivers his six stabs; I see to the rest, and I execute with art and 
zeal enough to provoke everyone into a discharge. Clairwil replaces 
Borghese. 

“Increased severity, sister,’ 
the goal we are working toward.” 

“Never fear,” that harpy replies. “You will soon recognize 
your kin.” 

Carleson returns to the sofa, over his mast-high device the 
captain’s sister hovers, slowly engulfs its length in her ass; 


said the captain, being 


the captain says, ‘‘don’t forget 


918 << THE MARQU:S DE SADE 


Borghese and I frig her amain, and she formulates troubles for 
our victims to endure. 

“I would,” says she, “that a hot iron be applied to the two 
breasts of the wife of him embuggering me at present; I would,” 
the slut continued, ever ready to lose her head the moment she 
felt a prick tickling her entrails, ‘that four gashes be inflicted upon 
the pretty buttocks belonging to the youth whom my brother seems 
to be fucking while awaiting our verdict; I would have Christine’s 
buttocks seared, and a rinse of boiling oil injected into Ernelinde’s 
lovely ass, warming though may be the caresses I see Borghese 
bestowing upon it.” 

But then a very comical thing occurred: panic-stricken at the 
thought of the clyster intended for her, the girl let loose everything 
her bowels contained, flooding shit all over the floor. 

“Blast me,” storrned Borchamps, bestowing a tremendous 
kick upon the girl’s beh nd, who all but flew out the window some- 
one had just opened to air the room, ‘‘’tis an outrage if the 
wretched little whore’s throat is not cut on the spot.” 

‘‘What the devil is the matter?’ Clairwil demanded of her 
brother. “It’s nothing but shit, and you love shit; would it be 
Juliette’s you want instead? Come, have some then, my fingers 
feel her mard, she’ll hatch it into your mouth.” 

“Bah, we’re becoming a filthy lot,” the captain jubilated, 
fitting his lips to my vent and soliciting what he has heen put into 
hope of obtaining; “when you hear such words uttered, fuck is 
never far off.” 

I shit; would you believe it? He shits too, and ’tis into the 
mouth of Christine, whom he has had posted underneath his ass, 
the villain looses the broadside, simultaneously swallowing the 
dainty I produce for him. 

“Your pleasures are indecent in the extreme,” Clairwil ob- 
serves the instant before she has Francisco perform the same 
operation upon her face. 

“Ah, wench,” her brother calls to her, “‘you’re close to a 
yield of sperm, I can tell it from your infamies.” 

“Fuck!” she rejoins, “I wish to be stretched out on the floor, 
I wish to be rolled, to wallow in the nastiness that little jade has 
just spattered about.” 


Juliette & 919 


“Are you mad ?” Olympia exclaims. 

‘No, merely determined to satisfy my desires, as always.” 

Her wishes are obeyed, and it is while writhing in ordures 
the rascal is overtaken by her spasm. 

The punishments are resumed; Borghese metes them out. 

“Stay,” says the captain, seeing Olympia pick up the iron 
due to char Rosine’s breasts, “I must embugger this woman while 
you are torturing her.” 

He sodomizes; Olympia operates. 

“‘God’s prick and balls!” he cries, “how sweet it is to ass-fuck 
an object undergoing pain! Woe unto him who passes through life 
in ignorance of that pleasure! There is no greater one in Nature.” 

But her fear notwithstanding, at the hands of her father, 
who embuggers her first, Ernelinde receives the formidable remedy 
prescribed by Clairwil; everything else on the program is accom- 
plished in like wise, which brings us around to fresh horrors. 

Carleson, berserk, and ever aroused by my ass, which, says he, 
has been driving him to this distraction, lays hands upon his 
children; he beats them, whips them, fucks them, while -we women 
frig one another opposite a spectacle which affords the idea of a 
wolf rampaging through a sheepfold. 

“Up, wench,” and it is Rosine who hears herself addressed 
by a Borchamps embuggering me and fondling the hindquarters 
of Olympia and of Raimonde, “’tis your turn, whore, you are 
going to torture your children; Carleson, put the point of your 
dagger to the abominable creature’s heart, and if she so much as 
wavers when told what to do, stab her straight to death.” 

Rosine is racked by sobs. 

“A little self-control,” Olympia advises; ‘‘signs of distress 
excite our cruelty. Weep, and it will go worse with you.” 

“Catch your elder daughter by the hair,” Borchamps shouts 
at her, ‘‘and you, Clairwil, issue the orders; Borghese will follow 
you; the last word will be Juliette’s.”” 

“I decree,” my friend said, ‘that the nasty creature chew 
blood from her daughter’s bubs.” 

Rosine seems paralyzed; the point of Carleson’s dagger pricks 
her skin; the unhappy mother obeys. 

“Olympia, what is your will ?” 


920 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“That she drip molten wax upon her daughter’s buttocks.” 

Again, manifestations of stubborness; again, prods from the 
dagger; again, compliance on the part of the sorry Rosine. 

“And you, Juliette ?” 

“Oh, I would have the girl given a general lashing by her 
mother, who shall lay on until she has drawn blood.” 

What difficulties before these instructions are finally carried 
out! At first, the strokes are so mild that they leave no trace 
behind; but Carleson’s dagger has its stimulating effect, Rosine 
plies the whip in great earnest, and in due time she flays the skin 
off her daughter’s ass. Comparable tortures are inflicted upon the 
others, each outdoing the other in horror. When my turn comes, 
one of my desires is that Francisco embugger the elder of his sisters 
while gashing his mother, and Borchamps, sodomizing me as I 
give that command, succumbs to its suggestiveness, inundating my 
bowels. 

“Fuck my eyes,” the captain swears, withdrawing from my 
fundament, his prick still up and purple, “enough of this, let’s get 
down to business: we shall begin by binding these four individuals 
belly to belly, so that they compose, as it were, one and the same 
body.” 

“Very well, and now ?” 

“Let each of the eight of us, armed with a red-hot poker, 
belabor this carrion a little... .” 

Then, after an hour of strenuous exertion: ‘“‘Rosine, take this 
dagger,” the captain says severely, “plant it in your son’s heart; 
his father will hold him while you do—” 

“No, barbarian, no!” that mother shrieks in despair. ‘‘No, 
twill rather go into my own heart—” and she would have ended 
her life had I not checked her arm in time. 

“Slut, you shall obzy!” roared Carleson. 

And seizing his w fe’s hand at the wrist, he himself guides 
the blade into his son’s breast. Clairwil, jealous at seeing herself 
excluded from the murder of this young man, she who only lives 
for masculine murders, snatches up a second knife and deals the 
wretch wounds a thousand times more grievous; Rosine is then 
stretched upon a narrow wooden bench, affixed to it, and then 
Borchamps would have Ernelinde open her mother’s body with a 


Juliette oe 921 


scalpel. The child refuses; menaces follow. Terrified, bruised, 
bloodied, excited by the hope of saving her life by consenting, her 
hand, steered by Carleson’s, yields to the barbarous instructions 
imparted to it. 

“You received your existence here,” says the cruel father 
once the opening has been made, “you must now return into the 
womb whence you emerged.” 

She is garroted, then pressed, twisted until by dint of much 
force and considerable art, there she is, breathing still, back inside 
the loins that once gave her to the world. 

“As for that other one,” says the captain, referring to Chris- 
tine, ‘she must be bound to her mother’s back. Wonderful, is it 
not,” he observed when that had been done, “the insignificant 
volume to which three women can be reduced.” 

“And Francisco ?” Clairwil wanted to know. 

“He’s yours,” Borchamps answered, “take him into a corner 
and finish him off in whatever way you like.” 

“Come with me, Juliette,” said Clairwil, leading the young 
man into an adjoining chamber. 

And there, a couple of frenzied bacchantes, we cause that 
unlucky youth to expire under everything of the cruelest and most 
refined it is in the power of ferocity to devise. Returning from 
those exercises, Carleson and Borchamps found us so aglow with 
beauty that neither could resist tupping us straightway; but at this 
the jealous Borghese begins to fume, protesting that the victims 
are being left to languish, and the pleasures of torturing them being 
delayed. The point is well taken, and since the hour is advanced, 
it is decided that supper will be served while play proceeds. 

“In that case,” says Borghese, upon whom the. right to pre- 
scribe punishment now devolves, having taken no hand in the 
tormenting and undoing of Francisco, “the victims must be dis- 
posed in front of us, flat on the table. The first of our pleasures 
will be derived from a view of the state they are already in, and 
this, I believe, is nigh to damnable; the second, from the effect of 
the further mistreatment they will sustain from us once they are 
there.”’ 

“Aye, set them on the table,” says Clairwil, “but I want to 
fuck before I sup.” 


922 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“But with whom?” I ask my friend. ‘‘They are all drained 
dry.” 

“Brother,” the insatiable creature resumes, “have ten of the 
prettiest members of your armed forces brought in, and give them 
to us for employment as sluts.” 

The soldiers appear; we all three, Borghese, Clairwil, and I, 
defying the pricks lifting threateningly at us, fling ourselves down 
upon cushions scattered about on the floor. Elise and Raimonde act 
as our aides. Sbrigani, the captain, and Carleson sodomize one 
another while watching us, and during four great hours, to the 
sound of our victims’ lamentations, the three of us fuck like the 
world’s mightiest whores: our champions, winded and spent, are 
dismissed. 

‘“What good is a man when he reaches the end of his erection ? 
Brother,” said Clairwil, “bring those ten louts back in here, where 
we can see it done, and have their throats cut this instant, if you 
please.” 

The captain issues instructions, twenty of his trusties seize the 
first ten, and the massacre goes forward while we frig one another, 
Borghese, Clairwil, and I. It is, so to speak, upon their corpses 
that a delicious collation is served to us. And there, naked, smeared 
with blood and fuck, drunk with lust, we carry our bestial ferocity 
to the point of mixing in our food those morsels of flesh we detach 
from the bodies of the unhappy women lying upon our table. 
Gorged on murder and impudicity, we at last all fall asleep amidst 
cadavers and a deluge of wines, spirits, shit, fuck, and bits of 
human flesh: I am not sure what happened after that. I simply 
recall that when I opened my eyes to the light I found myself 
lying between two cadavers, my nose in Carleson’s ass, with whose 
shit my gullet was filled, and whose prick was wedged in Borghese’s 
ass, where he had forgotten it. The captain, who had gone to sleep 
with his head pillowed on Raimonde’s shit-slimed buttocks, still had 
his prick in my behind, and Sbrigani was snoring in the arms of 
Elise . . . the victims in pieces still lay on the table. 

Such was the state n which the star of day found us out, and 
far from wondering at ur excesses, never, I believe, did it smile 
so brightly since the world was born. Thus, you see, it is false that 
heaven condemns men’s erring behavior, ’tis absurd to suppose 


Juliette & 923 


heaven offended thereby. Would it accord its favors to villains as 
well as to honest folk if it were annoyed by crime? 

“Why, no. No,” I said to my friends who, that morning, 
were listening calmly while I exposed my thoughts, “we offend 
nothing by surrendering to crime. A god? How incur his dis- 
pleasure when no god exists? Nature? Still less is Nature to be 
vexed by our misconduct,” I went on, summoning to mind the moral 
science upon which I had been nourished, excellent fare. ‘‘Man is 
in no wise Nature’s dependent; he is not even her child; he is her 
froth, her precipitated residue. No other laws govern him than 
those graved in mineral, in vegetal, in animal stuff; and when he 
reproduces, while he conforms to laws which are peculiar to him, 
he does nothing by any means necessary to Nature, nor by any 
means desired by her. Destruction more fully satisfies this universal 
mother, since it tends to restore to her a potential she is cheated 
of through our propagation. Thus, our crimes are pleasing to her, 
my friends, and our virtues are an affront; thus, atrocity in crime 
is what answers her most ardent desires; for he who were to 
serve her best would incontestably be him whose crimes through 
their number or magnitude destroyed even up to destroying the 
possibility of a regeneration which, perpetuated in the three king- 
doms, only narrows Nature’s capacity for further creative thrusts. 
Little fool that I was, oh, Clairwil! before we parted I was yet 
an adept of Nature; the systems I have absorbed since then have 
freed me from her, and moved me toward the simple laws of the 
natural realms. Having embraced these systems, ah, great dupes 
we must me, dear friends, if ever we deny anything to the passions, 
since they become the motor forces of our being, and we are just 
as unable to turn a deaf ear to their promptings as we are to be 
born again, or to return to being unborn. Indeed, these passions 
are so inherent in us, so necessary to the functioning of our inner 
workings, that their satisfaction becomes fundamental to our 
existence. Oh, dear Clairwil,” I continued, taking my friend’s hand 
warmly in mine, “the degree to which I am now these passions’ 
slave! Oh, whatever they might be, how willingly I would sacrifice 
everything to them! This victim or that, how little must it matter ! 
None more deserves to be spared than any other. If, according to 
popular prejudice, one existed which might seem to merit exception,

from the simple breaking of this curb my delights must increase: 
I would interpret the excessive foretaste of pleasure as a com- 
mand to act, and my hand would fly to do the bidding of my 
desires.’’'* 

A striking instance of the rewards fortune almost always 
lavishes upon great criminals now added its support to my argu- 
ments. 

We had scarce come out of the scene of horror I have just 
described when Borchamps’ troops rode in with six wagonloads 
of bullion that had been on its way to the Emperor, sent by the 
Venetian Republic. Only one hundred men were escorting this 
magnificent convoy when, in a mountain pass in the Tyrol, two 
hundred of our captain’s cavalry fell upon them and captured this 
hoard after an hour-long battle. 

‘There I am, rich for the rest of my life,” said Clairwil’s 
fortunate brother. “Notice, if you will, at what moment this hap- 
piness befalls us. "Tis into hands soiled by wife-killing, infanticide, 
sodomy, multiple murders, prostitution, and infamies that heaven 
deposits this treasure; ’:is to reward me for these horrors heaven 
puts it at my disposal. And you would have me doubt that Nature 
is otherwise than honcred by crimes? Ah, my thinking is not 
likely to change on this cuestion, and I shall go on committing them 
forever, since the consequences are so encouraging. Carleson,” said 
the brigand, “before we begin the count, from the contents of one 
of these wagons take a hundred thousand crowns, they’re yours, 
the gift testifies to the satisfaction I received from your courage 
and purposefulness during the late scene for which you supplied 
the actors.” 

Carleson kissed his commander’s knees in thanks. 

“I see no reason to hide it, fair ladies,” Borchamps said 
to us, “I am exceedingly fond of this lad, and when one loves, it’s 
‘with money you must prove it. At the beginning, of course, I sup- 
posed that the enjoyment would sooner or later pall; but it has 
been quite the other way, the more I discharge with this delicious 


13 May these excellent principles, taking firm root in good minds, make an end 
forever of the dangerous prejudices which are the cause for our regarding these 
passions as enemies, when from them alone is born the only felicity we can hope for 
on earth.

boy, the more attached to him [ become. A thousand pardons, 
Mesdames, ten thousand, but ’twould perhaps not be the same 
thing with any of you.” 

We passed several more days in Borchamps’ retreat; and 
then, seeing us eager to be off, he spoke to us as follows: 

‘“‘My thought, good friends, was to accompany you to Naples, 
the prospect pleased me. But with the wish that is mine soon to 
quit my present calling, I ought to dedicate myself to business 
rather than pleasure. My sister will go with you to that noble town, 
and here are eight hundred thousand francs to defray the costs 
of your stay. Hire an appropriate mansion upon your arrival, 
give out that the three of you are sisters—as indeed one might be 
ready enough to believe, certain features in common create a kind 
of resemblance among you. Sbrigani will continue to look after 
your affairs while you make the most of the numerous sinful op- 
portunities that magnificent city offers. Elise and Raimonde will 
be your chaperones. As for myself, I shall come to visit you if I can; 
amuse yourself, all three, and forget me not in your pleasures.” 

We left. I regretted Carleson, I admit it; I had, while a guest 
in Borchamps’ castle, got myself prodigiously fucked by that pretty 
fellow, whose prick had been admirable, and it was something of a 
hardship for me to forego it. My feelings had nothing to do with 
love: I have never worshiped that god; the question was merely 
of the need to be well fucked, and nobody satisfied it better than 
Carleson. The obligation, moreover, to hide our activities in order 
to avoid displeasing Borchamps, very jealous of his handsome 
lieutenant, had lent an out-of-the-ordinary flavor to the enjoyment 
of him, and our last farewells were sealed by a mutual inundation 
of fuck. 


Reaching Naples, we rented a superb house on the Chiagia 
quay, and passing ourselves as sisters, as the captain had advised, 
we gathered round us a royal entourage of domestics. First, we 
devoted a month to a careful appraisal of the morals and manners 
of this half-Spanish nation; we considered its government, its 
policies, its arts; its relations with the other nations of Europe. 
This study completed, we esteemed ourselves ready to sally forth 


926 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


into society. Our reputation as light ladies soon spread about. 
The King conceived a wish to see us; as for his wife, that spiteful 
woman did not look upon us with sympathy.’* Worthy sister to her 
who had married Louis XVI, this arrogant princess, after the 
example of all the other members of the House of Austria, sought 
to captivate her spouse’s heart solely in order to rule him politi- 
cally; ambitious like Marie Antoinette, it was not the husband she 
cared about, it was the kingdom she wanted. Ferdinand, slow- 
witted, simple-minded, blind—in fine, a king, Ferdinand fancied 
he had a friend in that headstrong wife, when in fact he had only 
a spy and a rival, and tke whore, like her sister, in devastating, in 
plundering the Neapolitan nation, toiled to the advantage of no- 
body except her Hapsburg tribe. 

Shortly after our presentation I received a billet from the 
King of Naples, couched in these or very similar terms: 

“To Paris, the other day, Juno, Pallas, and Venus were of- 
fered; he has made his choice, upon you he bestows the apple; come 
to receive it tomorrow at Portici, I shall be there alone; your re- 
fusal would disappoint :ne cruelly and gain you nothing. I shall 
therefore expect you.” 

A communication so despotic, so laconic, deserved the most 
straightforward reply; | made it verbally, and contented myself 
with assuring the page boy that I would be punctual. Once the mes- 
senger has left, I fly to tell my sisters this piece of good news. All 
three thoroughly determined to banish the least suspicion of envy 
from our relations, to adopt a lightsome attitude toward human 
folly, to wring profit fro it, to laugh at it—Olympia and Clairwil 
besought me not to miss the adventure. And arrayed like that very 
goddess who had merited the apple, I spring into a coach-and-six 
which, a few minutes later, brings me to the gate of the royal castle, 
renowned for the ruins of Herculaneum upon which it stands. 
Mysteriously introduced into this house’s most obscure apartments, 
I at last come to the King, nonchalantly reposing in a boudoir. 

‘My choice has created jealousies, naturally?” the fool says, 
speaking French with a villainous accent. 

“No, Sire,” I answer him, “‘my sisters noted this preference 
with equanimity, as did I, no more touched, in honor, not to be 


14 The reader must think back to the period at which this was written.

included therein than am I by the vast honor you perhaps fancy 
it does me.” 

He stares. “A singular reply, bless my soul.” 

“Ah, though full aware that to please kings one must always 
flatter them, I, who in them perceive nought but ordinary mortals, 
never speak to them save it be to tell them the truth.” 

“But if that truth is harsh ?”’ 

“You wonder why they deserve to hear it? But why should 
they suppose themselves less entitled than other men to the naked 
truth? Because they have a yet greater need of it?” 

“They dread it more.” 

“Tush. Let them then behave justly, let them renounce an 
empty pride out of which they strive to enslave men, and a liking 
for truth will replace their fear of it.” 

“But, Madame, such speeches—”’ 

“They startle you, Ferdinand, I see it. You doubtless thought 
that, flattered by your choice, I was going to approach you on my 
hands and knees; that I was going to bow down before you, serve 
you. No; a Frenchwoman, the pride that my sex and nationality 
inspire in me lends itself ill to such usages. Ferdinand, if I have 
been willing to grant you the interview you solicited, ’tis because 
I consider myself perhaps a little better equipped to enlighten you 
regarding your veritable interests. So forget for a moment the 
frivolous pleasures you promised yourself with an ordinary woman, 
and listen to one who knows you well, who knows your kingdom 
still better, and who can, concerning these subjects, speak to you 
in a manner your courtesans do not dare.” 

Seeing that the King, slackjawed from surprise, bewildered, 
was paying all possible attention to me, 1 addressed him thus: 

“My friend, you will permit me to dispense with those vain- 
glorious nicknames and titles which tell only of the impertinence 
in him who receives them and of the shameless baseness in him 
who mouths them; my friend, I say, I have lately been examining 
your nation with utmost care, and have found it extremely difficult 
to put my finger upon its genius; I have been studying it since com- 
ing to Naples, and I confess I as yet see nothing there. Neverthe- 
less, I think I have detected the reason for the trouble I have been 
having. Your people have lost track of their origins; successive mis- 


928 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fortunes, foreign domination after foreign domination, have left 
them limp, spineless, habituated to a slavery which has drained 
them of their one-time energy, rendered them unrecognizable. This 
nation, which sought liberators for so long, managed every time, 
through incredible blunclering, to end up with another master. A 
great lesson for any people eager to break their shackles: let them 
learn from the Neapolitans’ example that success lies not in im- 
ploring protectors, but in shattering the throne and laying low the 
tyrants who sit upon it. Every other people has used the Neapoli- 
tans to establish a power; they alone have remained weak-willed 
and listless. One seeks for the genius of the Neapolitans, and as in 
the case of every population accustomed to slavery, one encounters 
nothing but the genius o: their sovereign. Be sure of it, Ferdinand, 
the faults I perceive in your nation are not so much hers as your 
own. But something more surprising still: the very excellence of 
your people’s territory is perhaps the unique cause of their poverty: 
a more barren soil, a climate less mild, and the Neapolitans would 
have been forced to be industrious, and from meeting the challenge 
of adverse conditions they would have developed the vigor that 
eludes them owing to the fertility of their land. Thus it is that this 
fine country, with the advantages of a meridional location, is in- 
habited by a people who would be better off in the north. 

‘Since coming into your States I have looked everywhere for 
your kingdom, and all I discover is your city: a pit that swallows 
up all the wealth of the nation, and thereby impoverishes it. I cast 
an eye about this capital, what do I see? Everything ostentation 
and opulence can displav of the most magnificent, and that cheek 
to jowl with the most afflicting evidence of indigence and idleness. 
On the one hand, noblemen living like kings; on the other, citizens 
in a worse case than serfs. And the vice of inequality everywhere, 
that all-destroying poiscn; and all the more difficult to root out, 
since the political order is built upon the enormous disparity be- 
tween classes. Hereabouts, you either see men who own whole 
provinces or else drudges without even an acre; and between these 
two extremes, nothing. As a result, everything divides each man 
from his fellow. If these rich folk had some virtues, at least—but 
they arouse my pity, they make a dazzling show of themselves and 
possess none of the qualities which offset the ridiculous in such dis- 


Juliette @& 929 


plays; they are proud without being urbane, tyrants without civility, 
magnificently appareled without elegance, libertines without any 
subtlety. In my opinion, they all resemble your Vesuvius: so many 
beauties before which one recoils. All their means for distinguishing 
themselves boil down to subsidizing convents and keeping actresses, 
to feeding horses, valets, and hounds. 

“When in the course of my considerations I came upon your 
people’s formal refusal to adopt the tribunal of the Inquisition, I 
was impressed favorably; yet, I realized, this did not make the 
Neapolitans one whit less weak, although they did something that 
calls for strength. 

“Your clergy is accused of having accumulated great wealth. 
In my eyes, this is not something to blame them for: their greed, 
matching that of the nation’s rulers, redresses the balance some- 
what: the latter throw money about, the priests hoard it. When 
the day comes to seize the kingdom’s treasures, one will at least 
know where they are to be found.” 

“Closely analyzing your nation, I see that it contains but three 
estates, all three of them either useless or poverty-ridden: the 
people surely belong to that latter class, the priests and courtesans 
form the other two. One of the major shortcomings from which 
this little empire of yours suffers, my friend, is that in it there 
exists but one power to which everything else is subsidiary: the 
King, here, is the State; the minister is the government. As a con- 
sequence, no possible emulation save that to which the sovereign 
or the sovereign’s agent gives rise—what greater flaw could any 
system have? 

“Though Nature lavishes much upon your people, their cir- 
cumstances are strait. But this is not the effect of their laziness; this 
general paralysis has its source in your policy which, from main- 


15 It has not come out so well with those peoples who, through a mistaken im- 
pulse of philosophy, thought they were destroying superstition when they pillaged its 
altars. What remains to them now? The same prejudice, and no more gold. The 
ninnies! Seeing not by what hand they were being manipulated, they fancied they 
were abolishing worship, and actually lent it strength; mean instruments of the 
rascals directing them, the poor fools fancied they were serving Reason, when they 
were only fattening swine. Religious revolutions are prepared by clever writings, by 
instruction, and end with the total extinction not of the baubles of religious stupidity, 
but of the knaves who preach and foment it. 


930 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


taining the people in dependence, shuts them out from wealth; 
their ills are thus rendered beyond remedy, and the political state 
is in a situation no less grave than the civil government, since it 
must seek its strength in its very weakness. Your apprehensiveness, 
Ferdinand, lest someone discover the things I have been telling 
you leads you to exile a-ts and talents from your realm. You fear 
the powerful eye of gerius, that is why you encourage ignorance. 
Tis opium you feed your people, so that, drugged, they do not 
feel their hurts, inflicted by you. And that is why where you reign 
no establishments are to be found giving great men to the home- 
land; the rewards due knowledge are unknown here, and as there 
is neither honor nor prof t in being wise, nobody seeks after wisdom. 

“T have studied your civil laws, they are good, but poorly en- 
forced, and as a result they sink into ever further decay. And the 
consequences thereof? A man prefers to live amidst their corrup- 
tion rather than plead for their reform, because he fears, and with 
reason, that this reform will engender infinitely more abuses than 
it will do away with; things are left as they are. Nevertheless, 
everything goes askew and awry, and as a career in government 
has no more attractions than one in the arts, nobody involves him- 
self in public affairs; anc! for all this compensation is offered in the 
form of luxury, of frivo.ity, of entertainments. So it is that among 
you a taste for trivial things replaces a taste for great ones, that 
the time which ought to be devoted to the latter is frittered away 
on futilities, and that you will be subjugated sooner or later and 
again and again by any foe who bothers to make the effort. 

“In view of its situation, your State needs a fleet for its de- 
fense. I have seen a few soldiers in your country, but not one war- 
ship. With this insouciance, with this unpardonable apathy, your 
nation foregoes the possibility of becoming the sea power which 
by all rights it ought to be, and as your forces on the land do not 
make up for your lack cof a navy, you wil! finish by amounting to 
nothing. Expanding nations will laugh at you, and if ever a revolu- 
tion were to regenerate some one or other among them, you will 
be rightly deprived of the honor of constituting a weight on the 
scales. Anyone at all could make you tremble, even the Pope if he 
cared to bestir himself. 

“Well, Ferdinand! It is not worth dominating a nation if one 


Juliette 931 


rules it in such a way. And do you think a sovereign, even a despot, 
can be happy when his people do not flourish ? Where are the eco- 
nomic principles in your State? I have searched for them high and 
low, and uncovered none anywhere. Are you promoting agricul- 
ture? Encouraging the growth of population? Protecting trade? 
Aiding the arts? Not only is there no sign hereabouts of anything 
others are doing elsewhere, but everything I see points in the op- 
posite direction. The outcome of it all? Your pallid monarchy 
languishes in indigence; you yourself become a nullity in the concert 
of European powers; your downfall is not far off. 

“Shall I examine your city from the inside? Shall I analyze 
its manners? Nowhere do I perceive those simple virtues that pro- 
vide the bedrock to society. Company is kept out of snobbery, 
friendship goes on through habit, marriage is determined by ma- 
terial need; and as vanity is foremost among the Neapolitans’ 
vices, a fault they acquired from the Spanish under whose heel they 
lived for so long; as, I say, pride is a vice inherent in your nation, 
its members prefer to avoid close scrutiny for fear lest the face of 
horror appear once the mask is removed. Your aristocracy, igno- 
rant and stupid as it is everywhere else, brings disorder to its peak 
by placing its trust in lawyers, melancholy and dangerous breed 
swollen now to such ridiculous proportions there is practically no 
justice anymore. The little there is costs its weight in gold; and 
among all the countries I have visited, this is perhaps the only one 
where I have seen more wit exercised absolving a guilty man than 
is elsewhere devoted to justifying an innocent. 

“IT had imagined your court would offer me some ideas of 
polite behavior and gallantry, I see it contains nothing but boors 
or imbeciles. Weary of monarchical vices, I had the hope, in com- 
ing here, of finding a few antique virtues: instead, in your govern- 
ment I discover only the result of all the disorders to be encoun- 
tered in the various kingdoms of Europe. Each individual, in your 
country, seeks to appear somehow larger than life-size; and as 
nobody has the qualities requisite to acquiring wealth, fraud is 
substituted for them; dishonesty thus becomes ingrained, congeni- 
tal, and foreigners can no longer have confidence in a nation that 
has none in itself. 

‘After having glanced at the nobility, I take a look at your 


932 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


common people. Without exception, I find them uncouth, stupid, 
indolent, thieving, bloodthirsty, insolent, and possessing not a single 
virtue to redeem any of those vices. 

“Do I wish, joining the two halves of the picture together, to 
contemplate this society as a whole? J behold a confusion of eco- 
nomic conditions; the citizen lacking the necessities of life taken 
up with useless activities; each man serving as amusement or spec- 
tacle to some other; indigence itself putting on grandiose airs that 
are the more revolting since, while horses draw its carriages, its 
cupboard at home is bare. One of the disastrous effects of the 
Neapolitans’ taste for luxury is that, in order to have a coach and 
valets, three out of four of the best households avoid marrying 
their daughters; this frightful practice extends throughout all 
classes. Again, what happens? The population diminishes in direct 
proportion to the increase of luxury; and the State gradually sinks, 
the brighter the sheen it acquires by these vile means. 

“But it is in your weddings and in your takings of the veil 
especially that this wastefulness becomes as preposterous as it is 
cruel. In the first case, you raid the luckless bride’s dowry in order 
to embellish her for a day; in the second, you'd have enough to find 
her a husband if you did not spend it upon the ludicrous ceremony 
which is to deprive her of one for the rest of her life. 

“Particularly, Ferdinand, it is that although your subjects are 
poor, you are rich. And you would be a great deal richer had your 
predecessors not sold the State piecemeal for great sums of silver. 
A State that has reciprocal commercial interests can bargain past 
rainy days; but a people who borrows from anybody and lends to 
nobody, a people who, in the article of trade, plays a lone hand 
against the whole of Europe, must inevitably become poor. Such 
is the history of your nation, my dear prince; all the others, having 
industry, make you pay the price for their goods, and your industry, 
practically at a standstill, wins you no customers. 

“The amusing thing is that your arts reflect the puffed-up 
character of your people. Not a city on earth surpasses yours in 
operatic decorations; Naples is all tinsel and frippery, like its 
population. Medicine, surgery, poetry, astronomy are still in the 
dark ages here; but your dancers are excellent; and nowhere do we 
have such droll Scaramouches. In other countries they go to all 


Juliette Ys 933 


sorts of lengths to become rich; all alone, the Neapolitan exerts 
himself only to look rich: his heart is less set on owning a large 
fortune than in persuading others he enjoys one, and his search is 
far less for opulence than for outward signs thereof. That is the 
reason why in this country there are so many people stinting them- 
selves on essentials in order to have the superfluous. Meanness 
reigns at the most lavish banquets; culinary refinements are un- 
known; apart from your macaroni, what do they eat here that’s 
good? Nothing: your countrymen are absolutely innocent of the 
voluptuous art of stimulating every passion by the delicious means 
of a subtle cuisine Everything is subordinated to the absurd pleas- 
ure of having a handsome carriage, expensive livery; along with 
the pomp and magnificence of modern times you have retained the 
frugality of the ancients—the contrast is unsightly. Your women 
are imperious and dirty, demanding and shrewish, without style 
and without conversation. In other climates, their commerce, 
though it spoils the heart, may at least improve the mind; here, 
the men do not even derive that latter advantage from them; the | 
vices contracted in their society are mitigated by nothing; with 
them it’s all loss, never any gain. | 

“However, one must be fair: there are some positive things to 
be said about your people. There is a basic goodness in them; the 
Neapolitan is quick-tempered, irascible, brusque, but his ill-humor 
doesn’t last, and his heart, grievances once forgotten, is warm and | 
not without virtues. Almost all the crimes committed here are | 
rather the products of a thoughtless first impulse than of premedi- | 
tation, that this people is not spiteful is proven by the great num- 
ber of the Neapolitans, which is maintained without police. This | 
people loves you, Ferdinand: show your subjects you love them in | 
return, be capable of a great sacrifice. Christine, Queen of Sweden, | 
abjured her crown through philosophy: break your scepter out of | 
benevolence, relinquish the reins of a so badly organized govern-| 
ment that enriches nobody but you. Remind yourself that kings are | 
nothing in today’s world, the common masses everything. Leave to | 
this people the task of overhauling and refitting a ship which will | 
never sail very far with you at its helm; let Naples live as a Re-| 
public: to the extent this race, and I have studied it well, makes for | 
bad slaves, it will produce good «citizens; liberate its energy by de- |

livering it from the shackles of your power, that will be to accom- 
plish two meritorious acts at one stroke: there will be a tyrant the 
less on the face of Europe, and one nation the more to admire 
there.” 

Ferdinand, who had listened to me with his best attention, 
asked, when I had finished, whether all Frenchwomen thus rea- 
soned about politics. 

“No,” I replied, “and more’s the pity: the majority of them 
are better analysts of ruffles and flounces than of the structure of 
kingdoms: they weep when oppressed, they are insolent once un- 
chained. As for me, frivolity is not my vice; I’ not say the same 
for libertinage. ... I am: excessively addicted to it. But the pleasure 
of fucking does not blind me to the point of being unable to discuss 
the interests of the world’s populations. In strongly made souls the 
passions’ torch lights a Minerva as well as a Venus; burning with 
the latter’s fire, I fuck ‘ike your sister-in-law; illuminated by the 
rays of the former, I think and discourse like Hobbes and Montes- 
quieu. Is it then, in your opinion, such a difficult thing to manage, 
an empire? So assure tie people’s welfare that nobody can envy 
you yours; then dedicate yourself unreservedly to this latter, which 
you can safely do, since human beings cease to be observant or rest- 
less when they are happy—that, it seems to me, is the whole secret, 
and I would have put it into practice long ago had I had, like you, 
the power and the foolishness to rule a nation. But mark you well, 
my friend, it is not despotism I forbid you, I am too familiar with 
its charms to deny it to vou; I simply advise the suppression or the 
rectification of whatever jeopardizes or interferes with the main- 
tenance of this despotism, if it is upon the throne you choose to 
stay. Render every sentient being happy if you wish to be so your- 
self; for the moment the crowd’s enjoyments pale, be very certain 
of it, Ferdinand, the crowd will spoil your pleasures in its turn.” 

“And by what means?” 

“Institute the broadest freedom of thought, of belief, and of 
conduct. Do away with moral impediments: the man with an erec- 
tion wishes to act as freely as a cat or dog. If, as is done in France, 
you are going to appoint for him the altar upon which he must shed 
his fuck, employing absurdities to bend him under the yoke of a

puerile morality, he will repay you in kind and with good measure. 
Such irons, forged to your order by pedants and priests, will be 
yours to wear ere long, and it may be that you'll carry them to the 
scaffold, for your erstwhile victim will have his revenge.”’”” 

“Your opinion, then, is that there must be no moral standards 
under a government?” 

“None save those inspired by Nature. You will always render 
the human animal unhappy when you seek to subject him to any 
others. To him who has suffered the outrage leave the problem of 
obtaining redress, he will handle the business better than do your 
laws, for his interests are more closely involved; your laws, more- 
over, are frequently eluded, but the object of just revenge rarely 
escapes.” 

“Faith, all that is quite beyond me,” the great simpleton con- 
fessed with a sigh. “I fuck, I eat macaroni without cooks, I build 
houses without architects. I collect medallions without antiquarians, 
I play at billiards like a lackey, I exercise. my cadets like a drill- 
sergeant; but I don’t talk politics, religion, ethics, or government, 
because I know nothing about any of them.” 

“And your kingdom ?” 

“Oh, it gets along, it gets along as best it can. Think you then 
that to be king one has to be so very wise?” 

“Apparently not, for I must take you as proof,” I replied. 
“But that is not enough to convince me that a leader of men can 
dispense with reason and philosophy, nor that, deprived of the one 
and the other, a prince like you can avoid blunders which will one 
fine day see your subjects up in arms and ridding themselves of an 
idiotic master. And this will come very shortly to pass unless you 
take every possible measure to prevent it.” 

“TI have cannons, fortresses.” 

‘“Who mans them ?” 

“My people.” 

‘When they weary of you, they'll turn the guns against your 
castle, take your fortresses and perhaps, who knows, drag you in 
the mire.” 


17It has been remarked that there were never so many police regulations, re- 
strictive codes governing morals, etc., as during the closing years of the reigns of 
Charles I and of Louis XVI. 


936 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“You terrify me, Madame! What must I do?” 

“TI have told you. Imitate the experienced horseman: rather 
than shorten the bit when the charger rears, go softly with him, 
loosen the reins, let hir. have his head. Nature, disseminating peo- 
ples over all the surface of the globe, gave them all the intelligence 
necessary to run their affairs; but it was only in a moment of wrath 
she suggested the idea of saddling themselves with kings. These are 
to the body politic as a doctor is to the physical body: you may call 
him when you are ill, you must show him to the door once health 
returns, else he’ll prolong the malady so as to be of eternal aid, 
and while pretending to cure, he'll bide with you to the grave.”™* 

“Juliette, you reason forcefully, I like your conversation, but 

. . confound it all, you overawe me; you have more wit than I.” 

“Which is to credit me with more than none at all. Never 
mind, Sire, since my wit frightens you, reason will yield for a 
moment to your pleasures. Come, what do you desire?” 

“It is said that you have the world’s prettiest body, Juliette, 
I should like to see it. This, perhaps, is not quite the language I 
ought to be employing, considering the manners you displayed at 
the time of your arriva. in our midst; but I am not taken in by 
facades, my dear. I have informed myself about your sisters and 
you; although exceedingly rich, you are, beyond any doubt, thor- 
oughgoing whores, the three of you.” 

“Your information is highly inexact, fair my Lord,” I replied 
with vivacity, “‘your spies resemble your ministers, they steal your 
money without giving you service in return. You are in error; but 
no matter. For my part, [ have no inclination to act the vestal. The 
question is merely one of coming to terms. I shall not make the 
capitulation any harder for you than it was for your brother-in-law, 
that little Duke of Tuscany. Now listen to me. While you are mis- 
taken in considering us whores, if we are not so in fact, yet it is a 
certainty that for wickedness and corruption we cannot be easily 
outdone; you shall have the three of us, if you like.” 

“Truly,” said the prince, “nothing pleases me more than to 
string beads an entire family at a time.” 

‘Well, you shall have that satisfaction, and we merely ask, in 


18 Not until the fatherland was in danger did the Romans name a dictator.

exchange, that you defray the expenses we shall be incurring in 
Naples over the coming six months, that you pay our debts if we 
contract any, and that you guarantee our total immunity, whatever 
may be the pranks we indulge in.” 

“Pranks?” Ferdinand wondered. “What kind of pranks?” 

“Numerous, violent, beyond anything imaginable: my sisters 
and I do not stint ourselves where it is a question of crime, we com- 
mit all sorts and we do not wish to be punished for any of them.” 

“Granted,” Ferdinand replied; “but endeavor to keep your 
depradations from becoming unduly noticed, and let neither my 
government nor my person become the target of your attacks.” 

“No, no,” I assured him, “they'd not amuse us. Good or bad, . 
we leave regimes as they are; and to the underlying people we 
leave the task of settling matters with their kings.” 

“All right,” said Ferdinand, ‘“‘we can now discuss pleasures.” 

“Did you not tell me you wanted to enjoy my sisters too?” 

“Yes, but a beginning must be made somewhere. Let us 
therefore start with you.” And, guiding me into an adjoining 
chamber, “Juliette,” the Neapolitan went on, showing me a woman 
of twenty-seven or twenty-eight years, almost naked and lying upon 
a couch in an alcove paneled with mirrors, ‘‘they are this lady’s pas- 
sions no less than mine that you shall have to satisfy.” 

“Who is this person ?” 

“My wife.” 

“Ah, ’tis you, Charlotte,” I say, “to he sure. I know you 
through your reputation: as whorish as your sisters, report has it, 
however, that you pay better. We shall see.” 

“Juliette,” Ferdinand interjected, “if you wish to have me 
favor your desires, you must, toward the Queen, show utmost 
consideration.” 

“All she has to do is say what she wants: the resources of 
lewdness, I possess them every one, there are none I am not ready 
to employ.” 

And that was when Charlotte of Lorraine, throwing her arms 
around my neck, gave me to understand, by a thousand kisses, how 
alive she already was to the pleasures I promised her. Ceremony 
was laid aside: Ferdinand undressed us both. Then, there having 
been fetched in a page boy of same fifteen years, a delight to be- 


938 ce THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


hold, whose clothes the King also removed, Charlotte and I frigged 
each other upon the couch while, from where he had a clear view 
of our doings, Ferdinand, polluted by the page, kissed the boy’s 
mouth ardently, at the same time fingering his behind. 

Oh, my friends! What a woman that Charlotte was! Impu- 
dicity had established its hearth in that royal whore’s cunt; Char- 
lotte, her thighs entwined with mine, rubbed her clitoris against 
my clitoris, frenziedly; her hands roved over my buttocks; one of 
her fingers tickled my asshole; her tongue, stuck far into my mouth, 
lapped thirstily at my saliva; the wench was all ablaze, fuck fairly 
leaked from her pores. ] engage her to change positions; her head 
slips between my thighs, mine between hers, and we suck altogether 
at our ease. Oh, how willingly she repays me for what I yield to 
her mouth; if my cunt floods her throat with sperm, her frequent 
ejaculations send rivers of delight into mine. When we had shed 
our fuck to the last drop she besought me to piss into her mouth; 
I asked the same of her, we poured urine into each other, swallow- 
ing it as it flowed. 

Charlotte is beautiful, her skin is very white, her breasts high 
and firm, her buttocks admirable, her thighs of marvelous propor- 
tion; ’tis plain that she has much fucked and in every conceivable 
manner, but she is well preserved all the same, and her openings 
are still very narrow.” 

‘Oh, my love,” I sa‘d to her, truly moved by her charms, “‘let 
us exchange more serious blows.”’ 

“Here is what you need for that,” spoke up the King, tossing 
us a pair of dildoes. Ancl having each donned that equipment, we 
set to smiting each other with greatest energy. At one point in our 
capers my ass was direct y in front of Ferdinand; he examines it, 
covets it, covers it with the most heated kisses. 

“Stand where you are for a moment and steady your move- 
ments,” he says to me, “I mean to embugger you while you fuck 
my wife. You, Zerbi, frig my behind.” 

The scene lasts several instants, at the end of which the prince, 
having his wife exchange places with me, buggers her while she 
fucks me; a moment later, he has her sodomized by the youth, I 


18 This sketch was done from nature. 


Juliette & 939 


tongue her cunt, and he at last discharges into the bowels of the 
page who is cuckolding him. 

After a brief interval of rest employed in kissing, in fondling 
one another, we started in anew. Ferdinand fitted himself into my 
ass, he sucked Zerbi’s, had the boy shit into his mouth, and his wife 
beat him; a minute of this and he retired from my bum, took the 
switches and beat the three of us rather severely; the Queen then 
wielded them upon my hindquarters, flogging was one of her pas- 
sions, she kept at it until my blood flowed; she sucked the page’s 
prick while her husband ass-fucked her and she kneaded my behind. 
A little while later we surrounded Ferdinand, I sucked him, his 
wife socratized him, palpated his balls, and the page, straddling 
his chest, gave the King of Naples his asshole to lick; he got up 
from that with a fierce erection. 

“I don’t know why we shouldn’t wring that little bugger’s 
neck,” said he, collaring his page and squeezing shrill screams 
from him. 

“Hang him,” said Charlotte. 

“Dear girl,” said I, kissing that charming person, “would you 
have a fondness for cruelties too? Ah, I adore you, if ’tis so. Yes, 
I can see it, you would be capable of that trick of the Chinese em- 
press, who fed her goldfish on the genitals of the children of the 

oor.” 
j “Oh yes, I shall imitate that horror when called upon; and 
I am capable of worse yet. Infamies, Ferdinand, let’s perform in- 
famies, this woman is delightful, she has wit, character, imagina- 
tion; I believe she shares our tastes. Here, my friend, be Zerbi’s 
executioner, and let us all remember that an individual’s destruction 
is the most potent stimulant one can add to the charms of sensual 
debauchery. Hang Zerbi, dear husband, hang him short; Juliette 
will masturbate me while we observe the operation from close on.” 

It is carried out: Ferdinand hangs the page up with such skill, 
dispatch, and violence that the boy expires before we have time to 
get properly started. 

“Alas,” Charlotte grumbles, ‘‘unlucky creature that I am, I 
postponed my spasm until I could watch him die. Never mind, 
Ferdinand, cut him down; dead as he is, guide his hand, I want to 


be frigged by it.” 


940 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“No,” says the King, “Juliette will undertake that chore; 
I shall embugger the cadaver in the meantime; they claim there is 
nothing better in the world, I must try it. Oh, sweet fuck !’” he cries, 
once lodged in that ass, ‘‘this pleasure is everything it is reputed to 
be. What a grip to a dead anus! ’Tis divine.” 

The scene goes forward; Zerbi does not come back to life, 
but his slayers die of pleasure. Charlotte, for one last discharge 
stretched out naked upon the page’s already cold body, and while 
her husband frigged her, she had me shit in her mouth. Four thou- 
sand ounces” was my fee, and we separated with the promise to 
meet together soon in more numerous company. 

Once home again, | tell my sisters about his Sicilian Majesty’s 
odd tastes. 

“Wonderful, is it not,” Clairwil remarked, “always to find 
such passions lodged in the brains of those whom Nature has made 
outstanding through the gift of intelligence, wealth, or authority.” 

“It strikes me as perfectly understandable,” said Olympia, 
whom we called by no other name, fearing lest her real one be 
recognized, ‘‘no, I tell you, I know of nothing more natural than 
that the most refined forms of pleasure-seeking be conceived by 
those endowed with the finest powers of discernment, or by those 
whom despotism or the favors of fortune place on a superior level. 
A man with much intellect, much power, or much money cannot pos- 
sibly amuse himself the way everybody else does. Now, if he re- 
fines his pleasures he must inevitably arrive at murder, for murder 
is the ultimate excess of pleasure: voluptuousness dictates it, mur- 
der is a branch of erotic activity, one of its extravagances. The 
human being reaches the final paroxysm of delight only through an 
access of rage; he thunders, he swears, he loses all sense of pro- 
portion, all self-control, at this crucial moment he manifests all the 
symptoms of brutality; another step, and he is barbaric; yet an- 
other, and he has killed; the more intelligent he is, the more he will 
refine his gestures and proceedings. One obstacle will nevertheless 
continue to impede him, he will fear either the extreme costliness 
of his pleasures, or the law; deliver him from these silly terrors 
by means of gold or authority, and you have launched him into a 
career of crime, because impunity reassures him, and because noth-

ing daunts a man when along with the mind capable of conceiving 
anything there are combined the means to undertake everything.” 

“Well,” said I to my friends, ‘‘we are all three in that enviable 
case; for over and above the immense wealth we possess, Ferdinand 
guarantees us the most entire impunity.” 

“Fuck,” said Clairwil, “how that agreeable certitude inflames 
my passions! .. .”” And the hussy drew up her skirts, spread her 
legs, inserted her fingers between her labia and offered us a ver- 
milion and panting cunt which seemed to be calling all the pricks 
in Naples to combat. 

“I hear the engines are superb in these parts,” she went on, | 
‘we must make some arrangements with Sbrigani in order not to 
miss any.” 

“T finished attending to all that yesterday,” that charming man | 
declared, “I have put twelve purveyors into the field and shall see 
to it that two dozen pretty lads between the ages of eighteen and | 
twenty-five are regularly presented to you every morning; I shall | 
also see to the verifications; if in spite of my rigorous specifications | 
any shoddy specimens happened to be included in the deliveries, | 
they would be weeded out, rejected—” 

“What were the sizes you ordered?” asked Clairwil, whom | 
Raimonde was now frigging. | 

“You will never be given anything under six inches in circum- | 
ference by eight in length.” | 

‘For shame, Sbrigani! Those dimensions may be good for 
Paris, but in Naples, where monsters grow. ... For my part, I do | 
not intend to accept anything less than eight inches around and | 
a foot long.” 

“Neither shall we,” Olympia and I declared, almost simulta- | 
neously; ‘“‘we may end up with fewer, but we shall have better—” ] 

“Fewer!” cried Clairwil. “I see no reason to reduce the num- © 
ber. To the contrary, in addition to quality I demand quantity. | 
Therefore, Sbrigani, I shall ask you to furnish us thirty men each | 
morning, and with the proportions I cited a moment ago: that will | 
give us ten apiece. Let’s say we get three fuckings out of each— 
that, surely, is not asking too much; and which is the one among us 
who is unable to ride ten mounts into the ground before drinking | 
her breakfast chocolate? She who speaks assures you that getting | 


942 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


off to an early start will not prevent her from accomplishing some 
startling little infamies in the course of the day; indeed, ’tis only 
by a good deal of fucking one puts oneself in proper fucking form; 
and for what else but to fuck did Nature create us?” 

And, pronouncing tiiese last words, the spirited creature dis- 
charged where she lay in Raimonde’s arms. 

“While waiting for me to fill your prescription,” said Sbrigani, 
“see whether these six valets please you; I believe they excéed the 
measurements you have ust indicated.” 

Thereupon appeared six great strapping fellows nearly six 
feet tall, half-naked, and prick in fist. 

“Bloody-fuck,” exclaimed Clairwil, her skirts still gathered 
up around her waist, ‘what members I see. Here, let me heft 
them”—but her two hands were not enough to encircle any of 
those bludgeons—-; “‘they are bulky, my friends. Take your choice; 
these are the two I am keeping.” 

“One moment!” cautioned Sbrigani. “Permit me to regulate 
your pleasures, they will be better directed by someone who is calm 
than by you, fuck-blinded already.” 

“He’s right, he’s right,’ Clairwil assented, nevertheless pull- 
ing off her clothes in great haste, ‘let him arrange, let him organ- 
ize. While he does, I shall be getting myself ready.” 

“Clairwil, you shall begin,” said Sbrigani, “you seem in the 
greatest hurry.” 

“That is only too true,” our companion confessed, ‘I don’t 
know what it is about the air in this city, but it makes me more 
libertine than ever.” 

“Filled with nitrous, sulphorous, and bituminous particles,” I 
replied, “it must necessarily irritate the nerves and produce a 
greater than ordinary corimotion in the animal spirits. I too feel 
that I am going to behave atrociously here in Naples.” 

“Although I ought to be more accustomed to it than you,” 
said Olympia, ‘‘Naples and my native city lying not very far apart, 
even so, like you, I am dreadfully overwrought in this atmosphere.” 

“Then make the most of it,” said Sbrigani, “fall to, whores, 
and count upon me to lend a helping hand. This then,” he contin- 
ued, ‘‘is the arrangement I recommend for the opening scene: Clair- 


’

wil, I repeat, will begin; though burning to be fucked, I want her 
sincerely to desire the engine that is to pierce her. Juliette, take this 
handsome prick your friend has already chosen, frig it in the near 
vicinity of her cunt, rub her clitoris with the tip, but don’t drive it 
in. You, Olympia, lightly tickle the entrance to the patient’s cunt; 
tease it, warm it, infuriate it, and when rage flames in her eyes, 
we'll satisfy her, but she must be lying in one of these young gentle- 
men’s arms: the while he supports her, the brave fellow must frig 
her asshole with one hand, her nipples with the other, and he must 
kiss her in the meantime, lewdly. Further to arouse our friend’s 
senses, we shall have her, with either hand, stuff a prick into Rai- 
monde’s cunt and into Elise’s, where they will merely gather heat 
for a moment; the two remaining youths will encunt the two of you 
before Clairwil’s eyes, to complete the tumult we wish to create in 
her soul.” 

Indeed, five minutes of this was all the rascal could stand; she 
foams at the mouth, she curses, she raves, and seeing that it is be- 
coming impossible to defer satisfying her any longer, the six valets, 
in the space of less than an hour, relay one another atop her body 
and almost kill her with pleasure. Directly it emerged from our 
friend’s cunt, Olympia and I would worry and squeeze each prick; 
Elise and Raimonde frigged us, flogged us, titillated us, licked us. 
Sbrigani orchestrated all these movements, and we discharged like 
fieldpieces. Every manner of fucking, every species of debauchery, 
all imaginable refinements were put into practice; among them, the 
one we employed the most frequently and to best purpose was to 
receive three pricks simultaneously, two in the cunt, one in the ass. 
Few people realize the pleasure this can give, with adroit fuckers; 
there were several times when everybody forgathered upon a 
single woman. Thrice did I withstand the weight of that general 
assault. I was lying upon one man who was embuggering me; Elise, 
squatting over my face, gave me her pretty little cunt to suck; an- 
other man embuggered her above me, while frigging my cunt; and 
‘Raimonde was stimulating that man’s asshole with her tongue. 
Within reach of my two hands were Olympia to one side, on all 
fours, Clairwil to the other side: I introduced a prick into the 
asshole of each, and each of ‘them sucked a prick belonging to the 


944 <e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fifth and sixth man. The six valets, after having discharged eight 
times each, were finally received without difficulty. It was impossible 
to refuse them admission after such ordeals. 

A week or so after this adventure a courier brought a new in- 
vitation from Ferdinand. who requested all three of us to come to 
visit him at Portici. The King, we saw, had intended that this be 
a far more brilliant scere than the first one. We were led into 
magnificently decorated apartments, deliciously cool despite the 
heat outside. Charlotte, attired like Flora, was awaiting us in the 
company of Prince La R ccia, a’ handsome fop of twenty-four, who 
was the familiar of all the royal couple’s private pleasures. A 
quartet of pretty children, two little girls of ten and eleven, two 
little boys of twelve and thirteen, dressed as the Greeks were wont 
to costume their victims in ancient days, stood still and in respect- 
ful silence at a farther side of the room where the festivities were 
to be celebrated. Clairwil’s noble and majestic figure, the classic 
regularity that distinguished her features although she was no 
longer in the first blush of youth, the excessive libertinage in her 
eyes—the Queen of Naples was impressed by it all. 

“There,” she affirmed, ‘is a beautiful woman indeed.” 

And as with creatures of our libertine temper it is always but 
a single step from encomiums to caresses, the two wenches were 
soon in each other’s arms. La Riccia lays hands on Olympia, and 
I continued to be the King’s favorite. 

‘Before acting in concert,” said Ferdinand, “‘my suggestion is 
that we first move off two at a time, paired as we are, into the 
boudoirs adjoining this rcom. After a few minutes of intimate con- 
versation we shall convene again.” 

Charlotte sets the example; followed by Clairwil and with 
one of the two little female victims in tow, she enclosets herself in 
a boudoir. La Riccia selects one of the little boys and disappears 
with Olympia; to Ferdinand remain two children, one of either 
sex, and he shuts himself up in privacy with them and with me. And 
now the Neapolitan’s heavy-handed, dull-witted libertinage is re- 
vealed in all its energy. But just as a few rays of sunshine will 
sometimes pierce the gloomiest clouds, bringing cheer to mortal 
hearts, so it was that some rather pretty nuances of lubricity made 


Juliette 2 945 


their way through the masses of awkwardness characterizing that 
oaf’s behavior. 

After some brief preparatory horrors in which each of us in- 
dulged individually with the subjects taken along for that purpose, 
we all collected in a superb salon; and there, having heated one 
another’s imaginations with detailed accounts of our late infamies, 
we plunged forthwith into a new ocean of lewd doings, and exe- 
cuted, unrestrictedly, everything that derangement could inspire in 
minds so libertine and mischievous as ours. Physical exhaustion 
alone brought these voluptuous orgies to an end, and we took leave 
of their Highnesses. 

Upon our return we found Sbrigani wounded and in bed. In- 
sults had been pronounced within his hearing, their object had been 
ourselves; the exchange had taken place in a café, a Frenchman 
who claimed to know who we were had called us whores. Although 
in point of fact it would have been hard to say anything truer, 
Sbrigani, out of attachment, had stoutly refused to admit it, and 
for his lies the foolish fellow had got himself two good sword- 
thrusts in the belly. 

After having tended his cuts, our conversation had naturally 
to treat of dueling. 

“Bah, sheer madness,” Clairwil opined, ‘‘to go and risk one’s 
life in single combat with someone who did decidedly wrong us. If 
this man,” our friend continued, asking our leave to put herself 
temporarily in the position of a sex whose functions she was so 
able to perform when called upon, “‘if, I say, this man has been 
essentially disrespectful toward me, how is it that I owe him such 
a favor as to consider him a fit adversary to measure myself 
against? And why must I put myself in a position from which, in- 
jury added to insult, I may emerge hurt, crippled, nay, from which 
I may not emerge alive? After all, I am the one to whom reparation 
is due, and to obtain it, what! I must endanger my life? If I adopt 
another comportment, or, going to fight with this man, since fight 
I absolutely must, I pad my chest and so ensure my safety that my 
opponent is obliged to give all his care to defending himself and 
must renounce any hope of insulting me again, if, I say, I behave 
thus, I shall be called a scoundrel—and the logic that comes forth 


946 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


here, ah, I would be hard put to think of anything that so flies in 
the face of common sense. 

“Let him who has done the insulting arrive naked at the duel- 
ing ground, and let the insulted party come there in armor—that is 
what reason and the laws of good sense demand. The aggressor 
must obviously be placed at a disadvantage: through his acts he 
has, following the customs which prevail everywhere else on earth, 
earned himself assassination at the hands of the person he has 
slighted; hence, in such a situation, the frivolous rules of honor 
can be trimmed down to prescribing simply that the fight you so 
earnestly want take place, but with a prodigious inequality between 
the combatants; and that the offending party, instead of endeavor- 
ing to cause yet further damage, be prevented from concerning 
himself otherwise than with the problems of strict self-defense. For 
what right has he to attack a second time, after what he has al- 
ready done? Our usages, in this article, are atrociously unjust, and 
make us the laughingstock of those other three-quarters of the 
world where they are wise enough to understand that, when you 
are finally driven to the point where you must avenge yourself, you 
should do it without imperiling your life.” 

“Our views upon this matter concur,” I replied to Clairwil, 
“and I, who also hold dueling both absurd and ridiculous, can but 
add to what you have just said. I find it odious that a man go and 
jeopardize his life because of an insult: in such instances, reason 
and Nature dictate only one course to us, which is to dispatch our 
enemy, not to expose ovrselves to being killed by him, when it is 
reparation he owes us. Our forefathers, far wiser than we, fought 
by proxy; champions, in return for a fixed sum, came forward to 
settle the quarrel, and. the might of the stronger made him right: 
that arrangement at least eliminated the unfairness of having to 
undergo risk oneself, ancl although to that usage no end of extrava- 
gance and nonsense attached, it was infinitely less unacceptable than 
the one we observe nowadays. But here is the ludicrous part: the 
professionals who used to fight on behalf of others were generally 
regarded as vile persons: we today have taken their place, and risk 
opprobrium, think of it! if we shun the role of despicable individ- 
uals. What furious inconsistencies are these! Going back to the 
origin of things, we see that, first of all, these champions were 


Juliette 2% 947 


merely hired assassins, such as you still meet with in several cities 
in Spain and Italy, whom the offended man engaged to rid him of 
his enemy, and that, next, to mitigate the kind of murder this 
custom seemed to authorize, the accused was allowed to defend 
himself against the assassin hired to kill him, and to employ an 
assassin of his own, and send him into the lists. Such was dueling 
in its infancy, whose cradle was the wise law permitting any man 
mortal vengeance upon his enemy. That excellent practice has 
given way to license, has been replaced by a stupidity which distorts 
the ancient institution, and which makes common sense shudder. 
And so, let not the man who has an enemy and who has some intelli- 
gence rush off and fence with him on an equal footing, for it is 
perfectly ridiculous to stoop to the level of somebody who has 
lowered himself beneath you. If the offended party must absolutely 
fight, well and good; but let him, in advance, take every precaution 
to avoid sustaining further hurt; and if he wishes to use his head, 
let him use assassination which, as Moliére says, is the safest way. 

‘“‘As regards those who place the point of honor there, I find 
them at least as ridiculous as those who fancy it is to be placed in 
the virtue of their wives; both are barbarous prejudices and do not 
even deserve cool-headed discussion. Honor is a chimera, bred by 
certain human customs and conventions which have never had any- 
thing but absurdity for basis; it is just as false that a man acquire 
honor through assassinating his country’s enemies as it is false that 
he dishonor himself by massacring his compatriots; never can like 
proceedings warrant unlike consequences: if I do well in going forth 
to avenge my nation for the wrongs it has endured, I do better still 
when I avenge myself for those done to me. The State, which re- 
tains in its year-round hire some four or five hundred thousand 
assassins to serve its cause, can neither naturally nor legitimately 
punish me when I, following its example, pay one or two to revenge 
me for the infinitely more real insults I may receive from my ad- 
versary; for, after all, insults addressed to this nation never affect 
its members personally, whereas those I have received decidedly do 
touch me directly; and therein lies a very great difference. But let 
someone dare say such things aloud: society damns him straight 
off for a coward, a poltroon, and the reputation for wit or wisdom 
he has built up over the years is taken away from him in three 


948 -.t THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


minutes by a few miserable whippersnappers, humorless imbeciles 
whom a few prudes, fit to be spanked in the streets, have persuaded 
that there is nothing finer than to risk one’s life when one has the 
right to take the lives of others.” 

“My position on dueling squares wonderfully with yours,” said 
Olympia; “and I do not believe I have given you grounds for mis- 
taking me for one of those mentally deficient women whose opinion 
of a man is dependent upon his willingness, because of an alleged 
slight, to hie himself off to a corner of a meadow and ape the vile 
gladiator. I have only scorn for your bravoes and fellows of fire. 
Combativeness may be delicious in a flunkey or a soldier, good for 
nothing but to be out bloodying noses all day long. But that a man 
of parts, of means... that he abandon his studies, his comfort, to 
go and bare his throat to a bully without any other talent than for 
plying a hanger, and who only insulted him because he knew he 
could run him through. . . . Stake one’s honor upon bravely bring- 
ing such rascals to heel... . What a contemptible fellow one must 
be to venture into such situations! Aye, contemptible: there is base- 
ness in giving others an advantage over oneself, and in risking the 
loss, for one instant and for nothing, of all the amenities, of all the 
favors one has received from Nature. Let us leave this preposter- 
ous merit to the uncouth ages of knight errantry; it is not to play 
the ruffian like a vulgar trooper that gifted people are made, ’tis 
to honor and cultivate the arts, to encourage them, to serve the 
homeland when necessury, and to sacrifice for nothing less the 
blood that flows in thei veins. When a man of that condition has 
an enemy whois his inferior, let him have him assassinated: Nature 
hints at no other means for getting rid of such encumbrances; if he 
has been offended by someone of his own rank, let the two take 
their complaints before a lenient tribunal, set up for such arbitra- 
tions, and let the dispute be judged there: between people of the 
better sort there are no jars that cannot be settled amicably; he 
who is in the wrong must yield, ’tis the law. But blood . . . blood 
shed on account of a stray remark, a jealousy, a quarrel, a per- 
silage, a rebuke: revolting anachronism. The duel was unknown 
until the principles of honor displaced those of vengeance, and, 
consequently, was accepted only once men became civilized. Never 
did Nature grave it in the human heart to seek vengeance for an 


Juliette 2 949 


offense at the risk of one’s life; for it is in no wise just, neither is 
it natural to expose oneself to a second blow merely because one 
has been dealt a first. But it is very equitable, very commendable 
to wash the first away in the blood of the aggressor, without risk- 
ing the loss of any of one’s own, if he is our inferior, and to reach 
a peaceful settlement with him if he is our better or our peer. There 
is no reason to be taken in by the courtesies of women touching 
this matter; it is not bravery in a man they desire, it’s the triumph 
their pride obtains from being able to say that such-and-such a lout 
has carved up rivals for their charms. Nor is it by means of legisla- 
tion this odious usage is to be extirpated; once there are laws there 
is restlessness, opposition, bitterness, and nothing is gained. ’Tis 
beneath ridicule, this lamentable custom must be buried. All women 
must shut the door to a dueling scoundrel; he must be snubbed, 
jeered at, fingers must be pointed when he goes by, at the sight of 
him everyone must cry, ‘Ho, there’s the wretched fellow base 
enough, craven enough, to adopt the vile part of a champion, and 
who was fool enough to think that words which the wind wafts 
away, or cuts which sting but for a moment, were to be acquitted 
at the price of a life, which is to be enjoyed only once. Avoid him; 
he is mad.’”’ 

“Olympia is right,” Clairwil said, “that infamous prejudice 
will be felled in no other way. The objection may be brought for- 
ward, that martial courage will fade out of hearts once its exercise 
ceases. This is quite possible; but I assert that courage is a dupe’s 
virtue, and declare that I prize it very little: I have never seen any- 
one but fools being brave. The second Caesar was a very great man, 
no doubt of it, yet he was afraid of his shadow; Frederick of 
Prussia had a good mind and many talents . . . and had a bout of 
fever whenever the time came to fight. All the illustrious men who 
trembled in their boots, the list would be endless; the Romans even 
revered fear, they raised altars to it. Fear, in short, is in Nature, 
it is born of the innate concern for personal safety, that is, for self- 
preservation, a concern one cannot possibly not have, so deeply is it 
graved in us by the Prime Mover which cast us into the world. To 
disesteem a man because he fears danger, 'tis to hate him for lov- 
ing life. For my part, I protest to you that I will always have the 
highest regard for a man who dreads death; that fact alone proves 


950 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to me that he possesses a brain, an imagination, and a capacity for 
pleasure. The day the whole of Paris castigated La Luzerne for 
having assassinated his adversary on the dueling grounds, that was 
the day I wanted him on my belly: I have belield few more amiable 
mortals, and probably not one whose mind was so attractively 
organized.” 

“Only they are appealing,” I put in; “the higher an individual 
rises above prejudice, the better his mind becomes: the man 
hemmed in by narrow moral principles, necessarily infertile and 
dull, will be as insipid as the maxims he professes, and since with 
the kind of imagination Nature gave us, we will derive nothing 
from his society, we should keep carefully away from him.” 

After a few days, Sbrigani’s condition showed to be much 
improved. 

“He has just fucked me,” Clairwil told me, “I took his pulse 
and I can assure you he is in good health: a throbbing prick is the 
best test of it, and I am still wet with his sperm. . . . So listen to 
me, Juliette,” that incredible personage continued, “‘is it true that 
this man exists in your affections?” 

“He has rendered me many services.” 

“He has only done his duty, you pay him for that. Is your 
soul beginning to open to the mighty principles of gratitude?” 

“No, not yet, upon my honor.” 

“Well, you see, I for one don’t like him, this Sbrigani; what’s 
more, I don’t trust him. That man will end up robbing us.” 

“Say rather that you are weary of him because he gave you 
a good fucking and because you cannot abide a man once he has 
discharged in your cunt.” 

“That one has never fucked me anywhere but in the ass—look 
at it, it’s still leaking what he pumped into it.” 

“Out with it, silly, what are you driving at?” 

“At ridding ourse:ves of that bugger.” 

“Do you forget that he faced death for us?” 

“T certainly do not forget it; and there’s one reason the more 
for detesting him, since his act illustrates stupidity.” 

‘‘Again, what do you propose to do with him?” 

“Tomorrow he will take a last spoonful of medicine; the day 
after that, we bury him.” 


Juliette ® 951 


‘‘Have you anything left of those charming drugs we bought 
together from Durand long ago?” 

“A pinch of this, a pinch of that... . I'd like to have your 
Sbrigani taste a few of them.” 

“Ah, Clairwil, your behavior gets no better with the years, 
you shall always be a great rogue. But what will sister Olympia 
say?” 

“Whatever she pleases. When I have the urge to commit a 
crime, my heart is dominated by something else than concern for 
my reputation.” 

I consented; could I coldly turn my back upon crime? So 
precious to me was anything bearing its stamp that I could not 
refrain from embracing it immediately. I had used that Italian, 
more out of need than from love. Clairwil promised to take care 
of all the details of day-to-day management that had been en- 
trusted to him: Sbrigani’s usefulness came therewith to an end: I 
endorsed his destruction. Olympia made no fuss. On the following 
day, poisoned by Clairwil herself, Sbrigani went off to inform all 
the demons in hell that the wicked spirits existing in a real woman’s 
body are a thousand times more dangerous than those with which 
priests and poets array Tartarus. This operation concluded, we 
set out on a tour of the surroundings of Naples. 


Nowhere in Europe does Nature attain such imposing ex- 
pression, such splendor as in the environs of this city; ‘tis some- 
thing utterly different from that melancholy, uniform beauty of 
the Lombard Plain, which produces a certain torpor in the imagin- 
ation. Here, to the contrary, everything quickens it: the convul- 
sions, the volcanoes, of this everlastingly criminal Nature engender 
restlessness in the spirit, rendering it capable of great deeds and 
tumultuous passions. 

“This,” said I to my two companions, “‘all this is us, and 
virtuous folk resemble those flat stretches of Piedmont countryside 
whose mournful evenness depresses. Carefully examining this ex- 
traordinary region, one feels it may have been all one volcano in 
the past; hardly a spot unmarked by the emblem of upheaval. And 
so this curious Nature is at times given also to unruliness . . . and 


952 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


we are not supposed to imitate her! Crying injustice: the solfataras 
we have been roaming about seem to be the proof of what I say.” 

With the most varied and picturesque scenery unfolding all 
along the way, we reached Pozzuoli. From there can be seen 
Nisida, the pretty little island to which Brutus retired after having 
killed Caesar. What a charming hideaway for the kind of joys we 
cherish; there, one would be as though at the farthest corner of the 
world; the secret horror one would be incited to commit there 
would be curtained from sight by impenetrable screens; and nothing 
needles the imagination, nothing inflames it like silence and mys- 
tery. Off in the distance. beyond the Bay, the headlands of Sorrento 
and Massa can be made out, ruins, noble edifices, flowering hill- 
sides, everything that is able to adorn the most smiling prospect 
and create the most agreeable mood. 

Pozzuoli,”" where we returned for dinner, does not today 
display any trace of its ancient grandeur; but the site remains, it is 
one of the loveliest in the whole Kingdom of Naples. And yet, the 
crass population inhabiting the town is unconscious of its happi- 
ness; excessive idleness serves only to render it more barbarous 
and more insolent. 

As soon as we appeared, a swarm of people crowded up, 
eager to show us the curiosities of the country. 

“Children,” said Olympia, shutting the door after a dozen 
of those rascals had elbowed their way into our chambers, “we do 
not intend to enlist the services of anybody unprovided with an 
outstanding prick. Show us what you have; we shall do our own 
selecting.” 

They all agree to the bargain; we lower breeches, we excite, 
we frig; six are judged worthy of the honors of a spasm, and the 
biggest, that is to say, a funny fellow all in rags and tatters, whose 
leviathan stretched itself thirteen inches in length and filled out to 
nine in circumference, alone obtained, after having fucked us all 
three, the privilege of becoming our cicerone. We dubbed him 
Raphael. 

He took us first to the Temple of Serapis whose impressive 
debris caused us to presume that this structure had once been 


21 Called Puteoli in classical times.—-Tr. 


Juliette & 953 


superb. We visited the neighboring antiquities, and wherever we 
looked, we beheld unequivocal evidence of the magnificence and 
the tastefulness of those Greek and Roman peoples who, after 
having been the light of the world for a brief hour, faded away, 
as shall vanish them who make the world tremble today. 

The remains of a monument to pride and superstition next 
presented themselves to our eyes. Thrasyllus had prophesied that 
Caligula would not wear the purple until he had been from Baiae 
to Puteoli upon a bridge. The emperor had one built of boats for 
a distance of two leagues, and marched across it at the head of his 
army. "Iwas a piece of folly, no doubt, but one of a great man; 
and Caligula’s crimes, which were to make an epoch in history, 
demonstrate, it shall have to be admitted, at once the most. un- 
usual figure and the most impetuous imagination. 

From Caligula’s bridge, Raphael guided us to Cumae; he 
pointed out to us, near the ruins of that town, those of a house 
that belonged to Lucullus. Gazing at them, we reflected upon the 
magnificence of that illustrious person. 

“He is no more... and ere a little, a few months, a few 
years, we too shall have come and gone: the shears of Fate spare 
no one, neither rich nor poor, neither the good man nor the 
wicked. .. . Let us gather flowers while we tread this path whose 
end we reach so soon, and let it at least be of gold and silk the 
Dark Whore spins the thread of our days.” 

We penetrated into the ruins of Cumae, where our attention 
was directed mainly toward the vestiges of the Temple of Apollo 
built by Daedalus when, a refugee from the wrath of Minos, he 
wandered to this city. 

Making our way thence to Baiae, we traversed the little 
locality of Bauli, where the poets situated the Elysian Fields; 
Acheron flows nearby. 

“Let us pay a visit to the underworld,” said Clairwil upon 
seeing those waters; “‘let us go and muse upon the torments of the 
damned, and dwell upon the thought of adding to their sufferings. 
Would that Proserpina’s office were mine. . . . However, provided 
there is earthly woe for me to gaze upon, I shall always be the 
happiest of living women.” 

Eternal springtime reigns in that valley. Amidst the vineyards 


954 + THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


and the poplars are to be seen here and there the burial vaults 
where cinerary urns used to be placed, and Charon doubtless had 
his abode at Misenum. One likes to persuade oneself of such things 
when one has imagination. This brilliant part of our mind vivifies 
everything, and truth, a.ways in arrears of illusion, becomes almost 
of no purpose to him who is able to create and embellish falsehood. 

Close to the village of Bauli the visitor finds the traces of a 
hundred intercommunicating rooms; all this belongs to what they 
call Nero’s Prison: here one could once hear the groans of the 
victims of that villain’s lust and cruelty. 

A little farther along one comes to the marvelous artificial 
lake Marcus Agrippa built for the fleet which ordinarily lay inside 
the bight of Cape Misznum. This cape forms a sheltered haven 
whose importance was recognized by the Roman admirals. It was 
there Pliny’s ships were anchored when Vesuvius’ eruption cost 
him his life. Some vestizes provide clues to this ancient city’s con- 
siderable size. From there you go down to Bauli, which boasts the 
tomb of Agrippina. "T'was off the shore of this town that there 
broke asunder the vessel in the disaster whereby Nero calculated 
to rid himself of his mother. However, the stratagem failed: re- 
turning from a festival at Baiae, Agrippina and her women leapt 
into the sea when the trap was sprung and the ship began to 
capsize; in the darkness the empress was able to swim away, and at 
length reached the shore and made her way home. Thus as it is 
given in Tacitus, the story lends no support to the legend that has 
grown up, that Bauli is the place where this celebrated woman was 
buried. 

Reflecting upon the great emperor’s scheme, “I am much 
taken,” Clairwil said tc me, “by the artfulness that entered into 
Nero’s efforts to slay his mother. They reveal a cruelty, a perfidy, 
a repudiation of every virtue which endears that personage to me. 
He had been very fond of Agrippina; Suetonius assures us that he 
often masturbated at the thought of her . . . and he finally kills 
her. O Nero, let me venzrate they memory. Wert thou alive today, 
I would adore thee as 2 god, and to me thou wilt be an eternal 
model and an inspiration.” 

After this amusing peroration from Clairwil, ever guided by 
Raphael whom Olympia caressed unceasingly while my friend and 


Juliette & 955 


I were chatting together, we proceeded on along the coast, so 
renowned in olden days for the multitude of superb villas that 
lined it; only a few impoverished fishermen inhabit it at present. 
The first important object one encounters there is the fortress 
which defends it at this end. By and by one comes to the beach, and 
one is now on the spot where famous Baiae once flourished, center 
of delights and of debauchery, whither the Romans used to repair 
for the lewdest and most heteroclite revelries. This must indeed 
have been a wonderful town to live in, shielded by mountains from 
the northern winds, and open toward the south, so that the sun, 
source of life-sustaining warmth and fuel to natural passions, might 
play its sacred and miracle-working rays upon this divine country’s 
lucky inhabitants. Despite all the convulsions which over the cen- 
turies have shaken the terrain, one still breathes here that mild and 
voluptuous air, poison to austerities and virtues, delicate aliment 
to vice and all the so-called crimes of lust. In this connection, my 
friends, you will recall Seneca’s invectives; but that severe moral- 
ist’s reproaches made no headway against Nature’s irresistible 
influences, and the while his contemporaries read his philosophy, 
they were pleased to outrage his principles in the most flagrant 
manner possible. 

A single fisherman’s rickety hut is all that survives today of 
once sumptuous Baiae; a few interesting bits of rubble—all that 
marks its erstwhile grandeur. 

Venus had necessarily to be the favorite divinity of a town so 
corrupt. Vestiges of her temple still exist, but in such a state of 
dilapidation that it is difficult to judge of the past from this 
present evidence. It includes underground passageways, shadowy 
and mysterious corridors suggesting that these premises were used 
for very secret ceremonies. A subtle fire ignited in our veins the 
moment we entered them; Olympia bent close to me, and I saw 
fuck speak in her eyes. 

“Raphael,” Clairwil exclaimed, ‘we must perform our duties 
in this holy place.” 

“You drained me dry,” our guide replied, “and gadding up 
and down this way has wearied me to the bone. However, I know 
four or five fishermen nearby who will ask no more than to content 
you.” 


956 e¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Having said that, he is not six minutes fetching back some 
very unseemly but also very numerous company. 

Blinded by the libertinage consuming us all three, we had, 
without thinking, put ourselves in a perilous situation. For what, 
in this ill-lighted and secluded place, what could a trio of women 
do against the ten men advancing insolently toward them? Forti- 
fied by the inspirations of the goddess who protects vice, we held 
our ground. 

“Friends,” Olymp.a said to that crew in Italian, “we have 
not wanted to conclude our tour of Venus’ sanctuary without mak- 
ing a sacrifice to her; will you act a while as her priests?” 

“Why not?” said one of those bumpkins, snatching up the 
orator’s skirts. 

“Come on, let’s fuck ’em,” said another, laying hands on me. 

However, fancying they were to be left out, the seven who 
were not chosen fell to grumbling, and knives were halfway drawn 
when I quickly endeavored to prove that with a little dexterity, each 
of us could receive three of them at once. I offer the example: one 
encunts me, I present my behind to a second, and suck a third; my 
companions follow suit. Raphael, exhausted, stands by and watches, 
and there we all are, fucking the crowd like hussies. One has no 
idea of the thickness cf the Neapolitan prick: although we had 
promised to suck the third, we were reduced to frigging it instead, 
none of us being able to get it into our mouth. Once they had spent 
a while rambling through one sector they would shift off into 
another, that is to say, each of them fucked us cuntwise and ass- 
wise, and all discharged three times at least. The dim light in this 
place, the mysteries that used to be celebrated here, the order of 
persons with whom we were dealing, perhaps even the dangers we 
were running, all had heated our brains, and the desire for horrors 
took hold of us. But, ours being the weaker side, how were we to 
contrive to execute them? 

“Have you any candy?” I asked Clairwil in a whisper. 

“Yes,” she replied, “I never go anywhere unsupplied.” 

“Well then, offer some to our champions.” 

Olympia, acquainted with our intentions, explains to our 
rustic fuckers that these sweetmeats will have a restorative effect 


Juliette 957 


upon them. I hand the medicine around—in such instances I al- 
ways coveted the role of distributor; our rascals swallow the dose. 

‘Another fucking from each of them,” Clairwil murmured to 
me; “now that death is in their bloodstreams, let us wring from 
them the last measure of seed Nature will ever generate in their 
balls.” 

“Excellent,” said I, “but might they not transmit to us the 
venom already circulating in their veins?” 

‘Keep them away from your mouth, let them have anything 
else. There is not the least danger,” Clairwil added; “I have per- 
formed such extravagances a hundred times over, and you see the 
blooming health I am in... .” 

That woman’s appalling character electrified me; I did as she 
—and in all my life I had never tasted keener pleasures. The cer- 
tainty that through my villainies the man I held in my arms would 
only retire out of my embrace to fall into death’s, this perfidious, 
this barbarous idea contributed such a potent spice to my fucking 
that I swooned away during its crisis. 

‘Hurry, let’s up and away,” I said to my friends as soon as I 
returned to my senses; ‘‘we do not wish to be in this cellar when 
their gripes begin.” 

We ascended to daylight. Raphael, who had neither partici- 
pated in the games nor been included in their cruel aftermath, 
continued to act as our guide; as for the nine men we left behind, 
although we were never to hear tell of them again, what befell 
them is certain, for the means we employed for our atrocity were 
too reliable to fail of grisly success. 

‘And so, my dear,” I said to Clairwil, ‘“‘we are now to con- 
clude that villainy has so far progressed in you that you are no 
longer capable of being fucked by a man without desiring his 
death?” 

‘“°Tis only too true,” my friend acknowledged; “beloved 
Juliette, rare are they who understand what it means, to age in 
crime. Its roots reach so deep inside us, it becomes to such a degree 
one with our existence, that, precisely, we breathe for it alone. Will 
you believe that I regret those instants in my life when I am not 
soiled by some horror? My desire is to do nothing else; I would 


958 be THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


that no idea enter my head but it tend toward crime, that my 
hands toil at nothing but to bring about what my brain has just 
conceived. Oh, Juliette! how mighty are the delights of evil-doing, 
how the mind catches fire at the thought of violating, with im- 
punity, all the laughable prohibitions which hold men captive. What 
superiority one achieves over them by breaking, as we do, all the 
rules which confine them, by transgressing their laws, profaning 
their religion, by denying, insulting, jeering at their execrable God; 
by defying even the disgusting precepts which, as they dare say, 
comprise the primary duties Nature enjoins upon us. Ah, not to be 
able to find something hicleous enough, of sufficient magnitude, that, 
I tell you, is the cause of my grief today; however frightful a given 
crime may be, still it fal)s short of what my mind strives toward. 
Could I set the planet ablaze, even so would I curse the Nature 
that had provided only ore world for my desires to feast upon.” 

Conversing in that strain, we strolled through the rest of the 
countryside around Baiae, where every twenty paces brings one to 
the remains of some precious monument; and at last, by an agree- 
able lane bordered by evergreen hedges, we came to the banks of 
Lake Avernus. Altogether disappeared was that noxious atmos- 
phere which, in bygone days, used to cause overflying birds to fall 
dead into the lake; the quality of its waters and therefore of the 
air above has long since changed, ’tis today a very wholesome 
place, and in all the country one of those most congenial to a 
philosophic spirit. It was here that Aeneas sacrificed to the gods 
of the underworld before setting off along those tenebrous paths 
which the sibyl bade him take. And to the left is that sibyl’s grotto, 
still easy of access. ’Tis a cave, one hundred eighty feet long, eleven 
wide, nine high. Examine the place with a little care, free yourself 
a little from the romantic notions the poets and the historians have 
handed down to us, and you speedily recognize this sibyl for what 
she was, a procuress, arid this lair of hers a whorehouse. That 
interpretation is only borne out by a more thorough survey of the 
premises; and if, when studying them, one refers oneself to 
Petronius’ ideas rather than to Virgil’s descriptions, one will not 
come away with any other opinion. 

A cluster of orange trees, which, near the opposite shore, 
rises from within a Temple of Pluto, makes for a sight as pic- 


Juliette & 959 


turesque as any in the world. We visited those ruins, plucked some 
oranges, and started back toward Pozzuoli, passing between the 
still existing tombs lining the Appian Way on both its sides. There, 
we could not keep from exclaiming against the ridiculous attitude 
the Romans observed toward the dead. We sat us down by 
Faustina’s tomb, and Olympia gave voice to the observations which 
follow. 

“Two things I have never understood, my friends,” that 
amiable and witty woman began, “they are respect for the dead, 
and respect for the wishes of the dead. Assuredly, both these 
superstitions relate to the notions people entertain touching the 
immortality of the soul; for were they convinced materialists, were 
they wholly persuaded that we are nought but an amalgam of 
mere material elements, that once smitten by death, our dissolu- 
tion is complete, then respect shown to bits of decomposed matter 
would appear such palpable nonsense that nobody would think to 
espouse it. But our pride is loath to acknowledge this certitude of 
no longer existing; instead, we prefer to believe that the shades of 
the departed, yet hovering around his corpse, expect consideration 
to be shown to this derelict; one dreads offending them, and thus, 
without realizing it, one slips into the worst impiety and the most 
entire absurdity. So let us make thoroughly our own the doctrine 
that once we are dead, absolutely nothing of us exists anymore, 
and that this mortal coil we leave on earth is nothing else than what 
‘our excrements were, when we dropped them at the foot of a tree 
in those days when we were alive. Well-penetrated by this system, 
we would sense that to a cadaver neither honor nor concern nor 
duties are owing; that the only treatment it merits, far less for its 
sake than for ours, is burial, incineration, or to be fed to scaven- 
gers; but that homages, sepulchers, prayers, memorials are not in 
any wise its due, and all of them nothing but the tributes stupidity 
pays to vanity, tributes which philosophy annihilates. To be sure, 
this that I advance clashes with all religious beliefs, ancient and 
modern, but ’tis not to you that it is necessary to prove that noth- 
ing is more absurd than religions, all based upon the loathsome 
fable of the soul’s eternal indestructibility and upon the ridiculous 
existence of a God. There is no stupidity religions have omitted to 
revere; and you know just as well as I, my friends, that when one 


960 -% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


examines a human institution, the first thing one must do is discard 
all religious notions. They are poison to lucidity.” 

“I am perfectly of our companion’s mind,” said Clairwil, 
‘although odd as it may seem, there are libertines who have con- 
structed passions upon a foundation of those beliefs. In Paris I 
often saw one man pay its weight in gold for the body of any 
freshly interred adolescent, boy or girl, who had met with a 
violent death: he would have them brought to his house, and 
would commit no end cf horrors upon those still well-preserved 
corpses.” 

“It has been understood for a long time,” I pointed out, “that 
the enjoyment of a recently assassinated individual may be truly 
very voluptuous; the constriction of the anus is especially appreci- 
ated by men.” 

‘‘Also,” said Clairwil, “there is a kind of imaginary impiety 
therein to heat the mind, and for a certainty I would try it if my 
sex permitted.” 

“This fantasy ought by all rights to lead to murder,” I 
proposed to my friends, “‘for once a cadaver becomes an agreeable 
plaything, one is alreacy on the edge of a deed which would 
multiply one’s pleasures.” 

“Probably,” Clairwil rejoined, “but that need not disturb 
us. If it is a great pleasure to kill, you will agree that it can 
hardly be a great evil.” 

And as it was well on in the afternoon, we hastened to regain 
Pozzuoli, passing by way of the ruins of Cicero’s handsome villa. 

It was late when we returned; a crowd of lazzaroni stood 
waiting at our gate. Raphael explained that since report had gone 
out that we were friendly toward men, most of those in the neigh- 
borhood had come to offer their services. 

“You have nothing to fear,” our guide continued, ‘‘they are 
decent people, they know that you pay well, they will fuck you 
accordingly. In my country we are straightforward about these 
matters; and you are not the first lady travelers to have felt our 
muscles.” 

“Taxing as the day has been,” said Clairwil, ‘it would be 
wrong for us to turn away men of good will. I have always found 
that further exercise does more to relax the frame than mere

repose: come, surrendering ourselves to the labors of Love, we 
shall forget those of Apollo. me 

But as at this point Nature’s demands had all been met; 4s, 
sated on debauchery, we could indulge in nothing further save 
from libertinage, we flung ourselves into the nastiest excesses. 

Thirty men culled from among better than a hundred, and 
whose members were gigantic, encloseted themselves with us; not 
one of them was over thirty years of age, not one had a weapon 
under thirteen inches in length by eight around; ten little peasant 
girls of between seven and twelve, whom we bought for their 
weight in gold, were also included in those orgies. After a magnifi- 
cent dinner during which some three hundred bottles of Falerno 
were consumed, we opened by marshaling all the pricks in a row, 
lightly exciting them ourselves; next, we formed all those rascals 
in single file, so that they made up a long chaplet, each with his 
prick in the ass of the man ahead; the ten little girls, naked, frigged 
us in the meantime. We reviewed the formation, verified the in- 
troductions, fondled all the balls, and tongued all the mouths; 
turning, we retraced our steps, this time presenting our buttocks 
to be kissed by each of the chaplet’s thirty elements. They had all 
been severely warned against any careless discharging in one 
another’s behinds; as soon as they were at peak erection, they 
were, one by one, to move forward out of line, place their foaming 
engine in the hands of a little girl who would promptly bring it 
over and stopper either one of our asses or one of our cunts. Thus 
were we had thirty times over; after that we each took five men 
upon the body, this making six teams, which fucked us team by 
team; there was a prick in each aperture, one in the mouth or else 
niched between the breasts when it was too big for oral accommoda- 
tion, then one in either hand. Throughout this scene, the ten little 
girls, perched on chairs, formed a circle around us, with orders to 
sprinkle us with shit and urine. For my part, I can think of nothing 
which arouses me more than one such inundation; I like to be 
bathed in it when I fuck; soon we were presenting asses only. 
Sprawled upon three little girls whose tongues were tickling us in 
the mouth, about the cunt, and thrilling upon the clitoris, we re- 
ceived three successive sodomizations from each of our thirty 
servants. That done, three of them cunt-sucked us, three sucked 


962 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


our mouths, we frigged one with each hand, and each of us was 
wet upon the belly or the nipples by a discharge wheedled from a 
prick by one of the little girls; the little girls then frigged all 
thirty upon our clitorises; one of them not engaged in frigging, 
wet, smeared, rubbed that delicate part with the sperm her com- 
panion made spurt, while a third, squatting over our faces, gave 
us an open cunt or asshole to lick. 

A flagellation followed. We whipped the men who, at the 
same time, were doing the same to the children; next, we had our- 
selves bound, our hands were raised, our wrists tied to the bed- 
posts, our ankles to the foot of the bed; and each man administered 
us a hundred strokes: while being beaten we pissed on the faces of 
three little girls who placed themselves between our thighs for this 
ceremony; after that, we surrendered the ten minors to our thirty 
fuckers, who depucelatec| and ravaged all ten of them, before and 
behind. Then we gave those ten children a vigorous fustigation, 
while the men kicked our asses with all their might: incredibly 
irritated by this treatment, we had ourselves more soundly drubbed 
by them; it was only when they had beaten us to the floor that they 
obtained, through this tr:umph, the right to embugger us yet again, 
and while we were enduring this latest affront, four of them at a 
time would come forward and fart, piss, and shit all over our 
faces; we did the same sort of thing to the little girls, who were 
obliged to swallow what we ejected upon them; finally, we afixed 
silken ribbons to the ceiling and tied all the pricks up in the air 
this way, rubbed all the talls with brandy, set fire to them and from 
this concluding rite we each of us obtained one last ejaculation in 
the womb or in the bowels, depending upon the individual assail- 
ant’s whim. 

Foreigners in this town, although authorized by the King, 
whose patents of impunity were in our pocket, we desisted from 
further excesses so as not to arouse the populace; and having dis- 
tributed much money to all that rabble and sent it contentedly on 
its way, we lay down for a few hours’ rest; then rose up and went 
forth to resume our interesting perambulations. We made a rapid 
tour of the isles, Procida and Ischia, and went back the next day 
to Naples, en route inspecting all sorts of wreckage fascinating for 


Juliette % 963 


its antiquity, and many country villas, delightful through their 
location. 

Ferdinand had sent out for news of us; we went to tell him 
of the powerful impression made upon us by the beauties of the 
region around his capital. He proposed to take us, several days 
later, to a supper at the residence of the Prince Francavilla, the 
richest lord in Naples, and at the same time the greatest bugger. 

“They defy the imagination,” the King assured us, “the 
prodigies he acquits himself of in this kind. I shall ask him not to 
let our presence incommode him,” the monarch went on, “and 
explain that we are only paying a visit in order to examine philo- 
sophically his debauches.” 

We accepted. The Queen was with us. 

In all Italy, nothing equals Francavilla’s magnificence and 
grand spending; there are sixty places set at his table every day, 
his guests are waited upon by two hundred domestics, all of the 
very fairest mien. The Prince, to receive us, had had a temple of 
Priapus raised in a grove in his garden. Mysterious pathways 
bordered by orange trees and myrtle led to this wondrously lighted 
sanctuary ; columns wreathed with roses and lilacs were surmounted 
by a cupola beneath which stood an altar covered with soft grass, 
to the right; to the left, a table set for six; in the center, a great 
basket of flowers, whose shoots and festoons, laden with colored 
lampions, rose in garlands to the summit of the cupola. Different 
groups of practically naked youths, three hundred of them all told, 
were scattered about wherever there was space available, and atop 
the altar of grass appeared Francavilla, standing underneath the 
emblem of Priapus, deity in whose shrine we were forgathered; 
groups of children went forward by turns to bow down before the 
Prince. 

“Most honored Lord,” the Queen said to him as she made 
her entrance, “‘we have come to this hallowed place to partake 
sympathetically of your pleasures, to meditate before your mys- 
teries; proceed as you are wont to do; enjoy the multiple homages 
about to be rendered you; we wish but to contemplate them.” 

Banks of flowers lay opposite the altar, we sat ourselves 
down upon them; the god descended, bent over the altar, and the 
ceremony began. 


964 <t* THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Francavilla offered the world’s most comely ass to our view; 
to two young children, stationed hard by that notable posterior, 
was entrusted the care of opening it, of wiping it, and of guiding 
toward the hole the monstrous members which, by the score, were 
shortly to fling into the sanctum sanctoris; twelve other children 
readied the pricks. I had never in all my days seen any service more 
nimbly accomplished. Thus prepared, those splendid members 
moved from hand to hand until they arrived in those of the chil- 
dren appointed to introduce them; they disappeared then into the 
ass of the patient: they came back out again, they were replaced by 
others; and-all that with an effortlessness, a smoothness, a prompti- 
tude which compel wonder. In less than two hours, all the three 
hundred pricks had sped into Francavilla’s fundament, who, once 
everything had been gulped greedily down, turned our way, and 
spat, following a violent pollution by a pair of young Ganymedes, 
a few drops of watery whitish sperm, the emission whereof having 
occasioned him five or six: piercing shrieks, restored him completely 
to calm. 

He then addressed us. ‘‘My ass is in a calamitous state,” he 
declared, stepping toward us; ‘“‘your wish was to see it treated 
unsparingly, I have satisfied you. I venture to say, by the by, that 
not one of you dear ladies has ever in her life been fucked as I 
have just been.” 

“Gracious, no,” said Clairwil, still deeply impressed by the 
demonstration we had witnessed, “‘but I am prepared to measure 
my endurance against yours whenever you like, Prince, and whether 
in the ass, whether in the cunt, I wager I can outfuck you.” 

“Softly, dear heart, softly,” said Charlotte, “you have seen 
only a mild sample of what my cousin Francavilla is capable of; 
without flinching, he would stand up to ten battalions.” 

“Let him bring his armies on,” Clairwil rejoined with her 
usual plainspokenness; ‘‘but, Sire, does your Prince fancy we are 
going to be content with having watched his display of prowess ?” 

“Here, most certainly,” the King replied, “for however 
beauteous you be, Mesdames, you must understand that among all 
these young men, there is not one who would be induced even to 
touch you.” 


Juliette 2 965 


“Why, ’tis not as though we were without asses—”’ 

“Not one,” Francavilla afirmed, ‘not one would be tempted 
thereby, and were bullying finally to sway him, I would never again 
accept to hold commerce with the weakling.” 

“That is what they call cleaving to one’s faith,” said Clairwil, 
‘‘and I don’t blame them for it. So let us at least have some supper, 
since there is to be no fucking; let Comus recompense us, if he 
possibly can, for the cruel privations Cypris makes us endure.” 

“You express it admirably,” said Francavilla. 

The greatest supper ever seen by mortal eyes was therewith 
served by the Ganymedes, and the six places occupied by the King, 
the Queen, the Prince, my two sisters, and myself. There is no 
describing the delicacy and the magnificence of the fare: dishes and 
wines from all the countries of the world arrived in lavish profusion 
and uninterruptedly, and, mark of unheard-of luxury, nothing that 
was put on the table was taken off it: a viand or a wine was scarcely 
brought on when it was emptied into huge silver troughs, out of the 
bottom of which everything flowed away into the ground. 

“The wretched might profit from these leavings,” said 
Olympia. 

“Wretched? Our existence upon earth denies that of our 
inferiors,” Francavilla explained; “I loathe the mere idea that 
what is of no use to us could afford relief to someone else.” 

“His heart is as hard as his ass is generous,” remarked 
Ferdinand. 

‘I have nowhere encountered such prodigality,” said Clairwil, 
“but I like it. That arrangement whereby scraps are saved for the 
scullery has chilling effects upon the imagination. Such orgies owe 
part of their success to the delicious realization that nothing and 
no one else matters on earth.” 

“Why, what do the underprivileged matter to me when I want 
for nothing,” said the Prince; “their hardships add a further 
poignancy to my joys, I would not be so happy if I did not know 
there was suffering nearby, and ’tis from this advantageous com- 
parison half the pleasure in life is born.” 

“That comparison,” I said, “is very cruel.” 

“Tt is natural; nothing is crueler than Nature, and those who 


966 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


observe her instructions to the letter will always be murderers or 
villains.” 

“My friend,” said Ferdinand, “all those are sound precepts, 
but they are hurtful to your reputation: if you but knew what they 
say about you in Naples. .. .” 

“Oh, I am not one to take calumny very seriously,” was the 
Prince’s reply, “and a reputation is such a little thing, an asset so 
meager, that I am not in the slightest put out if others amuse them- 
selves gossiping about the things which procure me quite as much 
amusement from others.’ 

“Ah, my Lord,” I said to this distinguished libertine, affecting 
a dogmatic tone, “they are passions which have brought you to this 
degree of blindness, and the passions are not the means through 
which Nature expresses her will, as the corrupt likes of you are 
prone to claim. They are the products of God’s wrath; and we can 
obtain deliverance from their imperious grip by imploring the 
mercy of the Eternal, but that mercy we must earn. ’Tis not by 
having three or four hundred pricks thrust into your ass every day, 
’tis not by permanent avoidance of holy confession, by never par- 
taking of the treasured favors of the eucharist, ’tis not by stiffening 
yourself against good intentions you will bathe in the glow of 
Grace. No, Sire, no, ’tis not through such conduct you will blot out 
your sins or attain their remission. Ah, my Lord, how must I 
pity you if you persevere in this misbehavior; think of the fate 
awaiting you in the next world: how can you, free to set a course 
toward good or toward evil, imagine that the just God who has 
given you this free will shall not punish you for the wicked use you 
have put it to? Do you believe, my friend, that an eternity of 
sufferings does not warrant a little reflection, and that before the 
certainty of those sufferings it is not worth sacrificing a few miser- 
able penchants, which, even in this life, for the very slender 
pleasure they bring you, cause you cares, worries, distress, regrets 


22 Nature's primary impulses are invariably criminal; those which steer us to- 
ward virtuousness are merely secondary, and never but the fruit of education, of 
debility, or of fear. The individual Nature molds for kingship, who, once out of her 
hands, falls into the hands of no educators and who by dint of his new position 
becomes the most powerful of men and immune to fear, that royal personage, I say, 
will take his daily bath in the blood of his subjects; and will be the natural man 
besides. 


Juliette 967 


without end? In one word, is it to be fucked that the Supreme Be- 
ing brought you into this world?” 

Francavilla and the King gazed at me dumbfounded, and for 
a moment even imagined | had lost my wits. 

Ferdinand finally broke the silence. “Juliette,” he said, “if 
you are preparing a second chapter to that sermon, tell us so in 
order that we can listen to it lying down.” 

‘Tam now come to such a point of impiety and of abandon of 
all religious sentiment,” Francavilla declared, ‘‘that my calm is 
imperiled by the barest allusion to this deific phantom, dreamt up 
by the priests who grub their livelihood from ministering to it; I 
shudder in horror merely at the mention of its name. 

“Throughout every land,” the Prince continued, ‘“‘we hear it 
announced that a God has revealed himself; what is his message 
to men? Does he demonstrate his evident existence to them? Does 
he teach them what he is? In what his essence consists? Does he 
clearly explain his intentions to them, his plans? That which we 
are told concerning what he has said about his plans, does it accord 
with the effects we observe? Why, no; he intimates to us only that 
he is the one who is, that he is a hidden God; that his ineffable ways 
surpass understanding, that he waxes wroth as soon as anyone has 
the temerity to pry into his secrets and to consult reason in order 
to evaluate him or judge of his works. Does the revealed comport- 
ment of this infamous God correspond to the lofty notions we are 
asked to entertain of his wisdom, of his goodness . . . of his justice 

. of his benevolence . . . of his supreme power ? Not at all: how- 
ever we scan him, we see him everywhere and always partial, 
capricious, malignant, tyrannical, unjust, at the very most good 
for a people he happens to favor, the sworn enemy of everybody 
else; if he deigns to show himself to some men, he is careful to 
keep all others in darkest ignorance of his divine intentions. Is this 
not the picture all revelations give of your abominable God? 
Do the aims disclosed by this God bear the stamp of reason and 
wisdom? Do they conduce to the well-being of the people to whom 
this fabulous goblin declares himself? Upon examining these divine 
decrees, in no country do I find anything but bizarre ordinances, 
ridiculous injunctions, ceremonies whose purpose cannot be guessed, 
puerile practices, an etiquette unworthy of the monarch of Nature, 


968 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


offerings, sacrifices, expiations useful indeed to the ministers of this 
insipid illusion, but exceedingly burdensome to mankind. I find, 
moreover, that these regulations very often have for effect or 
design to render human beings unsociable, disdainful, intolerant, 
quarrelsome, unjust and inhuman toward all those who have not 
received the same revelation, nor the same laws, nor the same 
favors from heaven. And there’s the execrable God you preach 
to me, Juliette, and you would have me worship such a phantom!” 

“I too would have you worship him,” said Ferdinand. “Kings 
always encourage religion, religion has since the very beginning 
lent sinews to tyranny. The day man ceases to believe in God he 
will assassinate his rulers.’ 

“There is no telling which he may decide to destroy first,” 
I interjected; “but, be sure of it, once he has overthrown the one, 
it will not be long before he finishes off the other. And if you care 
to set aside your despot’s point of view for a moment, and weigh 
the matter by philosophic standards, you will admit that the world 
would only be the better off if it had neither tyrants nor priests: 
they are monsters that fatten on the substance of nations, and 
that never render them any services lest it be to impoverish or to 
blind them.” 

“This woman here does not like kings,” said Ferdinand. 

“Or gods either,” I replied. “In my eyes, the former are all 
tyrants, the latter all spooks, and I hold that one must never 
despotize over men nor deceive them, Nature, when she cast us 
into the world, created us free and atheists. Force brought weak- 
ness to heel, and we got kings. Imposture overawed fools, we had 
gods. Well, in all that [ see cunning scoundrels and phantoms 
aplenty, but not the sligh:est hint of natural inspiration.” 

‘What would men do without kings or without gods ?” 

“They would become more free, more philosophical, and 
therefore more worthy of the intentions Nature has in their regard, 
Nature who created ther. neither to vegetate beneath the scepter 
of an individual no better endowed than they, nor to hobble in the 
fetters of a god who is nought but the contrivance of a few fanatic 
imaginations.” 

“One moment,” said Francavilla, “I am won over to part of 
Juliette’s argument. No (sod—she is right, indubitably; but that 


Juliette & 969 


curb gone, some other must be found for the people: the philos- 
opher has no need of one, I know, but restraints are salutary for 
the rabble, and upon it alone royal authority must make itself felt, 
that is what I urge.” 

‘We are fully agreed,” I said, “like you, I yielded this point 
to Ferdinand when we first discussed these affairs together.” 

“Then,” Francaville resumed, ‘‘it is by the extremest terror 
religious chimeras must be replaced; deliver the people from the 
fear of a hell to come and they'll go berserk straightway; instead, 
for that superstitious dread substitute a prodigiously more severe 
penal code, laws which are aimed exclusively at the people, since 
nobody else threatens the State, discontents always arising from 
that one class. The rich man will not fret at the idea of restraints 
which never affect him, since he buys himself out of all objections 
of principle when, with his money, he acquires in his turn the right 
to vex all those who live under his heel. You will never find a single 
member of the upper class resenting even the blackest shadow of 
tyranny when he is able to exercise real tyranny over his inferiors. 
These bases established, it is therefore necessary that a suzerain 
rule with utmost harshness, and that to certify his right to do what 
he likes to the people, he leave his allies free in their turn to 
undertake, within their own provinces, whatever suits their pleas- 
ure; these latter he must cuirass with his influence, his might, his 
consideration; to them he must say, 4nd you too, promulgate laws, 
but such only as will buttress mine; and in order that my blows be 
telling, in order that my throne be unshakable, support my power 
with all that portion of power I leave to you, and enjoy your 
privileges in a peaceful manner, in such sort that mine are never 
endangered....” 

“That,” said Olympia, “is the pact which kings once made 
with the clergy.” 

“Yes; but the clergy, basing its power upon the omnipotence 
of a fantastic God, became stronger than the royalty; the priests 
assassinated kings instead of supporting them, and that is not 
what I am asking for: I wish final authority to remain with the 
government, while the authority it leaves to the upper class and to 
philosophers would be utilized by them only in the interests of 
their individual passions, upon condition these at all times and in 


970 de THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


every sense promote the interests of the State; for the State can 
never be governed uniquely either by theocrat or by despot; the 
chief agent of that State must annihilate the first rival to pose a 
threat to his power, sorne of which he must share with those who, 
seeing themselves standing to gain from his pre-eminence over 
them, agree to come now and then to his aid with those forces 
which he allows them to enjoy in peace when he is himself at 
peace, everyone, chief and vassals, joining forces to combat, to sub- 
due, to fetter the popular hydra, the sole aim of whose strivings is 
always to burst the chains that keep it in subservience.” 

“Pursuant to this line of reasoning, it is certain,” said 
Clairwil, “that the laws. enacted against the population cannot be 
too repressive.” 

“They must be modeled upon those of Draco,” said Franca- 
villa, “they must be written out in blood, must be revitalized by 
blood, must cause it to flow every day, must, above all, keep the 
people in the most deplorable poverty; the people are never dan- 
gerous save when comfo-table—” 

“And when educated ?” 

“And when educated, to be sure: they must hence be kept in 
the profoundest ignorance as well; their slavery must be perpetual 
and grinding, and every possible means of escape from it must be 
denied them, as will assuredly be the case when the figures who 
support and surround the government are there to prevent the 
people from breaking loose from irons which it is in the upper 
class’ interests to tighten day and night. You cannot imagine how 
far such tyranny is able to extend.” 

“T sense it,” said Clairwil; ‘‘yes, I sense that it would reach 
the point where those rogues depended utterly upon the tyrant, 
or upon those near him, for the very right to breathe.” 

“That’s it,” said the Prince, seizing enthusiastically at this 
idea, ‘the government itself must regulate the population, must 
command all the means for snuffing it out if it becomes trouble- 
some, for increasing it if that is esteemed advantageous; its justice 
must never be weighed elsewhere than in the scales of the ruler’s 
interests or passions, combined solely with the passions and interests 
of those who, as we have just said, have obtained from him all 
the allotments of authority .necessary to multiply his own a hun- 


Juliette %& 971 


dredfold when they are conjugated.”* Glance at the governments 
of Africa and Asia: all of them are organized in accordance with 
these principles, and all invariably maintain themselves thereby.” 

“In many of them,” said Charlotte, ‘the people are not 
reduced to what you seem to consider their appropriate condition.” 

“True,” Francavilla admitted, “there have been stirrings in 
a few outlying districts, and there is work yet to be done before 
the masses are in such a state of dread and exhaustion that they 
cease even to be able to conceive of revolt.” 

“It is to that end,” said Ferdinand, “I would like to see priests 
among them.” 

“Beware of that expedient, since, as you have just been told, 
it is the surest way to raise up a power that will soon eclipse your 
own by dint of the deific machinery which, in the clergy’s hands, 
serves only to forge weapons for the destruction of governments, 
and which is never used for any other purpose; atheize and inces- 
santly demoralize the people whom you wish to subjugate; so long 
as they cringe before no god but you, so long as there are no morals 
except yours, you will always be their sovereign.” 

“An immoral man is dangerous,” said Ferdinand. 

“Yes, when he has some authority, because he then feels the 
urge to abuse it; never, when he is a slave. It matters very little 
that a man believe or not believe there is wrong in killing me, 
once I have so thoroughly shackled him that he has not the means 
to harm a fly; and when moral depravity has softened him, he will 
be that much less loath to wear the collar I rivet round his neck.” 

“But,” asked Charlotte, ‘‘how is he to become soft under the 
yoke? Rather, it would seem to me, only luxury and easy living 
have that effect upon man.” 

“His fiber rots in the thick of crime,” the Prince rejoined. 
“Now, leave him the broadest outlets for his criminal capacities; 
never punish him save when his darts are directed against you; so 
proceed and you will obtain two excellent results: the immorality 
that you require, and depopulation, which may often be of even 
greater usefulness to you. Allow incest, rape, murder among your 
subjects; forbid them marriage, authorize sodomy, prohibit them

of La Nouvelle Justine, pp. 275ft.

worship of any sort, and you will soon have them reduced to the 
abjection your policy demands. 

‘And how do you multiply punishments when you tolerate 
everything meriting them?” I wondered, with some appearance of 
logic. 

“Why,” said Francavilla, “it’s virtues you then hammer, or 
revolts against your power; and, never fear, you have a thousand 
times more of them than you need in order to be busy striking off 
heads all day long. Besides, are motives so indispensable? The 
despot obtains blood whenever he likes, his will alone is enough 
to cause it to flow: conspiracies may be supposed at any time; you 
foment them, you occas‘on them; the scaffolds go up, and in the 
twinkle of an eye, there’s a carnage.” 

“If Ferdinand cares to leave these matters in my hands,” said 
Charlotte, “I guarantee him I shall provide legitimate pretexts 
every day: let him sharpen the blade and I shall furnish the 
victims.” 

“Cousin,” said the King, ‘‘my wife is becoming fidgety.” 

“I am not surprised,” said Clairwil, ‘for I am myself fear- 
fully on edge. To watch fuck and fuck not is cruel when you have 
a warm constitution.” 

“Let us then go out for a breath of air,” said the Prince; 
“in these wooded bowers we may perhaps find the wherewithal to 
appease these ladies’ ardors.” 

All the gardens were illuminated: from orange trees, peach 
trees, apricot trees, fig trees we plucked fruit cooled by the evening 
dews as we strolled along the delightful pathways that brought us 
to the, Temple of Ganymede. This temple was softly lit by tapers 
set high under the ceiling, which reflected light enough for pleasures 
but not so much as to ‘ire the eye. Green and rose-colored columns 
supported this edifice, garlands of myrtle and lilac twined around 
them and formed agreeable festoons between one column and the 
next. 

No sooner were we arrived there than subdued music filled the 
air with sweetness. Charlotte, drunk with lust and very hot from 
wine and spirits, proceecled straight to the nearest couch, and we 
others did the same. 

“°Tis their turn now,” Francavilla said to the King, “they 


yy 


Juliette 973 


must be left to show what they can do, with the essential recom- 
mendation, nevertheless, to offer nothing but their asses, for this 
is a place of worship consecrated to the adoration of asses only; 
any deviation from these laws would be a sin warranting expulsion 
from the temple. Moreover, the agents that will be furnished to 
them would consent to no infidelity.” 

“Little do we care,” said Clairwil, the first of us to have 
stripped off her clothes. ““We much prefer having our asses used 
than our cunts, and provided we receive friggings meanwhile, 
there will be no regrets heard from us.” 

Francavilla now drew away the pink satin spread covering 
what we supposed was an ottoman. Ah, what an extraordinary 
article that drapery had been concealing! Imagine a long couch 
with separate places, or rather stalls, for four; each woman was 
to enter the stall and kneel on the seat reserved for her, her rump 
raised high, her thighs spread wide; her elbows rested on chair- 
arms padded with cotton and covered with black satin, as was the 
rest of this uncommon piece of furniture. By her hands and within 
easy reach were the loins of two men, one on either side, who to 
her manipulation provided each a gigantean member, the only 
part of them that was visible, their bodies being otherwise hidden 
underneath black shrouds. Cunningly disposed platforms supported 
those recumbent bodies, and a mechanism ensured that once those 
pricks had discharged, they disappeared in a trice and were replaced 
by new ones the next instant. 

Yet another and still’ more unusual fixture operated’ beneath 
the woman’s belly. By taking her position in the stall, that woman 
lowered herself over, and engulfed, unavoidably and, as it were, 
involuntarily, a soft and flexible dildo which, through a system of 
springs and clockwork, filed away automatically and without cease, 
every fifteen minutes squirting a given measure of warm and sticky 
fluid into her vagina, that fluid possessing an odor and a viscosity 
which would have led anyone to mistake it for the purest, the 
freshest sperm. A very pretty girl, of whom nothing but the head 
was visible, with her chin pressed against the dildo, frigged, 
lingually, the clitoris of the woman, and was likewise relayed by 
another, by means of a trap-door arrangement, as soon as she 
began to tire. Ahead of the woman placed as I have described 


974 <& THE MARQUIS ‘DE SADE 


there were to be seen, upon round stools, other objects, which were 
varied or replaced when the woman so desired; upon those stools, 
I say, One saw cunts or pricks; in a manner that this woman had at 
the level of her mouth, and could conveniently suck, either a penis 
or aclitoris. In sum, it resulted that the woman, kneeling upon the 
cushioned seat containing: the levers which set everything in motion, 
and comfortably resting upon her elbows, was tupped by a dildo, 
mouthed by a girl, while frigging a prick with each hand, presenting 
her ass to the very genuine prick which was to come up and sod- 
omize her, and alternately sucking, according to her tastes, now a 
prick, now a cunt, even an asshole. 

“T do not believe,” said Clairwil, setting herself, stark naked, 
in one of the stalls, “‘that anything more extraordinarily lubricious 
could possibly be invented; simply to adopt thts posture,” she con- 
tinued, “puts me fairly in a frenzy, simply to take my place here is 
making me discharge.” 

Olympia, Charlotte, and I took our places beside Clairwil. 
Four girls of sixteen, naked and fair as angels, helped situate us; 
they oiled the dildoes to facilitate their entry; they adjusted our 
positions; then, parting our buttocks, they likewise anointed our 
assholes, and stood by to attend to us during the operation. 

Francavilla then gave the signal. Four maids of fifteen led in, 
by the prick, a like nur.ber of superb boys whose members were 
without delay introduced into our fundaments; exhausted, this 
quadrille was replaced in short order by succeeding ones. Our 
stewardesses remained the same, but the fresh batteries of pricks 
were each time brought in by four new girls who, having handed the 
pricks over to the stewardesses, formed a voluptuous group around 
us and danced to the enchanting sounds of music coming, so it 
seemed, from far away. While dancing they sprinkled our bodies 
with some unidentifiable elixir, each drop of which stung the skin 
sharply and had an incredibly active effect upon our passions: its 
scent was that of jasmine; we were covered with it from head to 
toe. 

All the variations of this scene, what is more, were executed 
with astonishing address and celerity; never were we kept waiting 
for so much as a moment. Before our mouths, cunts and pricks and 
asses succeeded one another as swiftly as our desires; elsewhere, 


Juliette % 975 


the engines we frigged had but to discharge and new ones ma- 
terialized between our fingers; our clitoris-suckers rotated with the 
same speed, and our asses were never deserted; in less than three 
hours, during which we swam in unending delirium, we were ass- 
fucked one hundred times apiece, and polluted the whole time by 
the dildo constantly belaboring our cunt. I was nigh to slain 
by it all. Olympia had collapsed, they had been obliged to lift her 
off her dildo; only Clairwil and Charlotte had stood up ufiwaver- 
ingly to the assault. Fuck, the liquid ejaculated by the dildoes, 
sweat, and blood drenched us all over. Ferdinand and Francavilla, 
who had been amusing themselves with thirty-odd charming bar- 
dashes while watching the spectacle, invited us to pursue the 
promenade; four pretty girls offered us their arms to lean upon, and 
we moved into a spacious summerhouse. 

It was decorated thus: to the right was a wide semicircular 
platform raised three feet above the floor, an amphitheater gar- 
nished with thick mattresses covered in flaming red satin; opposite 
stood another platform, a foot higher, of the same shape, entirely 
carpeted in velvet of the same ‘color. 

“Let us lie down and wallow here for a while,” said the 
Prince, guiding us to the amphitheater, ‘‘and we shall see what 
there is to see.” 

We settled ourselves, and very soon into the center of the hall 
entered a dozen exquisitely lovely girls of between sixteen and 
eighteen. They were arrayed in simple shifts worn in the Greek 
manner, and leaving their bosoms bare; and at her breast, firm and 
white as alabaster, each bore a naked infant, her own offspring, 
and ranging in age from six to eighteen months. At the same time, 
six handsome men, prick in hand, slipped into our midst; two em- 
buggered Ferdinand and Francavilla forthwith; the four others 
proposed us their services, in such manner that we were pleased to 
accept them. 

Once we were all six fucked, the twelve young women formed 
a half-circle around us, their shifts were raised by a similar number 
of little girls dressed in Tartar style; and these children, kneeling 
beside the women whose behinds they had unveiled, exposed to our 
view, in agreeably struck attitudes, the most superb collection of 
buttocks you could ever hope to sce. 


976 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Those are superior asses, yes,” said Francavilla under the 
monstrous prick that was sodomizing him; “but, unfortunately, 
they are destined to our condemnation, and I should be sorry, 
Mesdames, to see you take a too lively interest in them... . Yet, 
notice, if you will, how nicely they are cleft, those asses, what a 
snowy whiteness is theirs. What a shame to treat them as they are 
now going to be.” 

Exeunt the shift-raisers; enter a dozen men of about thirty- 
five, of very male and fierce mien, and costumed as satyrs. Their 
arms are bare, each comes in brandishing a different sort of instru- 
ment for flagellation: they snatch the nurselings out of their young 
mothers’ arms, toss the little creatures into a heap at our feet, 
seize the mothers, drag them by the hair up onto the platform 
opposite us and, mercilessly ripping off the thin garments they are 
wearing, they immobilize them with one hand and set to whipping 
them with the other, in a manner so cruel and for such a len?th 
of time that jets of blood and bits of flesh fly across the whole 
width of the summerhouse, even to where we are. 

Never in my life had I seen such a flogging .. . neither one so 
ferocious nor so thorough, since from the nape of the neck down 
to the heel not an inch was left untouched; those wretches’ shrieks 
could have been heard a league away, and crime was performed so 
openly here that no precaution was taken to muffle them; four of 
those women fainted, fell, and were then whipped back upon their 
feet again. When, seen from the rear, they were but one great 
wound, they were sudderlly let loose. 

A general commotion then occurs, flagellators and flagellated 
collide, push, pull; the ones hurry to replace, in pairs, the first six 
individuals we have been enjoying ; the others scurry anxiously 
about in quest of their progeny. Tangled up as the babes are, 
their mothers identify them, sort them out, press them to their 
trembling lips, hug them to their palpitating breasts; along with 
the thickened milk they fed them, they wash them with the burning 
tears flowing down thei~ cheeks. "Tis to my shame I confess .it, 
good friends, but this effervescence, in contrast with the radically 
different emotions we were being gripped by, caused me two suc- 
cessive spasms as I squirmed under the shaft sounding my anus. 


Juliette 3% 977 


The moment of calm was not long; another twelve men, of more 
awesome aspect then the first platoon and garbed as savages, arrive, 
blasphemy in mouths, martinets in fists. They wrest the infants 
away from those poor souls again, throw them our way with 
greater force than they had been thrown before, in so doing shat- 
tering several little skulls upon the plank floor of our amphitheater, 
drag the women upon the platform opposite, and this time it is 
upon the front of the bodies of those tender mothers, and espe- 
cially upon their delicate breasts, that the storm descends. Those 
sweet, sensitive, and voluptuous globes, crisscrossed by lashes biting 
furiously into flesh, soon yield a horrid mixture of milk and blood, 
geysers of which leap forth in answer to the blows. The barbarians, 
aiming lower down, with the same violence soon lacerate the belly, 
the sex, the inside of the vagina and the thighs and, in an instant, 
these parts, treated as unsparingly as the others, disappear behind 
a mist of blood. And in the meantime we were fucking, and we 
were tasting that supreme pleasure which results from the impact, 
upon stern souls like ours, of the sight of the pain of others. The 
same frantic rush on the part of the women the moment their 
tormentors release them in order to substitute their rigid and foam- 
ing pricks for their dozen predecessors’ limp and drained engines. 
The mothers scramble toward their babes, pick them up, bruised 
and battered as they are, warm them with their anguished kisses, 
wet them with their tears, console them with tender words and in 
their joy at recovering these cherished objects, are almost at the 
point of forgetting what they have undergone, when twelve other 
villains, of a countenance a thousand times more dreadful to behold 
than anything seen hitherto, stride in to accomplish further atroci- 
ties. 

This new horde of monsters, dressed like the satellites of 
Pluto, grab the luckless mothers’ offspring one last and most ter- 
rible time, hack them to shreds with the poniard each wields, fling 
their remains at our feet, leap upon the women, whereof, in the 
center of the arena, they make the promptest and_ bloodiest 
slaughter; then, all covered with gore, spring into our midst, stab 
the fuckers lying in our arms, and themselves embugger us, roaring 
with pleasure. 


978 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘““What a scene!” [ say to Francavilla when, exhausted by 
fucking and horrors, we retire out of that charnel house; “what a 
rare and stirring spectacle!” ; 

“Your friend seem; not to have had her fill of it,” said the 
Prince, glancing back at Clairwil who was poking about the corpses 
heaping the battlefield, inspecting their wounds. 

“Fuck!” replied that woman of character, ‘think you one ever 
tires of the sight of death? Ever has enough of it? It was, to be 
sure, one of the most delicious horrors I’ve witnessed in all my days, 
but it is certain to leave me with an enduring sadness. For, alack, 
One cannot enjoy a massacre every fifteen minutes the whole length 
of one’s life.” 

And there the festive evening came to its close. Coaches were 
awaiting us. They conveyed us back to the Prince’s palace; we 
had hardly strength enough to hold ourselves upright; aromatic 
baths were ready, we slipped into them; hot broths were offered 
to us, and beds, and twelve hours later we were all three prepared, 
if need be, to begin agair. 


Rested from those mighty fatigues, we thought to pursue our 
circuit of outlying Naples, and to go down the easterly coast. If 
these descriptions do not please you, in amongst them I shall 
intersperse those of my lewd accomplishments; this variety amuses, 
it stimulates. Were these tales ever to be printed, the reader, his 
imagination heated by the lubricious details strewn throughout, 
would be enchanted, would he not, to be able to pause from time to 
time and dwell upon milder, more restful descriptions, framed 
nonetheless within the bounds of the strictest truth? 

The traveler’s eye, wearied by the grandiose scenery that 
gives him unremitting occupation while crossing the Alps, likes to 
linger upon the fertile plains into which he descends, gentle pros- 
pects where agreeable configurations of vine and elm seem every- 
where to suggest Nature in a festive spirit. 

And so, a week after our rout at the Prince’s, we set forth 
upon this second tour, with a guide provided by the King and all 
possible letters to ensure our kindly reception in the country we 
were going to traverse. 


Juliette & 979 


The first house we inspected with some thoroughness was 
Ferdinand’s castle of Portici. Hitherto, we had seen only its 
boudoirs. But it contained a museum; Ferdinand himself escorted 
us through it. Fourteen rooms all on one floor lodge this enormous 
collection, the world’s most curious and finest, I dare say. Nothing 
so tiring as an examination of its components; constantly on my 
feet, my mind straining, my eyes staring, it was all a blur by the 
time we had seen everything. 

In another part of the same castle we found greater enjoy- 
ment in the assortment of paintings recovered from Herculaneum 
and other towns buried by, the lava of Vesuvius. 

Generally speaking, in all these paintings one remarks a 
wealth of postures and attitudes which almost defy natural possi- 
bilities, and which testify either to great muscular suppleness in 
the inhabitants of those countries, or a great disorder of the 
imagination. Amongst other masterpieces I quickly distinguished a 
superb effort representing a satyr coupling with a goat: an aston- 
ishing work of art, beautiful in its conception, striking in its preci- 
sion of detail. 

“That fantasy is quite as agreeable as it is alleged to be ex- 
traordinary,” Ferdinand commented. “It is,” he went on to say, 
“much in usage hereabouts; as a Neapolitan, I was eager to ex- 
perience it, and I do not hide from you that it gave me the very 
rarest pleasure.” 

“T can believe it,” said Clairwil; ‘“‘many and many a time in 
my life I have thought of the idea, and I have never desired to be 
a man except to enact it.” 

“But, you know, a woman can perfectly well surrender herself 
to a large.dog,” the King reminded us. 

“Certainly,” I rejoined, in such a way as to suggest I was not 
totally unacquainted with that practice. 

“Charlotte,” pursued Ferdinand, “was of a mind to try it. 
It suited her to perfection.” 

“Sire,” said I, speaking so as to be heard by Ferdinand only, 
but with my customary frankness, “‘if all the princes of the House 
of Austria had but confined themselves to fucking goats, and if all 
the women of that House had conversed with bulldogs alone, the 
earth today would not be plagued with this accursed race, whereof 


980 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


its populations shall never be rid save through a general revolu- 
tion.” 

Ferdinand agreed chat I was quite right, and we moved on. 
Of Herculaneum’s thoroughly raided ruins there is little worth 
looking at today, and the site has been covered over to protect the 
ground Portici stands upon; one cannot well judge of the ancient 
theater, much disturbed by the diggings. When we returned to 
Portici, Ferdinand put us into the hands of the knowledgeable 
guide he had himself selected for us, and the amiable man wished 
us a fair journey, urging us to call upon his friend Vespoli, of 
Salerno, to whom he had given us letters of recommendation and 
under whose roof, he assured us, we would find capital entertain- 
ment. 

We went to Resina and thence took the road to Pompeii. Like 
Herculaneum, that city had been overwhelmed by ashes and lava, 
and in the course of the same great eruption. We noticed that 
Pompeii was itself built upon two more ancient towns, which had 
been visited by previous catastrophes. Vesuvius, as you see, is for- 
ever absorbing, destroying all that man has built in these parts, and 
yet man, undiscouraged, rebuilds again: but for this cruel enemy, 
the country surrounding.Naples would be the most agreeable on 
earth. 

From Pompeii we reached Salerno and lay overnight at the 
famous house of correction situated two miles outside that city, and 
in which Vespoli exercises his redoubtable superintendency. 

Vespoli, scion of one of the great families in the Kingdom 
of Naples, used once to te First Almoner at the Court. The King, 
whose pleasures he had served and whose conscience he had di- 
rected,** had accorded him the despotic administratian of the 
asylum where we found him. There, guaranteed by royal protec- 
tion, the libertine was free to indulge in everything his criminal 
passions might dictate. Atrocities being the warden’s specialty, 
Ferdinand was eager to have us be Vespoli’s guests. 

He was fifty years of age at the time, with an imposing and 


24It is the common practice in Italy to make one’s confessor one’s pimp; in 
high-ranking circles, these two offices are closely knit, and the priests, given a little 
to intriguing anyhow, usually exercise them admirably and simultaneously. 


Juliette & 981 


harsh physiognomy, tall, strong as a bull; he greeted us with 
marks of extremest consideration. He read the letters we presented 
and, since the hour was very advanced, promptly gave orders to 
have a supper and beds readied for us. It was Vespoli himself who 
brought us breakfast the next morning; and then, we having made 
known our wish to visit it, he led us on a tour of his establishment. 

Each of the rooms we were shown provided us infinite matter 
for criminally lewd reflections, and we were already horribly 
aroused by the time we reached the cages in which the crazed were 
kept. 

The superintendent, who up until now had done nothing but 
grow steadily warmer, was wearing an incredible erection when we 
stepped into this courtyard, and as fucking witless victims was 
what he most enjoyed, he asked us whether we cared to see him in 
action. 

‘By all means,” we replied. 

“I ask,” he said, “because my transports with these creatures 
are so prodigious, my proceedings so bizarre, my cruelties so ap- 
palling, that it does rather embarrass me to have my behavior in 
this place observed.” 

“Nonsense,” said Clairwil, ‘were your caprices a thousand 
times more incongruous, we would still wish to watch, and indeed 
we entreat you to act your wonted role as though you were all by 
yourself; and especially to deprive us of none of the precious 
idiosyncrasies without which we can obtain no true insights into 
your tastes and your soul.” 

“You merely intend to look on?” he inquired, rubbing his 
prick with emotion as he posed the question. 

“And why should we not also enjoy fucking these madmen?” 
Clairwil asked. “Your fantasies electrify us, we are eager to imi- 
tate all of them. I trust these subjects are not dangerous? No? 
Then we shall sport with them like you. But do not make us wait 
any longer, dear sir, I am burning to see you at work.” 

The cages were disposed around a large open court planted 
with tall cypresses through whose foliage there came a lugubrious 
green light, giving the place a graveyard look. In its center stood 
a cross studded with nails on one side; it was there the wicked 


982 «> THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Vespoli had his victims exposed. Four jailers, carrying spike- 
studded clubs a single blow of which could have slain an ox, es- 
corted us watchfully. Vespoli, accustomed to having them as on- 
lookers during his amusements, felt no awkwardness in their 
presence, and instructed two of them to stand by us while we 
witnessed the scene seated upon a bench at one side of the court- 
yard; the two other jailers were to loose from their cages those 
playthings the superintendent felt a need for. 

First to be set at large was a handsome young man, naked, a 
veritable Hercules, who cut a thousand strange capers as he came 
forth. One of the first of his extravagances was to squat before our 
feet and shit, and Vespoli came over to be on hand for this opera- 
tion, which he studied with care. He frigged himself, retrieved the 
turd, rubbed his prick upon it, and then falling to dancing about 
like the madman, to gamboling and frisking in the same way, he 
caught him from behind, pushed him up against the cross, and the 
guards tied him fast to it in an instant. Immediately the fellow is 
secured, Vespoli, ecstatic, kneels down before his ass, opens it, 
pants into it, tongues it, caresses it lovingly, then, getting quickly 
to his feet, takes a whip and for a long hour flays the unhappy and 
loudly screaming lunatic. Once his buttotks are in tatters, the lecher 
embuggers, and in his drunken condition, raves in tune with 
his victim. 

“Holy God Almighty,” the former almoner shrieks now and 
again, ‘‘what are the joys to be known in the asshole of a madman! 
And I too, I am mad, double-fucked Divinity; I bugger madmen, 
I discharge in madmen, I care for nought but them, I want to fuck 
nobody else in the world.” However, loath to squander his forces, 
Vespoli has the youth unbound. Another one rushes into the lists, 
this one fancies he is God. 

“I am going to fuck God,” Vespoli announces to us, “observe 
me; but I must give Gocl a thrashing before giving Him an em- 
buggering. Hither,” he continues, “this way, Bugger-God, bring 
Your ass around, Your ass, I say.” 

And God, attached to the stake by the jailers, is soon bested 
by His puny creature who embuggers Him once His buttocks are 
reduced to marmalade. A lovely girl of eighteen succeeds God; this 


Juliette & 983 


one takes herself for the Virgin. Further subject for the blas- 
phemies of Vespoli, who lashes the skin off the Blessed Mother of 
God, and who afterward sodomizes her for a quarter of an hour. 

Clairwil arises, all afire. 

‘This spectacle inspires me,” she says to us, ‘imitate me, my 
friends, and you, villain, have your jailers unclothe us and then 
lock us into those cages; treat us as though we were mad also, we 
shall feign lunacy; you will have us tied to the unspiked side of the 
cross, your madmen will whip us and then ass-fuck us.” 

The idea appeals to us all. Vespoli carries it out. Ten mad- 
men are unleashed against us; some of them flog us, others are 
hacked fairly to pieces for refusing to do so; but they all fuck 
us, and all, guided by Vespoli, fit themselves into our behinds. The 
guards, the warden, everybody has his turn, we are daunted by 
none of them. 

“So now discharge,” Clairwil says to the master of the house, 
“we have done everything you asked, show us how you behave 
during the dramatic moment.” 

“All in good time, in good time,” our man says, “‘there’s one 
here that puts me in seventh heaven; I never leave the house in 
the morning without first fucking him.” 

Upon a signal to one of his jailers, he is brought an old man 
of nearly eighty with a white beard growing down to his navel. 

“Come along, John,” Vespoli says, catching him by the beard 
and towing him the length of the courtyard, ‘‘pick up your feet, 
John, I am going to put my prick in your ass.” 

The venerable old man is bound and fustigated mercilessly ; 
his ass, his ancient, wrinkled ass is kissed, licked, embuggered; 
and withdrawing, very near to ejaculation, “Ah,” says Vespoli, 
“you want to see me discharge? But do you realize I never attain 
my crisis without it costing two or three of these unfortunate 
persons their lives?” 

“So much the better,” say I, ‘‘but I trust that in your massacres 
you will overlook neither God nor Mary, for I confess that I’d 
indeed discharge pleasantly seeing you assassinate the Good Lord 
with one hand and His daughter-in-law with the other.” 

“T ought then to be embuggering Jesus Christ in the mean- 


984 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


time,”’ said the infamous man. ‘‘And Christ, we have him here: 
all paradise is in this hell.” 

The jailers lead forth a handsome young man of some thirty 
years who called himself the Son of God, and whom Vespoli has 
afhxed to the cross at once. He flogs him with might and main. 

“Courage, good Romans,” the victim cries, “ever did I say 
unto you I came only to suffer on earth; spare me not, I implore 
you; well I know I must die upon the cross; but I shall have saved 
mankind.” 

At that, unable to restrain himself any longer, Vespoli puts 
prick to Jesus’ asshole, and takes a stiletto in either hand, there- 
with to regale the Holy Virgin and God the Father. 

“You others,” he calls to us, ‘come forward, stand near me, 
show me your asses, and since you are curious about my discharge, 
you shall soon see how J proceed with it.” 

He files away; never was the Son of God so stoutly fucked ; 
but each heave of Vespoli’s flanks is accompanied by a slash dealt 
to some part or another of the two bodies posted one to the left, 
the other to the right. First, they are arms, armpits, shoulders, 
flanks he stabs; as the crisis approaches, the barbarian aims his 
blows at more delicate parts; the Virgin’s bosom is covered with 
blood; striking now with one hand, now with the other, his arms 
move like a pendulum; the nearness of the spasm may be gauged 
by the sensitivity of the areas he brings under attack. Frightful 
oaths at last declare the onset of this frenetic’s final transports. 
His rage now singles out faces for its targets, he rips them with his 
knives, and when the last drops of sperm have left him, they are 
eyeballs he pierces. Is there any possible expressing to what degree 
we are animated by this spectacle? We are bent on imitating the 
monster; victims are furnished us in abundance; we each immolate 
three. Clairwill, gone wild with lust, leaps to the center of the 
courtyard, drawing Vespoli after her. 

“Fuck me, knave,” she says to him; “in consideration of the 
cunt belonging to a woman of your own breed, perform an act of 
infidelity to your faith.” 

“T cannot,” said the Italian. 

“T demand it.” 

We excite Vespoli, his device rises; we force it into Clairwil’s 


Juliette & 985 


womb. We exhibit our asses to him, the capricious fellow asks for 
madmen, and it is only by having one of them shit upon his face 
that the scoundrel, prodded and wrought upon by Olympia and 
me, at last sprays fuck into Clairwil. And we retire from that ex- 
ecrable den, where, hardly noticing the passage of time, we had 
spent thirteen whole hours wallowing in infamies. 

We tarried several days in Vespoli’s institution of crime and 
debauchery, and then, wishing the superintendent every kind of 
prosperity, resumed our way toward the famous temples of 
Paestum. 

Before going to inspect those monuments we first arranged 
for lodgings at a superb farm to which Ferdinand had addressed 
us. Graciousness, gentility characterized the persons we found 
upon this idyllic estate; it was owned by a widow of forty and her 
three daughters, who in age ranged from fifteen to eighteen. Here 
‘twas as though wickedness and crime did not exist: had virtue 
somehow been banished out of the world, it would have chosen this 
place for its retreat, and to be immortalized in the right-thinking 
and generous Rosalba. Wonderfully well preserved was she, and 
pretty beyond words were her daughters. 

“Ha,” I whispered to Clairwil, “did I not tell you I had a 
feeling we were soon to come upon an asylum where virtue in its 
purest colors would unfailingly provoke us to vice? Just look at 
those heavenly girls! they are flowers Nature presents for our 
plucking. Oh, Clairwil, it must be that thanks to us, trouble and 
desolation swiftly replace the innocence and the sweet peace reign- 
ing in this delicious place.” 

“My cunt throbs to hear you,” said Clairwil; “these are, as 
you say, affecting victims.” Then, after kissing me: “But their 
sufferings will not be mild. . .. However, let us first dine, then go to 
see the relics, and afterward devote ourselves to atrocity.” 

Traveling with a cook of our own we were assured of good 
fare wherever we stopped. After an ample meal, served us by the 
daughters of the house, we were shown the way to the temples. 
Those superb edifices are in a state of such excellent preservation 
that they do not appear to have been built more than three or four 
centuries ago. In number they are three, one of them being a good 
deal larger than the other two. After having contemplated these 


’ 


986 <<’ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


masterpieces, after having regretted that in every country of the 
world superstition has been responsible for the wasting of huge 
sums and efforts upon gods which, however recognized, have never 
existed save in the imzginations of fools, we turned back and 
headed for our farm, whither we were beckoned by equally inter- 
esting affairs. 

There, Clairwil accosted the mother and gave her to under- 
stand that we were afraid of sleeping alone in a so prodigiously 
isolated countryside. ‘“‘Your daughters,” the rascal wanted to know, 
‘‘dare we hope that they will accommodate us by sharing our beds ?” 

‘Of course, dear lady,” the good woman replied, “my daugh- 
ters are only too flattered by the honor you deign to show them.” 

And Clairwil havirg hastened to report to us this becoming 
reply, each of us selected the maiden we desired, and we retired for 
the night. 

The fifteen-year-old had fallen to me; nothing prettier, noth- 
ing.sweeter ever graced the world. No sooner were we underneath 
the same sheet than I set to plying her with caresses, and the poor 
little thing responded with a candor, an ingenuousness that might 
have disarmed anyone but a libertine of my stamp. I began by ques- 
tions. Alas, the innocent understood not one word; nor yet, warm 
though the latitude was, had Nature begun to speak in her, and the 
most entire simplicity alone dictated that angel’s artless replies. 
When my impure fingers touched the petals of the rose, she quiv- 
ered; I kissed her, she kissed me in return, but with a simplicity 
unknown to worldly folk, and to be encountered nowhere but in 
the bowers of modesty and chaste inexperience. 

There was nothing I might not have got her to do, nothing | 
might not myself have done with that pretty little creature when 
my companions, already up and stirring, came to find out how I had 
spent my night. 

“What am I to tell you? I venture to say that the tale of my 
pleasures would be an exact recounting of yours.” 

“Ah, fuck my soul,” said Clairwil, “I don’t believe I have 
ever discharged so heavily. But, Juliette, up with you, send that 
child away, there are things we must discuss.” 

Looking her hard in the eye, “Slut,” I said to her, “your 
soul stands revealed in your stare . . . crime lurks there.” 


Juliette 2% 987 


“T am resolved to commit one, dreadful, hideous. . . . You 
know, the welcome we have had from these good people, the 
pleasure the girls have given us... .” 

“Well ?” 

“I want to butcher them all, rob, plunder, burn down their 
house, and frig myself over its ruins once the corpses are buried 
underneath them.” 

“T find that a delightful idea,” said I. “But first let us spend 
an evening with the family: the mother and her daughters are 
alone, all the help have gone off to Naples, there is not another 
house for miles around . . . let us perform some infamies, after- 
ward we shall do our killing.” 

“So you are weary of yours?” 

“Mortally.” 

“For my part, I am ready to see mine in hell,” Borghese ad- 
mitted. 

“One ought never go too far with a pleasure-providing in- 
dividual,” said Clairwil, ‘unless one has poison in one’s pocket.” 

‘“Minx! But before we settle down to business let us first have 
a quiet lunch.” 

As escort we had four strapping valets membered like jack- | 
asses, who fucked us when we were in need of fucking and who, 
paid exorbitantly, would not have dreamed of disputing our in- 
structions: once told of our plan, they could hardly wait to put it 
into execution. Night had no sooner fallen than we took command 
of the house. But it is essential that I depict the actors to you, 
before detailing the scenes. Having already acquainted you with 
the mother, and described Rosalba’s unimpaired freshness and 
beauty, I have only to say a few words about her children. Isabella 
was the youngest, ’twas with her I had spent the previous night; 
the second was called Mathilda, she was sixteen, lovely features, 
evenness and languor in her gaze, the look of a Raphael virgin; and 
Ernesilla was the name of the eldest : Venus’ own bearing and body 
and face, impossible to be more beautiful: she was the one with 
whom Clairwil had just soiled herself in horrors and impudicities. 
Roger, Victor, Agostino, and Vanini were our lackeys’ names. The 
first of them belonged to me, he was from Paris, twenty-two, and 
his device was a marvel; Victor, also French and eighteen years 


988 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


old, belonged to Clairwil; his occult qualities were in no sense in- 
ferior to Roger’s. Agostino and Vanini, both Florentines, belonged 
to Borghese, they were both youthful, with charming faces, and 
superiorly membered. 

The gentle mothér of those three Graces, a little surprised by 
the precautionary measures she sees us taking, asks what this 
activity might mean. 

“You shall now find out, whore,” says Agostino, ordering her, 
his pistol leveled at her heart, to remove her clothes. In the mean- 
time our three other valets, each taking charge of one of the 
daughters, address to them compliments in the same kind. A few 
minutes later and the naked mother and daughters, their hands 
tied behind their backs, appear before us in the helpless situation 
of victims. Clairwil ste2s up to Rosalba. 

“Why, to look at this slut makes one’s mouth water,” says 
she, fondling Rosalba's buttocks, squeezing her breasts. “And 
these over here,” and she turns toward the girls again; “they are 
perfect angels, I have never set eyes on the like. Rascal!” she says 
to me, caressing my Isabella, “‘you got the best of the lot, what 
pleasures you must have had last night with this exquisite object! 
Well now, my friends, you'll entrust the direction of the ceremonies 
to me?” 

“Surely, for our interests could not be placed under more 
capable management.” 

‘““My suggestion then is that one after another we go into an 
adjoining chamber witt. the mother and her three daughters, and 
prepare the material for use.” 

“Shall we accompany ourselves by a man?” Borghese asked, 

“No men at the beginning; they will be included in later 
arrangements.” 

As I do’ not know what my companions did | shall tell you 
only of the pranks I played upon those four unfortunate creatures. 
I took a strap to the mother, held by her daughters; then to one of 
the latter, while the two others frigged their mother in front of 
me; I inserted needles in all their breasts, bit the clitoris and the 
tongue of each, and broke the little finger on everybody’s right 
hand. The blood streaming down their bodies when, later, my 
friends brought them back in seemed to indicate that Clairwil and 


Juliette 2 989 


the Princess had been just as severe as I. The preliminary exercises 
completed, we assembled our victims. They all wept. 

“Is this the reward for our politeness to you,” they sobbed, 
‘for the things we have done in your behalf ?” 

And the mother, in great distress, drew her daughters to her, 
kissed them, sought to console them; they nestled close to her, 
dropped their tears upon her bosom: the four composed a touching, 
a heart-rending tableau of sorrow and woe. But souls like ours, you 
know, do not readily melt, every appeal to their sensibility acts as 
further fuel to their rage: the whey ran down our thighs. 

‘“‘We shall now have them fuck,” Clairwil pronounced, ‘‘and 
for that, untie their hands.” 

With those words she places Rosalba upon a bed, then bids 
the youngest girl prepare our four valets’ pricks for her mother. 
Goaded by our threats, the poor child was obliged to stroke, to 
suck, generally to put in fettle the engines that were to sound her 
mother; while she was engaged at these chores, we frolicked with 
her sisters. Our men were warned against any intempestive dis- 
charging. We presented the eldest girl to them, and then ’twas the 
mother who had to prepare the pricks. This second attack was an- 
other great success: Rosalba’s children were one by one fucked by 
pricks formed for that purpose by her. One of our men, Agostino, 
weakened, however, and gasped forth his seed into Isabella’s cunt. 

‘‘Don’t be upset,” said Clairwil, taking him promptly in hand, 
“three minutes, my boy, and I shall have you as erect as you were a 
short while ago.” 

Asses are now brought to the fore, the sodomy begins with the 
mother, her daughters are compelled to dart the pricks into her 
anus; a little while later, she renders them the same service, Roger, 
the best-membered of the quartet, is appointed to depucelate young 
Isabella . . . he nigh cleaves her in two; we discharge, lubriciously 
frigged by the other girls and bum-fucked by the men. Here it was 
Vanini who lost his self-control, vanquished by the effects of 
Ernesilla’s splendid posterior: he filled her bowels with fuck, and 
Clairwil, with her unique skill for rehoisting fallen pricks, soon 
had that pretty fellow’s as hard as if it had been deprived of 
exercise for six weeks. 

At this point the true punishment began. Clairwil had the idea 


990 ¢& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of tying a girl on top of each one of us, and the mother, threatened, 
constrained by the valets, was to torment them as they lay upon 
our bodies. I had requested Ernesilla; Mathilda was upon Clair- 
wil, Isabella upon Borghese. Our men had all kinds of trouble 
getting obedience from Rosalba. When one must cajole Nature, 
when one must force a mother to whip, slap, cuff, pinch, burn, bite 
her own children, ’tis not, of course, an easy task. By it, however, 
we were not to be daunted. The whore required a great deal of 
pummeling but she complied, and we relished the ferocious pleasure 
of frigging, of kissing those three hapless creatures, fastened to us, 
while their mother beat them to a pulp. 

These were succeeded by more serious games. We attached the 
mother to a pillar and obliged, at pistol-point, each of the daugh- 
ters to thrust a sharp 1eedle into Rosalba’s breasts; they did so. 
Then we tied them, and it was the mother’s turn: there was no way 
out for her, she had to drive a dagger into each of their gaping 
cunts, and while she was carving we caressed her buttocks with 
firmly held stilettoes. Tose four bodies were approaching the state 
which distills that delicious horror engendered by the furtive crimes 
lewdness is the cause of, and which is not of the sort the ordinary 
sensibility can be expected to appreciate. Weary from work and 
pleasure, we had ourselves sodomized as we contemplated the 
ghastly condition of our victims, and while Roger, who had no 
woman to skewer, swung a steel-tipped martinet against those 
creatures, all four bound tight together in a solid mass. 

“Very well, by Ged, by bugger-fucking God, very well, let’s 
kill them now,” said Clairwil, whose homicidal eyes stared rage 
and lust; “‘let’s assassinate, let’s destroy, let’s drink their tears to 
drunkenness. I have waited long enough to see these whores expire, 
I am burning from the need to hear their death-cries, from a thirst 
for their accursed blood. I'd like to devour them piecemeal, to 
feed my guts on their rotten flesh. .. .” 

Thus spoke she; and the buggeress stabbed with one hand, 
worried her clitoris with the other. We imitated her; and those 
screams, those screams we so longed to hear, rose like a hymn in 
our ears. We were there, watching from close on; our valets 
socratized us during the operation; all our senses were thrilled 
simultaneously by the divine spectacle of our infamies. 


Juliette & 991 


I was at Clairwil’s side; frigged by Agostino, the slut was in 
the midst of discharging. She leaned toward me. “Oh, Juliette,” 
she exclaimed, redoubling her habitual blasphemies, “oh, beloved 
soul, how crime doth delight, how puissant are its effects! what a 
mighty grip hath its charms upon a sensitive spirit!” 

And the howls of Borghese, who for her part was discharging 
like a Messalina, precipitated our ejaculations and those of our 
lackeys, being briskly frigged by us. 

Our agitation having subsided, we devoted the ensuing mo- 
ment of repose to verifying the results of our criminal acts: the 
whores were sighing their last . . . and cruel death robbed us of 
the pleasure of torturing them some more. Hardly satisfied by the 
havoc we had just wrought, we turned our hands to pillaging the 
house, then we destroyed it. There are times in life when the desire 
to wallow in disorder is such as not to be sated by anything, and 
when execrations, even the most pronounced, only faintly fulfill an 
excessive inclination to evil.?° 

We walked away into the night, under a sky filled with stars. 
We had abandoned the plunder to our lackeys who were thereby 
to earn some thirty thousand francs from its resale. 

From Paestum we retraced our steps to Vietri, where we 
boarded a small vessel for Capri. It sailed an easy course, tacking 
frequently close in to the land, and enabling us to miss none of the 
picturesque sites along the sublime coast of that peninsula. We put 
in for lunch at Amalfi, ancient Etruscan town enjoying an incom- 
parable location. After that we landed again at Point Campanella, 
having followed a shore that remained extraordinary every mile. Of 
the Surrentines who lived here long ago we found only the remains 


25 Certain carping critics complained that, in Justine, we introduced only mascu- 
line villains onto the stage; here, thank heaven! we are in no danger of hearing the 
same withering reproaches. The truth, alas, is that evil-doing, one of the fundamental 
elements in the workings of Nature, is in an approximately equal degree manifest 
throughout the entire range of Nature’s creatures; the more sensitive an individual, 
the more sharply this atrocious Nature will bend him into conformance with evil’s 
irresistible laws; whence it is that women surrender to it more heatedly and perform 
it with greater artistry than men. But all, men and women alike, are wicked because 
they have to be: if in any of that there is anything absurd or unjust, it is the law 
made by the man who dares have the idictic and vain pretension of repressing or 
combating the law of Nature. 


992 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of a temple of Minerva. The weather being fair, we set sail and in 
two short hours, passinz the three little islands in the Galli group, 
we entered the port of Capri. 

The island of Capri, which must measure some ten miles 
around, is girt on all sides by the highest crags. The one harbor is 
the little port on the landward side, facing the Bay of Naples. In 
shape the island describes an ellipse four miles long by two at its 
greatest width; it is div ded into two parts, upper and lower Capri. 
A prodigiously high mountain makes for the division, acting as the 
Apennines do in Italy. Communication between the two parts is by 
a stairway of one hundred and fifty steps hewn in the face of sheer 
rock. 

Tiberius seldom climbed them; it was the lower part he pre- 
ferred, where the weatiier is more temperate, and it was there he 
built his pleasure domes and his palaces, one of which is, however, 
perched on the tip of a rock rising so far above the water that the 
eye can barely discern the fishermen’s boats moored below. That 
particular palace served as the theater for his most piquant lewd 
revels. "T'was from the summit of a tower poised on a spur of rock, 
and whose vestiges are still to be seen, that fierce Tiberius used to 
have children of both sexes flung to their death, once they were of 
no further use to his lust. 

“Fuck the devil,” Clairwil muttered, “how he must have dis- 
charged watching the victims of his libertinage plummet from 
these heights. Oh, dear angel,” she went on, hugging me to her, “‘he 
was a voluptuous rascal, that Tiberius. What if we were to look 
for something to throw off this precipice as the Emperor used to 
do?” 

And it was then that Borghese, guessing what was on our 
minds, pointed to a little girl of nine or ten who was tending a she- 
goat a short distance away. 

“Just what we want,” said Clairwil. “But our guides?” 

“They may be sent home. We need simply tell them that we 
have decided to take a rap here.” 

No sooner said than done; we find ourselves alone. Borghese 
herself fetches over the child. 

“Who are you?” we ask her. 

“Poor and destitute,” the little darling replies humbly. “This 


Juliette & 993 


goat is all we have and mother is sick and always in bed and if it 
weren't for the goat and for me, she would surely die.” 

‘‘Why, this is a rare stroke of good luck,” said the infernal 
Clairwil. ““We must tie the two of them together, goat and girl,.and 
send them over the edge.” 

“Quite right, but not before we amuse ourselves,” said I. “I 
for one am dreadfully curious to find out how this child is made; 
health, freshness, innocence glow in her young charms: it would be 
ridiculous not to divert ourselves with them.” 

And will you believe it, my friends? Yes, we had the cruelty 
to take that child’s maidenhead, which was accomplished with a 
pointed stone; to flay her with brambles which we found growing 
near at hand; next, to bind her to her nanny and to push them both 
over the edge ‘of the precipice, and to watch them fall and disappear 
into the sea; and what lent their acuteness to our three discharges 
was the knowledge that the murder was twofold, since we were also 
causing the death of the child’s infirm mother who, deprived of the 
resources represented by the two objects we had just destroyed, 
would surely not fail to perish in her turn. 

“That is how I like my horrors,” I declared to my friends; 
“either make them thorough and extensive, or refrain from under- 
taking them at all.” 

“Yes,” Clairwil agreed, “but it would have been good to have 
asked the child where her mother lives. For it would have been 
delightful to see her expire from want.” 

“Roguish thing!” I said to my friend, ‘I wager there is not a 
person on earth able to boast of your capacities for refining a 
crime.” 

And we continued our promenade. 

Most eager to learn whether the happy inhabitants of this 
island resembled, through vigor as regarded the men, through 
charms as regarded the women, Naples’ divine breed, we betook 
ourselves to see the Governor, and delivered to him a personal 
letter from Ferdinand. . 

Having read it, ‘I am surprised,” said he, “that the King 
could have thought to issue me such instructions. Can he be unaware 
that my position here is more that of a spy set to watch these people 
than of a representative of the Crown? Capri is a republic of which 


994 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the royally appointed governor is merely the president. By what 
right would His Majesty have me compel these citizens, men and 
women, to surrender themselves to you? A despot’s orders, these, 
and. Ferdinand knows full well he is not the despot-here. I too am 
fond of all such things, but find little opportunity to indulge in 
them hereabouts, where there are no public whores and precious 
few idlers or valets; nevertheless, as, according to what Ferdinand 
writes, you pay liberally, I am going to propose to a merchant’s 
widow of my acquaintance that she let you have her three daugh- 
ters. She likes money and I do not doubt but that she will be 
seduced by yours. These daughters, born on Capri, are one of them 
sixteen years of age, another seventeen, the eldest twenty; we have 
nothing more beautiful upon the entire island; what is your offer?” 

“A thousand ounces a head,” said my friend, ‘funds disbursed 
for our pleasures’ sake do not come out of our own pockets, and 
to you, Governor, we promise an equal sum. But in addition we 
must get us three males.” 

‘Shall I receive the same fee for them?” asked the greedy 
public officer. 

‘Certainly. We are: not people to higgle over such matters.” 

And the dear man having readiéd everything for the lewd 
scene in the offing, asked nothing more in the way of favors save 
leave to watch it. 

The girls were in truth splendid; the boys, healthy, vigorous, 
and endowed with magnificent pricks. After having had our 
thorough fill of them, we mated them with our three virgins; we 
assisted in the deflowerings; however, the plucking of the rose was 
all we allowed them; they were then obliged to take refuge in our 
asses, they had permission to discharge nowhere else. The spectacle 
had the poor Governor in an ecstasy, and he applauded it by 
masturbating nearly to unconsciousness: for these orgies were pro- 
longed throughout the entire night, and in such a country we dared 
not pass the time otherwise than in anodyne ceremonies. We left 
without going to bed, after having paid the Governor handsomely, 
and promised to present his excuses to Ferdinand for not having 
done more for us, restricted as he was by the islanders’ mode of 
government. 

Sailing back to Naples, our vessel coasted close to the land, 


Juliette % 995 


for we remained spellbound by the sights along those wonderful 
shores. We discovered Massa, Sorrento, Torquato Tasso’s home, 
the lovely grotto of Lila de Rico, and finally Castellammare. There 
we put in to port to visit Stabiae, buried like Herculaneum, where 
Pliny the Elder used to go to see his friend Pompeianus, in whose 
house he was lying the night of the famous eruption which sub- 
merged that town along with the others round about. The work- 
men excavating this one are proceeding slowly: when we were 
there, they had unearthed only a handful of buildings. 

It was a rapid tour we made, weary as we were; and very 
eager to rest and refresh ourselves, we returned at last to our 
princely quarters, sending word to the King notifying him we were 
in the city again, and thanking him for all he had done to make our 
journey such a success. 


few days later we received a message from His Neapolitan 

Highness, inviting us to be among his guests on the bal- 

corny of the royal palace to witness one of his kingdom’s most 

unusual festivals. It was the one known as The Treat. I had fre- 

quently heard tell of this extravagance; but the actual thing was 
unlike anything I could have expected. 

Charlotte and Ferdinand were awaiting us in a boudoir whose 
windows looked out upon the square where the holiday tumults 
were to occur. Among us were two other personages, La Riccia 
arid the Duc Gravines, a man of fifty, very libertine. 

“If you are not familiar with this entertainment,” said the 
King after we had finished dinner, ‘‘you are apt to find it rather 
primitive.” 

“That, Sire, and barbarous is how we like our entertainments,” 
I replied; ‘and I shall add that I have long favored reviving rough 
sports and gladiatorial combats in France: a nation’s tone is main- 
tained by bloody spectacles; where these lack, you are heading 
for decadence. When a thoughtless emperor, placing stupid Chris- 
tianity on the throne of the Caesars, closed the circuses at Rome, 
what did the masters of the world turn into, eh? Abbots, monks, 
or dukes.” 

“I feel just as you do,” said Ferdinand. “My aim is to revive 
contests between men and animals, and even those pitting men 
against men; it is in that direction I have been moving; Gravines 
and La Riccia support me, and I hope we shall succeed.” 

“And of what account can the lives of all that trash be,” 
‘Charlotte wondered, “when our pleasures are at stake? If we 
have the right to have their throats cut for our interests’ sake, I 
see no reason why we cannot do the same for the sake of our 
delights.” : 

“Very well, gentle ladies,” Ferdinand said to us, “issue your 


999 


1000 <f THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


orders. Depending upon the greater or lesser degree of rigor, upon 
the larger or smaller number of police I introduce into these orgies, 
I can have six hundred more or fewer people killed: therefore 
indicate what your desires are in this regard.” 

“The worst, the worst,” Clairwil was prompt to answer; “‘the 
more of those rascals you have dispatched, the better you will 
divert us.” 

Ferdinand then mu:mured some instructions to one of his 
officers. 

A cannon boomed; and we proceeded out onto the balcony. 
There was an excessively numerous crowd collected upon the 
square; from our vantage point we had the clearest view of every- 
thing. 

Ups a huge scaffolding decorated with rustic ornaments is 
heaped a tremendous quantity of victuals so disposed as to compose 
a part of the decoratior. Inhumanely crucified there are geese, 
chickens, turkeys, which, suspended alive and held by a single nail, 
amuse the people by their twitchings and flutterings; loaves of 
bread, dried cod, quarters of beef; sheep, grazing on an artificial 
pasture, tended by pasteboard shepherds; upon a sea made of can- 
vas, a vessel laden with food or useful articles intended for the 
populace. Such, laid out with much artistry and tastefulness, is 
the bait prepared for this savage nation, all in order to com- 
memorate and to perpetuate its voraciousness and its excessive pro- 
pensity for theft. For, after having witnessed this sight, it would 
be difficult not to agree tiat it is more an exercise in pillage than 
a veritable festival. 

We had hardly time to consider the theater for the forth- 
coming events when a second shot was heard. At this signal, the 
cordon of troops that has been holding the crowd back suddenly 
gives way; the people rush forward and, in the twinkling of an eye, 
everything is made off with, snatched up, grabbed away, with a 
swiftness, with a frenzy impossible to describe. This terrifying 
scene, resembling the fleshing of a pack of hounds, regularly ends 
more or less tragically because disputes break out, everybody covets 
what his neighbor has just got his hands upon; and, in Naples, 
such differences are always settled with drawn knives, But this 


Juliette & 1001 


time, in accordance with our desires and thanks to Ferdinand’s 
foresight, once the scaffoldings were black with people, once they 
looked to be covered with a good seven or eight hundred struggling 
human beings, the structure abruptly collapsed, and over four 
hundred people were crushed. 

“Ah, fuck!” exclaimed Clairwil, sinking giddily upon a sofa, 
“ah, my friends, you gave me no warning of this—I am dying—”’ 
and it was to La Riccia the whore appealed, ‘‘—fuck me, my angel, 
fuck me,” she sighed, “I am discharging; in all my life nothing I 
have ever been witness to has given me such pleasure.” 

We re-entered the boudoir; windows and doors were shut, 
and the most delicious of all lubricious scenes was enacted, as it 
were, upon the ashes of the unfortunate plebeians sacrificed by 
high wickedness. 

Four girls, fifteen or sixteen years old, lovely as daylight and 
dressed in the black crepe of mourning, naked underneath it, were 
awaiting us, standing, and in silence. In another part of the room, 
four other women, between twenty and thirty, each pregnant, each 
stark naked, silent also, and wearing grave expressions, seemed 
eager to hear our instructions. Reclining upon a couch at the room’s 
far end were four young men, between eighteen and twenty years 
old, and in their hands they held their threatening pricks, and those 
pricks, good friends, those pricks were monsters: twelve whole 
inches in circumference, yes, and eighteen inches long. Not in all 
our lives had we beheld the like of those objects; and the four of 
us discharged merely at catching sight of them. 

“These four women and these four girls,” Ferdinand ex- 
plained to us, “are the daughters and the widows of some of the 
ill-starred individuals who perished a short while ago before our 
eyes. Those individuals were, I can affirm, in positions of particular 
- danger when the disaster was produced, and of their deaths I am 
certain. I had these eight women summoned here well before 
today’s Treat began and, locked inside a room, through a window 
they were able to witness the fate of their fathers and husbands. 
I turn them over to you now, with them conclude your holiday. 
Out there,” the monarch continued, opening a door giving out 
upon a little garden, “out there is the pit dug for their remains 


1002 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


when they have at last, after hideous sufferings, earned the right 
to rest in peace. Their grave. ... Women, step this way, you must 
see it too.” 

And the cruel man obliged them to climb down into the trench, 
made them lie down in it, then, satisfied with its dimensions, he 
directed our attentions back to the four youths. 

“I am certain, Mesciames,” said he, “that you have not often 
beheld such articles.” And he took hold of those awesome pricks, 
hard as iron bars, and had us feel. them, heft them, kiss them, 
dally with them. “The vigor of these men,” the King went on, “at 
least equals their superiority of member; every one of them is the 
guarantee. of fifteen or sixteen discharges, and not one yields less 
than twelve ounces of sperm per ejaculation: they are the élite in 
my realm. They are Calabrians all four, and there is no province 
in Europe that furnishes members of this size. Let us enjoy them 
without stint. 

‘Four boudoirs adjon this one; they are outfitted with every- 
thing that can serve lustf.l purposes: so let us be off, let us fuck 
and be fucked, let us vex, torment, torture to our hearts’ content, 
and may our imaginations, fired by the spectacle that has just been 
staged for us, ensure the thoroughness of cruelties and the refine- 
ment of our joys.” 

“Bugger-fuck!” I said to Ferdinand, ‘“thow nicely you have 
the art of entertaining persons of our temper.” 

Dresses, petticoats, »reeches fell quickly to the floor, and 
before proceeding to collective scenes, it appeared to be every- 
body’s intention to repair singly into the neighboring rooms for a 
short moment. La Riccia took with him one of the girls, a pregnant 
woman, and a fucker; Gravines encloseted himself with Olympia 
and an expectant mother; and Ferdinand took Clairwil, a fucker, 
another expectant mother, and two little girls; Charlotte chose me, 
and wanted to have a pair of fuckers with us, one of the girls, and 
a woman as well. 

“Juliette,” the Queen of Naples addressed me as soon as we 
were inside our boudoir, “I can no longer keep to myself the 
emotions you have engendered in me: I adore you. I am too much 
a whore to promise you fidelity; but that romantic sentiment is of 


Juliette & 1003 


course valueless amongst such persons as ourselves: ’tis not a heart 
I offer you, ’tis a cunt, a cunt which pours fuck whenever your hand 
touches it. In you I see someone of my own mind, of my own way 
of thinking, and, incontestably, I prefer you to either of your sisters. 
Your Olympia is a clod, she shows some mettle occasionally, but the 
rest of the time she is timorous and at bottom she is a coward; 
a clap of thunder would suffice to convert such a woman. Clairwil, 
yes, she is a superb creature, with infinite wit, I don’t deny it, but 
her tastes and mine are not at all the same: for exercising her 
cruelties she likes men only, and while I am willing enough to 
sacrifice that sex, it is however the blood of mine I most enjoy 
shedding. She adopts, besides, an overbearing and superior manner 
toward us all, and it is prodigiously hurtful to my pride. With no 
fewer resources and perhaps with many more than she, you, Juliette, 
do not affect so much vanity; that comforts; I believe there is more 
sweetness in your character, just as much wickedness in your head, 
but in your heart a greater capacity for loyalty toward your friends. 
In short, I like you best, and this diamond, worth fifty thousand 
crowns, which I beg you to accept, may persuade you it is so.” 

“Charlotte,” said I, declining to take the gem, “‘you are a 
woman to whom one may confess having vices; I am touched by 
your feelings in my regard, and mine for you, be sure of it, are 
the same. But I shall own to you, my dear, and it is one of my 
idiosyncrasies, I accord no importance whatever to gifts, only 
what I take counts in my eyes. And if you care to satisfy me on 
that head, why, you can do so very easily.” 

“How?” 

“Before anything else, swear by your love for me that you 
will never tell anyone of the imperious desire that devours me.” 

“T swear to it.” 

‘I want to steal your husband’s treasures, to that end I want 
you to provide me the means.” 

“Lower your voice,” said the Queen, “these people could 
overhear us. One moment, I shall send them into the next room. 

‘‘Now,” Charlotte continued once we were alone, “we may 
chat in security. I have a proposal to make to you; accept it, there 
is no other way for you to convince me of the sincerity of your 


1004 — THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


feelings in my regard. Oh, Juliette!” she added, “the trust you place 
in me demands that I in return place mine in you. And I too, my 
dear, I am meditating a. crime; will you help me?” 

“Even were it at tie risk of a thousand lives. Speak.” 

“If you but knew how bored I am with my husband!” 

“Despite his indulgence ?” 

“Ts it for my sake he behaves as he does? He prostitutes me 
out of libertinage, out of jealousy; thus appeasing my passions, 
he reckons to forestall the birth of desires in me, and he prefers 
that it be through his will and choice I am fucked rather than 
through my own.” 

“A droll policy.” 

“It is the one he practices, it is that of an Italianized Spaniard, 
and there is nothing worse on the face of the earth.” 

“And you desire. ...” 

“To poison this tiresome man, to become regent once he is 
out of the way. The people prefer me to him, they adore my 
children; and I shall rule alone; you shall become my favorite, 
and your fortune is made.” 

“No, Charlotte, I shall not live with you, I am not attracted 
by the role you offer me: in addition, I am fond of my own country 
and am eager to return there soon. But you may rely upon my aid, 
since Ferdinand, who ha3 a store of poisons of every sort, doubtless 
keeps them out of your reach. From me you shall have what you 
need; but a good turn in exchange for a good turn, Charlotte, bear 
in mind that what I promise is yours only provided I get your 
husband’s treasure. What does it amount to?” 

“It cannot exceed eighty million.” 

“In currencies?” | 

“In ingots as well as in piasters, ounces, and sequins.” 

“How do we proceed ?” 

“You see that window,” said Charlotte, pointing to a case- 
ment window not far from the one at which we were standing, 
“have a wagon with some good horses underneath it the day after 
tomorrow; I shall steal the key and hand everything down to you 
in sacks.”’ 

“And the watch?” 

‘‘No sentinels are posted on this side.” 


’ 


Juliette & 1005 


“Listen,” I said to Charlotte, whose undoing I was excitedly 
plotting at that very moment, “there are steps I must take in order 
to obtain the poison you require, and I do not care to venture into 
this delicate matter unless I am sure of where I stand. Sign this 
paper,” said I, writing it out on the spot, “I shall then feel safe 
in acting, and neither of us will have anything further to worry 
about.” 

Blinded by her love for me, pressed by the extreme desire to 
be rid of her husband, Charlotte signed; and, signing, proved that 
prudence is rarely the consort of great passions. Herein as follows 
is the text she ratified: 


I shall steal all my husband’s treasure, and give it in payment to 
her who supplies me the poison necessary to send him to the next 
world. 

C.deL.,Reg.N. 


“Excellent,” said I, “that puts me entirely at ease. The day 
after tomorrow, at the hour fixed, you may count upon the wagon. 
Serve me well, Charlotte; and so shall you be served in return. 
Now let us turn to play.” 

‘Ah, dearest friend,” cried the Queen, overwhelming me with 
kisses, ‘‘what services you render me and how I adore you!” 

The fool! how far from reciprocal were my feelings. Oh, 
it was no longer possible to maintain the illusion, we had shed 
overmuch fuck together; I delighted only in the thought of her 
doom, and the document to which she had thoughtlessly put .her 
_ name guaranteed it. 

“Shall we frig each other,” she said, “before calling in the 
accessories to our debauchery ?” 

And without waiting for me to answer, the whore pushes me 
upon a bed, kneels between my thighs and sucks me, the while 
tickling my cunt and my asshole both at once. "T'was then I availed 
myself of the faculty women have for mental infidelities; it was 
from Charlotte I was receiving voluptuous sensations, I was 
covered by her pollutions, her kisses, and yet no thought absorbed 
me save that of betraying Charlotte. 

Adulterous wives, there is your portrait: lying in your hus- 
bands’ arms, to your master you abandon only the bodily part of 


1006 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


yourselves, and the sensations that arise in you are never but a 
response to your lover. The cuckolds delude themselves, supposing 
they are the cause of the raptures into which their motions plunge 
you, when actually, rub as much as they please, they are incapable 
of igniting even a spark. Bewitching sex, continue this deceit, it is 
natural; proof thereof resides in the suppleness of your imagina- 
tions; compensate yourselves thus, when you cannot do otherwise, 
for the preposterous chains of chastity and of wedlock, and never 
lose sight of the fact that if Nature made you a cunt for men to 
fuck, her hand at the very same instant created you the heart 
needed to betray them. 

Charlotte waxed drunk on my sperm, and I must honestly 
avow that it spilled forth in floods at the idea, delicious for a 
mind like mine, of forever ruining her who was responsible for 
its outpouring. She flings herself upon my breast, we pollute each 
other with ardor, she sucks my mouth, my nipples, and as I frig her 
to perfection, the tribade is shaken by twenty spasms in a row. 
We entwine ourselves, «ach buries her face between the other’s 
legs; tongue to clitoris, libertine finger in asshole and cunt, we sot 
ourselves upon each other’s fuck, all the while preoccupied by very 
dissimilar thoughts. 

Finally, Charlotte, all afire, is in a mood for libertinage, she 
rings, she would have me be the center of everything at first; the 
pregnant woman, within reach of my right hand, is offered to my 
vexations; the girl, straddling my chest, simultaneously offers me 
the sweetest cunt to lick. and the most charming ass. Charlotte 
excites the pricks and herself pilots them into me. 

‘I am infatuated by the idea of having a queen for my bawd,” 
I declare to Charlotte; “yo to it, whore, ply your trade.” 

But engines of the size of those Ferdinand has procured for 
us are not easy to accommodate; and however veteran may be my 
charms, I am unable to endure, without preparation, such mon- 
strous attacks. Charlotte therefore moistens the thoroughfares; 
to the entrance of my cunt and to the fucker’s gargantuan member 
she applies an ointment thanks to which, at the first lunge, the 
monster is able to pass to the midway mark. However, the pain is 
so sharp that, expelling a furious cry, I send flying the little girl who 
has been perched above my chest; I struggle, thrash, seek to rid 


Juliette & 1007 


myself of the shaft. My efforts are countered by Charlotte, she 
pushes us together, my fucker and me, and thus aided, the hero 
thunders to the farthermost depths of my womb: I had never 
suffered so much. But these thorns are soon transformed into 
roses ; such is my rider’s skillfulness, such the power of his strokes, 
that at the fourth heave of his loins my fuck answers, and from 
then on everything moves smoothly. Charlotte, favoring the act, 
stimulating the organs and the asshole of my fucker, to my left 
hand offers her buttocks, which I molest with quite as much violence 
as I do those of the pregnant woman, and the little girl, tongued 
by me, splashes her dulcet ejaculation upon my face. What energy 
in that Calabrian! He saws me for twenty minutes, finally erupts, 
and refucks me three more times without retiring from the lists; I 
put him aside after an hour of this. His comrade replaces him. 
While I am fucking with this second one, Charlotte decides she 
would like to see both of them in my body. She arranges our posi- 
tions. I am in the second fucker’s arms, stretched out on top of him, 
tis I who do the fucking while he lies quietly still; I handle, I mal- 
treat a cunt with my right hand, my left is socratizing an ass, my 
tongue is licking a clitoris. The first man, assisted by the Queen, pre- 
sents himself at my asshole; but habituated though I am to this 
mode of pleasure-taking, we battle for a quarter of an hour, without 
his succeeding in making the least headway into the breach. These 
multiple efforts cause me an incredible agitation: I gnash my teeth, 
foam at the mouth, I bite everything I can get at, I drench with 
fuck the prick ploughing my cunt, ’tis upon that prick I vent my 
wrath at being unable to incorporate another one anally. By dint 
of perseverance and cunning, it is nevertheless beginning to 
progress, I feel it; my encunter stirs from his passivity, contributing 
a heave of the loins to facilitate his comrade’s task. I utter a 
piercing scream, I am embuggered. . . . It beggared comparison 
with anything I had ever experienced previously. 

‘What a divine spectacle!” cried Charlotte, masturbating 
smartly in front of us, and sometimes bending near to kiss me. 
“Christ! what an aperture! Happy Juliette!” 

And I discharged, and I was like one run amuck, I lost sight 
of everything, was deaf to everything, all my powers of sensation 
had concentrated in my erotic regions; I belonged uniquely to joy. 


1008 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Both my men, without withdrawing, simultaneously fought another 
fierce bout, and when I dislodged them, fuck covered me down to 
the heels, it seeped from my pores. 

“Your turn, slut,” [ say to Charlotte, “duplicate what I have 
just done if you care to know the meaning of pleasure.” 

She requires little urging; promptly stuffed before and behind, 
the jade proves to me that if her husband has been allowing her 
a few amusements, with a view to placating a libertinage which 
might pose dangers to his own safety, he has not been entirely 
wrong. Like us cruel in her voluptuous moments, the bitch asks me, 
while she cunt-sucks the little girl and is being fucked in cunt and 
ass, to tease the pregnant woman. That poor soul implores my 
mercy; I am not to be moved. Angered and heated by lewdness, 
I bring my knee up agaiast her stomach, she totters backward and 
falls, I leap and stamp upon her belly; then I beat her, I throttle 
her; watching it all, Charlotte eggs me on, stammering forth 
horrors. Having got herself double-fucked twice, the whore at last 
dismisses the men, and r:ses. We quaff off two bottle of champagne 
and pass back into the salon where we find all the company already 
gathered. Everybody was relating his prowesses; it was easy to 
deduce that it had not been in our boudoir alone that pregnant 
women had met with abuse: not one of them was able to hold 
herself upright; Gravines’ especially . . . she was about to enter 
labor; and the villain had flogged her half to death. 

Dinner was magnificent in the extreme; the girls waited upon 
us at table, and the pregnant women, lying on the floor beneath 
our feet, were the targets of all kinds of hard treatment. Seated 
next to Clairwil, I found the opportunity to mention to her the 
trick for which I had laid the groundwork; although I could give 
her only one or two details, she perfectly grasped my design, 
congratulated me, afirmed that I was the cleverest and the most 
venturesome woman she knew. 

Electrified by the delicate fare and the exquisite wines, we 
removed, tipsily, to a superb hall readied for the orgies that we 
needed to celebrate. There, the agents were Ferdinand, Gravines, 
La Riccia, Clairwil, Charlotte, Olympia, and myself. The victims: 
the four pregnant women, the four young girls who had waited 
upon us at dinner, and the eight comely children in the one sex 


Juliette & 1009 


and the other whose asses had dispensed the brandies which fol- 
lowed coffee. Fourteen stout warriors, at least as grandly pro- 
portioned, as high-strung as those we had drained in the morning, 
appeared, their lances couched; they were all naked, quivering, and 
respectfully, with bated breath, awaiting the laws it would please 
us to decree in their regard. The stage required to be lit, since 
we had tarried long at table and the hour was advanced: five 
hundred candles, hid by green gauze shades, produced a soft and 
most agreeable light throughout that hall. 

‘‘No more privacy, no more intimate conversation,” said the 
King; “henceforth we must operate within full view of one 
another.” 

Thereupon, in the most anarchical fashion, we fling ourselves 
at the nearest object to hand: we fuck, have fucked, are fucked:; but 
cruelty always presides over lewd doings as disorderly as ours. 
Here, breasts were being kneaded and wrung; there, asses were 
being lashed; to the right cunts were being stretched, gravid women 
were being martyrized to the left, and moans and sighs of pain 
or of pleasure, mingled with lamentations to one side, with awful 
blasphemies to the other side, were for a good while the only sounds 
to be heard. Little by little, however, the more energetic outbursts 
heralding discharges began to ring forth; Gravines was the first to 
utter his yell. Alas! no sooner had he pronounced the expressions 
announcing his delirium than we saw fall at his feet, in the middle of 
the swirling groups surrounding him, a woman, her throat cut, the 
fruit torn from her womb, and mother and child bathed both in 
blood. 

“That is not my way of going about it,” said La Riccia, order- 
ing one of those swollen sows to be tied fast to the wall. “Your 
attention, if you please,” said he, ‘‘kindly watch.” 

He dons a pair of hobnailed boots, places his hands on the 
shoulders of two men and catapults himself feet first at the belly 
of the would-be mother who, her seams split, rent, bloodied, faints 
in her bonds and looses her worthless fruit, upon which the lustful 
nobleman straightway sprays his foaming seed. Very close to the 
spot where this occurred, being fucked at once frontwise and from 
behind, sucking the device of a youth who chose this moment to dis- 
charge into my mouth, frigging a cunt with either hand, I could 


1010 <: THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


not help but share the Prince’s pleasures, and after his example I 
surrendered my sperm. Doing so, I cast a glance at Clairwil: some- 
one was embuggering her; a young girl was sucking her cunt and the 
slut was flogging a little boy; she too discharges. Charlotte, en- 
cunted, was sucking a little boy, frigging a couple of girls, and was 
having a pregnant woman flogged upon the belly. Ferdinand was 
Operating upon a girl: he was plucking at her parts with red-hot 
pincers; he was being sucked apace, and when he sensed his dis- 
charge near, the villain, armed with a scalpel, sliced off his victim’s 
nipples and tossed them at us. Such, roughly speaking, were our 
pleasures when Ferdinand suggested that we move into an adjoining 
chamber where an ingenious machine, said he, was ready to put the 
pregnant women to an interesting death. The two of them who are 
left are in consequence afhxed to large steel plates, one woman fac- 
ing upward, the other facing downward, in such sort that their 
bellies are in exact perpendicular line: the upper plate is elevated 
ten feet above the lower. 

‘All right,” says the King, “make ready for pleasure.” 

Everyone presses around, and several minutes later Ferdinand 
touches a lever, and the two plates, one rising, the other descending, 
come together with such force that the two creatures, colliding, are, 
they and their fruit, shortly squashed to a pulp. You will, I trust, 
have no trouble understanding that not one of those present was 
able to resist this spectacle, not one who did not salute it with a fuck 
and other expressions of divine praise. 

“Shall we move on to another room?” said our amiable host. 
“Other joys may be awaiting us elsewhere.” 

This enormous hall was occupied by a vast theater; seven 
different sets of equipment for inflicting that many varieties of death 
were in a state of readiness there; four torturers, each naked and 
handsome as Mars, stood by to administer each torture, the first of 
these being fire; the second, the whip; the third, the rope; the 
fourth, the wheel; the fifth, the pale; the sixth, decapitation; the 
seventh, general dissection. Each guest was provided with a sep- 
arate loge containing a gallery of fifty portraits of children, boys 
and girls, all as pretty as one could hope to see. We assumed our 
individual places, each accompanied by a fucker, a little girl, and 


Juliette -» 1011 


a little boy, whose functions were to minister to our pleasures dur- 
ing the executions. Next to each portrait hung a silken cord acti- 
vating a bell. 

“Each shall, in his turn, select a victim from among the fifty 
representations surrounding him,” Ferdinand announced; “he shall 
ring the bell corresponding to the object of his choice, his victim 
shall appear immediately in his loge; he shall dally with that victim 
for a moment. You will notice that from each loge a staircase leads 
up to the stage; preliminaries over, the guest shall march his victim 
up, direct him to the torture he deems most arousing, then inflict 
it himself, if he cares to; otherwise, he shall-signal to the torturer 
in charge, and the victim, taken promptly in hand by that officer, 
shall be sacrificed before his eyes. But for your pleasures’ sake I 
urge you not to act save one by one: we have no need to hurry, dear 
guests, and life’s best spent hours are always those one spends wrest- 
ing life away from others.” 

“Damn me,” Clairwil said to the King, “if I have often en- 
countered an imagination so fertile as yours.” 

“Oh,” rejoined the Neapolitan, “‘mine is a claim to only very 
modest glory. All these fantasies used to raise the pricks of my fore- 
bears, those tyrants of ancient Syracuse. In my archives I un- 
covered traces of these horrors, studied them, for they impressed 
me in the most favorable sense; I enjoy reviving tradition with my 
friends.” 

Gravines rings first; his choice falls upon a youth of sixteen, 
superb to see. The boy appears, and Gravines, who has sole rights 
to the use of him, whips him, sucks him, bites his member, crushes 
one of his testicles, embuggers him, and finally sends him off to be 
burned: as a sodomite, the sarcastic Duke declares, it is only fitting 
that he perish by fire. Clairwil rings next and, needless to say, her 
choice also settles upon a male: he was scarcely eighteen years old, 
he was as fair as Adonis; the wicked soul sucks, frigs, fustigates 
him, has him lick her cunt and ass; then, springing up to the stage 
with him, the buggeress impales him with her own hands, having 
herself embuggered by one of the torturers in the meantime. 

Olympia’s turn follows; a thirteen-year-old girl is the object 
she chooses. She caresses her, arid has her hanged. 


1012 «<& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


After her comes Ferdinand. Like Clairwil, he chooses a youth. 
“I am fond of torturing women,” he explains, “‘but I take even 
greater pleasure in killing individuals of my sex.” 

The adolescent appears: twenty years of age, membered like 
Hercules, with the face of Love. Ferdinand has himself tupped, 
tups in return, flagellates his victim, conducts him to the apparatus 
upon which he is to be broken. Broken, the victim is strapped to 
a wheel and left to expire there, at the rear of the stage. 

La Riccia’s fancy is caught by a maid of sixteen, lovely as the 
Goddess of Youth, and after having subjected her to all manner 
of abominations, he has her chopped up into small pieces. 

Charlotte rings for a little girl of twelve, and once she is done 
frolicking with her, the Queen, while being fucked by two men, has 
the child beheaded. 

I summon an eighteen-year-old girl, superb; never in my life 
had I feasted my eyes on a more beautiful body. After having 
kissed, fondled, licked every part of it, I lead her upon the stage; 
and working in concert with the executioners, I give her the whip. 
Tis no commonplace whip, but a formidable bullwhip, each stroke 
brings away a chunk of flesh the size of your hand; she expires, 
and her torturers fuck me as ] lie upon her corpse. 

So pleasant did we find this game that it had inevitably to be 
played for a very long time. All told, we immolated eleven hundred 
and seventy-six victims, which made one hundred sixty-eight apiece, 
among them six hundred girls and five hundred seventy-six boys. 
Charlotte and Princess Borghese were the only ones who sacrificed 
none but girls. The individuals for whose destruction I was respon- 
sible included an equal number of males and females; the same held 
true for La Riccia; but Clairwil, Gravines, and King Ferdinand 
immolated strictly nothing but men, and in the great majority of 
cases, did their killing personally. Throughout the entire exercise we 
were fucked incessantly, and our athletes had to be replaced several 
times over. We retired at the end of forty-five consecutive hours of 
rare riot and divine pleasures. 

“Madame,” I whispered to Charlotte as I faek leave of her, 
“do not forget the little paper you signed for me. x 

“And you,” was Chzrlotte’s reply, “don’t forget our appoint- 


Juliette & 1013 


ment. Be as faithful as I in abiding by our bargain, I ask no more 
of you than that.” 

Once home, I explained to Clairwil in full what I had only been 
able to hint at before. 

“O delightful project!” she said. 

‘And you see, of course, where I want it to lead.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“T loathe Charlotte.” 

‘““My darling! Kiss me... how I share your feelings!” 

“Dear Clairwil, that woman is mad about me, she is forever 
chasing after me with requests to make her discharge. And nothing 
bores me so much as these performances. Only you, my angel, in 
all the world there is no one but you whom I am willing to forgive 
for loving me.’ 

“What a mind you have, Juliette!” 

“It is more than a little like er 

“Oh, indeed it is, my precious. . . . So then, tell me, what do 
you plan to do with this Charlotte? ” 

“The day after I have the contents of the royal exchequer, I 
send this note of hers to the robbed Ferdinand: ‘I shall steal all my 
husband’s treasure, and give it in payment to her who supplies me 
the poison necessary to send him to the next world’—when the dear 
man reads that he will, I should hope, condemn Charlotte to death 
or at least to some frightful prison.” 

‘Yes, but an accused Charlotte will reveal her accomplices; 
she will say that it was to us she turned over his riches.” 

“Will it be presumable that, if we were Charlotte’s corre- 
spondents, we would send the note to the King?” 

‘‘Presumable or not, Ferdinand will have searches conducted.” 

‘‘T shall see to it that they are fruitless. Everything shall be 
buried in our garden. As for the King, I shall go to see him myself. 
If his suspicions fasten too firmly upon us, I shall threaten to make 
public the ghastly joke he played the day before yesterday during 
The Treat. Ferdinand, being weak and stupid, will be frightened, 
and that will be an end to the matter. And then, too, 


’Tis an inglorious triumph earned from a victory 
achieved without peril. 


1014 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Gaining wealth means taking risks: is it your opinion that fifty or 
sixty million are not worth going to some trouble to acquire?” 

“Tf caught, it will mean death for us.” 

“What is that to me? There is nothing I fear less in this 
world than the noose. Is it not common knowledge that death upon 
the gallows is accompanied by a discharge? And discharging is 
something that will never hold terrors for me. If ever a judge 
sends me to the scaffold, you will see me go forward with light and 
impudent step. . .. But calm yourself, Clairwil, crime is our friend, 
we are its favorites. In such enterprises as this we cannot fail.” 

‘Are you thinking of including Borghese in our scheme?” 

“No, I don’t like that woman anymore.” 

“Fuck! for my part I detest her.” 

“She should be got rid of as soon as possible.” 

“There is the trip we are to make to Vesuvius tomorrow... . 

“Indeed there is; that volcano’s deeps must serve as her grave. 
What a way to die!” 

“T imagine it as horrible. Otherwise it would not have occurred 
tome.” 

“T should like something still more cruel.” 

“When the two of us hate, Juliette, oh, we do our hating 
well!” 

‘‘We must dine with her as usual.” 

“And even fawn upon her.” 

“Let me manage that, you know that my features and my 
character are well suited to treachery.” 

“We must frig her tonight.” 

“Of course.” 

“Oh, my angel, we are going to be very rich!” 

“This stroke once accomplished, there will be no further tarry- 
ing in Naples.” 

“Nor in Italy. We must get us back to France, buy properties, 
and spend our remaining days together . . . what delights await us! 
Nothing will restrict them but the laws of our desires.” 

“The instantaneous satisfaction of them all—oh, dear heart, 
what happiness money brings! What a fool is he who abstains from 
employing every means, legitimate and otherwise, for procuring it. 
Clairwil, they will sooner put me a thousand times to death than

deprive me of my taste for theft; it is among my greatest pleasures; 
tis one of the fundamental needs of my existence. When I steal I 
experience the sensation an ordinary woman feels when she is 
frigged. In my case, all crimes chafe the nerve endings in the zones 
of pleasure, just as do fingers or pricks; I discharge merely from 
plotting a felony. Why, here’s an example, this diamond: Charlotte 
offered it to me, it is worth fifty thousand crowns. I declined it. As a 
gift, it displeased me. Stolen, I delight in it.” 

“You took it from her?” 

“I did. It is no wonder to me that some people have sur- 
rendered to this passion solely for the voluptuous effects it pro- 
duces; I would willingly steal for the rest of my life, and I declare 
to you, that had I an income of two million a year, you would still 
see me a thief out of libertinage.” 

‘Ah, my love,” said Clairwil, “how certain it is that Nature 
created us for each other. Never fear, we shall not part.” 

We dined with Borghese, the three of us discussed plans for 
the following day’s excursion to Vesuvius. That evening we were at 
the Opera; the King came to our box to pay us his respects, all eyes 
were turned our way. Home again, we proposed to Borghese that a 
part of the night be given over to eating roasts with Cyprian wine; 
she took gladly to the idea; and we, Clairwil and I, carried deceit- 
fulness to the point of wringing seven or eight discharges from the 
woman our villainy had already doomed, and of discharging almost 
as many times in her embrace. After that we let her go to bed, and 
the two of us spent the remainder of the night together; and before 
it was over, we owed another three or four spasms to the enchanting 
thought that on the morrow we were to make a mockery of every 
sentiment of trust and friendship. Such mischief, I realize, is incon- 
ceivable except to special mentalities like ours; but he is deserving 
of pity who lacks the capacity for it, great pleasures are denied 
him; I venture to affirm that he ignores what true happiness is. 

We rose at an early hour. Criminal projects prevent sleep, 
they sow tumult in the senses; the mind revolves them, explores 
them from all sides, savors all their ramifications, and through 
anticipation you delight unendingly in the pleasure with which you 
know you are going to overflow upon actually committing the 
atrocity. 


1016 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


A coach-and-six conveyed us to the base of Vesuvius. There, we 
found guides who provide the rigs and the ropes whereby visitors 
are helped to climb the volcano: it takes two hours to attain the 
summit. The ascent, before it is over, will have ruined a pair of new 
shoes. We set out in merry spirits; we poked fun at Olympia; and 
the poor creature was far from grasping the double meaning of our 
persiflage, from divining what lay behind our playful teasing. 

It is a dreadful task, struggling up that mountain: ankle-deep 
in ashes the whole time, if you advance four paces, you slip back 
six; and there is the perpetual fear lest you break through some 
thin crust and drop into molten lava. We arrived exhausted and sat 
down to rest once we were at the lip of the crater. "T'was from 
there we gazed with prodigious interest into the throat of this 
volcano which, in its moments of wrath, makes all the Kingdom of 
Naples tremble. 

“Do you think there is anything. to fear today?” we asked 
our guides. 

“No,” they replied, “some brimstone, some sulphur, a few 
bits of pumice may perhaps come up, but it’s not likely that there 
will be an eruption.” 

“Well then, my friends,” said Clairwil, “give us the basket 
containing our refreshments and have the kindness to go back to 
the village. We are going to spend the day here, our intention is to 
do some sketching.” 

“But if something were to happen?” 

“Did you not say that nothing will happen?” 

‘““We cannot be altogether sure.” 

‘Why, when something happens, we will make our way down 
to the village where we hired you, we can see it from here.” 

And with the distribution of three or four gold coins the con- 
versation was brought quickly to an end. 

As soon as they were some four hundred yards away, Clairwil 
and I| exchanged glances. ‘Shall it be ruse?’ I murmured to my 
friend. 

“No, force,” she answered. 

We leapt upon Olympia the next instant. 

“Slut,” she was told, ‘“‘we are tired of you; we led you to this 


Juliette & 1017 


place with a view to your destruction. There is a volcano below: 
you are going to be thrown into it alive.” 

“Oh, my friends!” she gasped. “What have I done?” 

“Nothing at all. We are tired of you. Is that not quite 
enough ?” 

So saying, we stuffed a pocket-handkerchief into her mouth, 
to avoid her screams and jeremiads. Clairwil then tied her hands 
with scarves we had brought for this purpose; I tied her feet; and 
when we had reduced her to helplessness, we contemplated her and 
laughed. Tears flowed from her beautiful eyes, splashed down in 
pearly drops upon her beautiful bosom. We undressed her, we laid 
hands on her, stroked and molested every part of her body; we 
mistreated her snowy breasts, we spanked her charming ass, we 
pricked her buttocks with hatpins, we plucked hairs from her bush; 
and I bit her clitoris almost in two. 

At length, after two hours of unremitting vexations, we 
picked her up by her bound hands and feet, carried her to the 
brink, and let her fall. Down she went into the volcano, and for 
several minutes we listened to the sounds of her body crashing from 
ledge to ledge, being torn by the sharp outcropping rocks: gradu- 
ally the sounds subsided, and then we heard nothing more.. 

“That is that,” said Clairwil, who had been frigging herself 
with both hands ever since letting go of Olympia’s body. “Ah, fuck, 
my love, let’s both lie down on the edge of this volcano and dis- 
charge now; we have just committed a crime, one of those heavenly 
deeds which mortals deem atrocious. Well, I say, if what we have 
done is a true outrage to Nature, then let her avenge herself, for 
she can if she wishes; let an eruption occur, let lava boil up from 
that inferno down there, let a cataclysm snuff out our lives this 
very instant. . . a 

I was in no state to speak. My head reeling already, my only 
reply was to my friend’s pollutions, which I paid back tenfold. She 
too fell silent. Hugged tight in each other’s arms, writhing with 
joy, frigging each other like frenzied tribades, we seemed bent on 
exchanging souls through the medium of our panted sighs. A few 
lewd words, a few blasphemies, no other utterances came from us. 
Through our deed we were insulting Nature, defying her, baiting 


1018 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


her; and triumphant in the impunity in which her unconcern left us, 
we looked to be profiting from her indulgence only in order to 
irritate her the more grievously. 

‘‘And so,” said Clai-wil, the first to be restored to reason, ‘“‘you 
see, Juliette, how little Nature is disturbed by mankind’s alleged 
crimes; she does not want the power to swallow us up, she could 
destroy us even if it were in the depths of delight. Has she done 
so? Ah, be easy, there is no crime on earth capable of drawing 
Nature’s wrath down upon us; rather, all crimes are to her ad- 
vantage, all are useful to her, and whenever she inspires it in us, be 
certain that it is because she has need of crime.” 

Clairwil had no sooner finished than a shower of stones shot 
up out of the volcano and rained down around us. 

“Ah ha!” said I, not even deigning to get to my feet, ‘“Olym- 
pia’s revenge! These bits of sulphur, these pebbles are her farewell 
to us, she notifies us that she is already in the entrails of the earth.” 

‘Nothing more readily explained than this phenomenon,” 
Clairwil remarked. ‘‘Whenever a weighty body falls into the vol- 
cano, by agitating the matter eternally boiling in its depths, it 
provokes a slight eruption.” 

“Come, let us have our lunch, and be assured when I tell you 
that the rain of stones which we have just witnessed is nothing else, 
my dear, than Olympia’s request for her clothes; we must not refuse 
it.” 

And after having sorted out the gold and precious stones, we 
made the rest into a bundle and threw the telltale evidence into the 
same crater which had just received our friend. Then we opened 
our lunch-basket. No further sound came from below; the crime 
had been consummated, Nature was content. We made our descent 
and found our guides again at the foot of the mountain. 

“A perfectly frightful misfortune has befallen us,” we said, 
going up to them with tears in our eyes, “our unlucky companion 
ventured too near to the edge and... alas! she tumbled over it. 
Oh, good people, is there: anything to be done?” 

“Nothing,” they all said; “you ought to have let us remain 
with you, this would not have happened. She is lost. You will never 
see her again.” 

Upon hearing that cruel announcement our feigned tears 


Juliette ee 1019 


flowed the faster and, wringing our hands, we stepped into our 
coach. Three-quarters of an hour later we were in Naples. 

We published our misfortune the very same day; Ferdinand 
came in person to console us, believing we were truly sisters and 
devoted to one another. Depraved though he was, the thought 
never entered his mind that foul play might have overtaken Olym- 
pia; we did not disturb his illusions. We sent the Princess’ retinue 
back to Rome with certificates of her accident, and we sent to in- 
quire of her family what disposition it wished to have made of her 
jewelry, valued, we wrote, at thirty thousand francs, although in 
fact she left behind better than one hundred thousand francs worth 
of spoils, seven-tenths of which we had appropriated, you under- 
stand; but we had left Naples by the time the family’s answer 
artived there, and were able to assume undisputed possession of the 
entirety of our friend’s property. 

Olympia, Princess Borghese, was a gentle, trusting, affection- 
ate woman, willful in her pleasures, libertine by temperament, with 
imagination, but who lacked depth and rigor in her principles; 
timorous, still in prejudice’s grip, apt at any moment to give way 
before a reverse, and who, owing to nothing more than this one 
weakness, was unsuitable company for a pair of women as corrupt 
as ourselves. 

A more important affair lay before us. The next day was the 
one I had chosen with Charlotte for the attack upon her husband’s 
treasure. Clairwil and I therefore spent the rest of the evening 
preparing a dozen big chests and trunks, and having a large hole 
dug in our garden: this was done in utmost secrecy and the work- 
man, whose brains we scrupulously blew out once he had completed 
his task, was the first object buried in that pit: “Either have no 
accomplices,” Machiavelli advises, “or get rid of thém as soon as 
they have served their purpose.” 

Then came the moment to appear with the wagon beneath the 
specified windows. Clairwil and I, disguised as men, drove the 
vehicle ourselves; for we had dismissed our servants for the night, 
and sent them out to a party in the countryside. Charlotte was at 
her post and waiting: in her eagerness for the promised poison, her 
reward if all went well, she did not wish to be guilty of the slightest 
negligence. For four hours she lowered out bags which, as fast as 


1020 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


they came down, we stowed into our chests; and finally we heard 
her say that there was nothing more left. 

“Until tomorrow,” we replied. 

And we drove quickly to our mansion, lucky enough not to 
have met with a living soul during the whole time the operation 
lasted. A second man 1elped us unload and bury the trunks and 
chests, and he was buried on top of them when his usefulness was 
at an end. 

Weary, fretful, anxious now that we were so rich, we went to 
bed this one time without thinking of pleasures. We woke the next 
morning to find all the town talking about the robbery that had 
been committed at the Royal Palace; this seemed the propitious 
moment to have the Queen’s note delivered to Ferdinand, and it 
was brought to him by an anonymous hand. No sooner had ke read 
it than, flying into a mighty rage, he himself placed his wife under 
arrest, turned her over to the captain of his guard with orders to 
take her to Sant’ Elmo, where she was given the coarsest raiment 
to wear, the simplest fare to eat, and placed in solitary confinement. 
A week passes without his going to see her. She beseeches him to 
come. At last he appears. The villainous creature blurts out every- 
thing and compromises us in the most thorough manner. Ferdinand 
rushes to our address, furious; and as the conversation we had with 
him is interesting, I shall give it in dialogue form. 

FERDINAND: You are guilty of a horrible deed; how could I 
have expected such a thing from persons whom I took to be my 
friends! 

CLAIRWIL: What is the matter ? 

FERDINAND: The Queen accuses you of having stolen my 
treasure. 

JULIETTE: Us? 

FERDINAND: You. 

CLAIRWIL: Likely story ! 

FERDINAND: She admits to having ‘momentarily entertained 
the thought of taking my life, and she affirms that you promised 
to supply her the poison necessary to that end, my treasure being 
the payment you demanded of her in return. 

CLAIRWIL: You have found the poison she claims she bought 
for that exceedingly high price? 


Juliette & 1021 


FERDINAND: No. 

JULIETTE: How is it possible in that case that she consent to 
turn over her fortune before obtaining the promised poison? 

FERDINAND: I have wondered about that myself. 

CLAIRWIL: Sire, your wife is a rascal, but a very clumsy one; 
knowing that we were your intimates, she has thought to disguise 
her infamy by shifting the responsibility for her execrable scheme 
upon our shoulders, but it’s a flimsy and ill-contrived plot. 

FERDINAND: Who could have sent me that note ? 

JULIETTE: Those who have your treasure, no doubt: but, be 
certain of it, they are already far away. That note’s senders would 
not have informed you had it meant jeopardizing their own safety, 
and it is to put you off the scent that the Queen names us. 

FERDINAND: But how is it to Charlotte’s interest to protect 
those who have just betrayed her? 

CLAIRWIL: She has the poison, she does not want you to know 
she has it; hence, she brings suspicion to bear upon two people who 
cannot affirm that they gave it to her. Nevertheless, she has it, and 
but for the steps you have taken, you were a doomed man. 

FERDINAND: In your opinion, then, I have done the right 
thing ? 

JULIETTE: It would have been difficult to do any better. 

FERDINAND: Do you think she is the culprit? (Here Clairwil 
puts on a malicious smile.) Ah, I see it from your expression! 
Turn the knife in the wound: is there something else you know? 

CLAIRWIL: Only that your wife is a monster; she has acted out 
of hatred for you, and you would be very wise to see to it that she 
is punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

FERDINAND: Oh, speak out, my friends, have you really no 
knowledge of who has stolen my treasure ? 

JULIETTE and CLAIRWIL: None, we. swear it. 

FERDINAND: Then let her perish in her dungeon, let her die 
of hunger and despair there . . . and you, dear friends, forgive me 
for having formed suspicions in your regard. They were unjust ; I 
ask you to pardon me. 

JULIETTE: Sire, those suspicions did however exist, and with 
your leave we must therefore take our immediate departure out of 
your realm. 


1022 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


FERDINAND: Departure? No, I implore you, now that I am 
free of the encumbrance of that vicious wife . . . I feel infinitely 
more at ease, and there are marvelous things for us all to do 
together— 

JULIETTE: Your peace of mind, my Lord, does not establish. 
ours. Comfort is irrevocably gone for decent women upon whose 
honor the merest aspersion has been once cast. 

FERDINAND: Ah, but I no longer suspect either one of you. 
(He falls upon his knezs.) Never abandon me; I shall not be able 
to get on without you, I shall never console myself if I lose you too. 

CLAIRWIL: And what was the sum the thieves took from you? 

FERDINAND: Fortv million, half of all I owned. The criminal 
admits that she promised the whole of my fortune, but she did not 
dare strip me of everything. 

“The infamous creature,” said I, but animated by feelings in 
which the King could nct have followed me, those of rage at having 
been cheated by Charlotte, “the monster! what audacity! and what 
impudence! Thus to deceive the very best of husbands! A man who 
was so fond of her, who toiled selflessly in behalf of her pleasures! 
Oh, blackest ingratitude! For which the most fiendish punishment 
would be far too mild.’' 

At that point Elise and Raimonde, decked out like goddesses, 
made their entrance, bearing chocolate for His Majesty. Until now 
Ferdinand had not clapped eyes on the two girls. 

“What beauties are these ?” he asked, all atremble. 

“Our handmaidens,” I answered. 

‘Why have they not been presented to me hitherto ?” 

‘Could we have supposed they might please you?” 

And with singular promptness forgetting both his prisoner and 
his robbery, the rake wants those two creatures surrendered to him 
on the spot. Such desires, in view of the circumstances, required 
speedy satisfaction. A boudoir opens before Ferdinand, into it he 
goes with our women and does not emerge until two hour later, 
after having worked the pair to exhaustion. 

‘‘Most generous friends,” says he upon reappearing in our 
midst, “I beg you not to desert my city and me. Only let all re- 
proaches be forgotten, and I protest to you that henceforth I shall 
behold you as paragons of innocence and probity.” 


Juliette %& 1023 


And he left our house. 

Had the sovereign of Naples not been such a weak-spirited 
caitiff, Queen Charlotte would have been poisoned inside a day; we 
had given Ferdinand plentiful motives for the deed; but’ that un- 
forceful and characterless man, was he capable of a vigorous ac- 
tion? No; and he took none at all. News of the Queen’s detention 
and of its brevity was to reach the whole of Europe, but the reasons 
for both her imprisonment and her release were to remain un- 
explained. As for ourselves, not caring to wait to learn the outcome 
of this adventure, we turned at once to organizing our-retreat. Our 
loot proved voluminous and heavy. As we had bought a quantity of 
busts, mosaics, antique marbles, and samples of stone from Vesu- 
vius, we cached our gold in false bottoms built into the packing 
cases ordered for shipping our purchases, and this stratagem’ suc- 
ceeded to perfection. Before closing up ‘the cases we sent a request 
to the King, asking him to inspect our baggage; he declined; we 
nailed everything shut. Ten wagons bore it all away, and we 
followed after in two coaches, one for our suite, one for ourselves. 
Just before leaving we went to say goodbye to Ferdinand, who 
again did all he possibly could to change our minds, and who then, 
having had to accept the inevitable, himself handed us the passports 
necessary to cross the borders of his states. 


That evening we lay over at Capua; a week later, at Rome, 
where we arrived without having encountered the least difficulty on 
the road. Not until then did Clairwil notify her brother of her 
design to accompany me on to Paris, where it was her intention to 
settle for the rest of her life. She besought him to come to Paris 
too; but Brisatesta could not take it upon himself to quit his pro- 
fession, and despite the wealth he had already amassed from out- 
lawry, he solemnly declared that his unalterable decision was to die 
pistol in hand. 

“So be it,” said Clairwil. “My preference goes to you, 
Juliette. We shall never separate again, that is my wish.” 

I hugged my friend in my arms and swore to her she would 
never have cause to repent her decision. Ah! Making that promise, 


1024 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


how little was I aware of the destiny that had already been spelled 
out by our stars, Clairwil’s and mine. 

We continued our journey, which was uneventful until we 
reached Ancona. There, taking advantage of the fairest weather, 
we were strolling along the port when we perceived a tall woman 
of some forty-five years gazing at us fixedly. 

“Do you recognize that person?” Clairwil asked me. 

I turn, I scrutinize her. “Bless me, Clairwil! She is no other 
than our Parisian sorceress. It’s Durand.” 

Her name was yet on my lips when its owner came up and 
greeted us rapturously. 

“Ah,” said Clairwil, somewhat startled to see again the 
woman who five years before had predicted she had only that 
interval to live, “by what stroke of chance do we meet in this city?” 

“Come with me to my lodgings,” said Durand, still beautiful 
with the passing of time; ‘‘although these people do not understand 
our tongue, we have rothing to gain from conversing in their 
presence.” 

We accompany her; and after having ushered us into the 
luxurious quarters she occupied at the inn, ‘How pleased I am,” 
she told us as soon as we were seated, ‘‘to be able to procure you 
the acquaintance of a most outstanding woman, one of the most 
unusual and the most like yourselves Nature has yet created.” 

“To whom do you refer ?” Clairwil asked. 

“To a sister of the Empress, an aunt of Naples’ Queen, a 
figure completely unknown to the world. As a very young child, 
Princess Christine eviclenced propensities to libertinage of such 
violence that her father sensed she would become absolutely un- 
manageable. Seeing her bad habits grow steadily worse with age, 
he thought best to buy an island for her in Dalmatia, at the head of 
the Adriatic; he assigned her an income of three million a year, and 
put her under the protection of the Venetians, who by treaty 
recognized her sovereignty over the island and her right to do 
there whatever she liked. Christine, relegated to her little kingdom 
sixteen years ago, is at present forty years of age, and leads a life 
of delicious indulgence in everything the extremest lubricity can 
inspire. But it will spoil the adventure if I tell you more about her; 


Juliette 2 1025 


we shall cross the gulf in one of her barks, it is at my permanent 
disposition. The voyage lasts a day and a night; have you decided ?” 

‘We certainly have,” I answered, ‘‘since I am confident I can 
speak for Clairwil too: the object of our travels being to study the 
manners and morals of mankind and to see extraordinary things, 
we would not be living up to our purpose if we were to forego such 
an opportunity out of halfheartedness.” 

‘‘By God, yes,” said my friend, “we shall do some fine fucking 
on Christine’s isle.” 

“Never,” said Durand, “never shall you have such pleasure.” 

‘“‘And upon that island of hers,” I said, “does she have—” 

“No,” Durand interrupted me, “not another word. I want 
everything to be a surprise for you.” 

And as she seemed unwilling to pursue the subject farther, I 
introduced another. ‘‘Now that I have found you again,” I said to 
the sorceress, “you must account for your sudden disappearance 
from Paris. Why were you not at the rendezvous arranged by that 
Comte de Belmor with whom I put you into touch?” 

“Indeed,” Durand replied, “I failed to come to that appoint- 
ment, and it was for the very best of reasons: that was the day they 
hanged me.” 

“What!” 

“Hanged me, I say. It was simple enough: I had furnished 
poison to the young Duc ***, he needed some to put his mother 
out of the way. Compunction upset the little fool’s scheme; he 
betrayed me; I was arrested, brought to trial within the space of a 
day. But, wonderfully connected with the Samson who presided, we 
found a compromise whereby I would be hanged merely for form’s 
sake. I held them off by eleventh-hour recriminations, and it was not 
until after night had fallen I was finally led down from the Hotel 
de Ville. Samson himself tied the noose, directed the mummery. I 
was carted to the graveyard, one of his valets, acting upon instruc- 
tions, bought my body, and I was able to leave Paris before dawn. 
I went back the following year, to another quarter of town and 
under a different name; there has been no further fuss from any- 
body, and business has been steady and good ever since. There is 
truth in the saying that the hangman's rope brings good luck. My 


1026 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


income is today sixty thousand pounds, and I have been adding to 
my capital every year. I make an annual journey to Italy, where I 
replenish my stock of materials and compound the poisons I then 
distribute throughout all Etrope. I find that preferable to preparing 
them at home. Actually, this kind of murdering is nowadays so 
much in style that it is all I can do to keep up with the demand. At 
Christine’s you will have occasion to see the very piquant effects of 
the venoms I have devel sped.” 

“You sell some to her ?” 

‘My God, a hundred thousand crowns’ worth every year.” 

“She is cruel, I take it?” 

“Incredibly so.” 

“Ah, I adore her already!” Clairwil exclaimed. ‘““Whenever 
you wish, Durand, let us sail for Dalmatia.” 

“Charming woman,” I put in, “‘before anything else you must 
answer some more questions. I insist that you tell me who those 
curious individuals were, by whom you had us beaten, flogged; and 
who, in short, performed so many uncommon things before us 
when we were with you last.” 

“One of them,” said Durand, ‘twas that same Duc ***, 
Beaujeon was the other, the famous millionaire. For four years 
both had been feeing me enormously for services of a similar kind, 
and there is no counting the number of women and girls I deceived 
for them in the very same way. But, while I think of it,” said 
Durand, ringing for a servant, “you must not suppose that I am 
going to allow you to leave without having dinner. I would be 
heartbroken not to have you as my guests; I shall hear no 
refusals....” 

And the most splendid meal was brought in almost immedi- 
ately. 

“Durand,” said Clairwil when we reached dessert, ‘you 
promise us great pleasures for tomorrow. But what of today’s? It 
seems to me that among your valets I detected three or four 
strapping fellows with a very stiff-pricked look about them.” 

“Do you care to test their mettle?” 

“Why not! And you, Juliette, what say you?” 

“No,” I demurred. preoccupied with a thought I could not 
drive out of my head, an ill-defined premonition, “no, I believe I 


Juliette 1027 


will drink a glass and talk with Durand rather than fuck. Besides, I 
am menstruating, and feel a little out of sorts.” 

“Until now I have never known you to refuse a prick,” said 
Clairwil, and for the briefest instant there showed upon her face 
a shadow of concern whose cause I was far from apprehending. 
“Come, my angel,” she resumed, brightening again, ‘when one 
cannot fuck in front, one fucks behind. Come, I say, join me: well 
you know that [| taste no real pleasures save they be shared with 
you.” 

“No,” I repeated, still in the grip of that unknown foreboding, 
“T don’t feel at all in a mood for it... I simply wish to chat.” 

Clairwil walked toward the chamber that had been designated 
to her and, just before she entered it, I distinctly saw, in a mirror, 
the emphatic sign she made to the sorceress, a sign which I could 
interpret as nothing else than an injunction to silence. The door to 
the chamber closed; I remained sitting with Durand. 

‘Oh, Juliette,” that woman said to me as soon as we had been 
left alone, “thank your lucky stars for all the sentiments you in- 
spire in me. Charming girl,” she continued, taking me in her arms, 
“no, you shall not be the victim of that monster. . . . In every 
respect preferable to her, you shall be warned in time and your 
life saved,” 

‘“‘What are you saying to me, Madame! Such words freeze me 
with terror !”’ 

‘Listen to me, Juliette; and having heard me, reveal nothing. 
This island in Dalmatia . . . this Princess Christine, this voyage... 
dear girl, had you taken it you were doomed. ’Twas all a trap set 
by a woman whom you believed to be your dearest friend.” 

“Clairwil!”’ 

“She plotted your death. She covets your wealth; in her pocket 
she has a piece of paper, a document in which you each name the 
other her sole heir. She was to assassinate you to come into posses- 
sion of that legacy—” 

“The infernal creature!” I gasped, breathless with fury. 

‘Steady, Juliette; a careless word could still be your undoing; 
sit where you are and hear me out. The vessel we were to embark 
upon, it sinks, we escape the wreck, you perish in it... . Take your 
revenge; take this packet I have here . . . it contains fulminant 


1028 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


powder; among our poisons none acts more rapidly. Let her absorb 
a little and the next instant she will lie at your feet, as if thunder- 
struck. In return for this service I am rendering you I demand 
nothing; consider it as flowing from an excessive fondness for you.”’ 

“O my benefactress!”” I cried, tears springing to my eyes, 
‘you save me from the very direst danger! But much mystery yet 
clings to all this. How is it that you are in Ancona? How did 
Clairwil enter into contact with you?” 

“I have been following a step behind you ever since you left 
Naples, where I myself had gone to buy poisons. Clairwil met me 
there, laid out her scheme before me; at Loreto I hastened on 
ahead, and reached Ancona before you did, to set the stage for a 
scene to which I lent myself only because of the deepest desire to 
save your life. Had I refused Clairwil my collaboration, she would 
without question have had recourse to other means, and you would 
not be alive today.” 

“But once Clairwil decided to get rid of me, what need had 
she to wait so long?” 

“That document had not yet been drawn up, your money was 
not yet invested, nothing could be done until you were out of Rome; 
and she knew that, once you had left that city, your first stop 
would not come until Loreto. "Twas for the day after she ordered 
me to have everything in readiness.” 

“Infamous creature! Thou whom I loved so sincerely, in 
whose arms I surrendered myself in such candid good faith!” 

“She is a monster of perfidy and deceit,” Durand rejoined; 
“trust her under no circumstances. Just when you think you have 
the least to fear from her, that is the very instant when you must 
be most on your guard. Hark. I hear sounds. She may be about to 
return; the fact we are having this conversation together is not to 
her liking. Compose yourself, and when you strike, do not miss the 
mark; godspeed.” 

Clairwil was indeed upset when she returned; she had had an 
unsatisfactory fucking, said she,.the two men given her had held 
their erections poorly. And over and above the rest, she was not 
accustomed to tasting pleasures in which her dear Juliette did not 
take an active part. 


Juliette & 1029 


“T would discharge better with you, 
disposed to a little masturbating.” 

“Tonight,” I replied, disguising my cruel state as best I could, 
“yes, tonight. At the moment, my dear, Adonis himself would 
leave me cold.” 

‘Very well,” said she, “let us go to our inn. I too feel out of 
sorts, I don’t think I’d mind being in bed early. Goodbye, Durand,” 
she added, “and until tomorrow. Endeavor to have musicians, good 
food, and, above all, some good fuckers aboard that boat; without 
them I find travel by sea unendurably boring.” 

We repaired to our lodgings. 

“A strange woman, that Durand,” Clairwil said to me once 
we were alone together; “‘she is someone to be very wary of, my 
dearest. Were I not so devoted to you. . . . Would you believe, 
Juliette, that while you were off in the privy for a few minutes, 
the villain offered to poison you for two thousand Jouis ?” 

This sally did not catch me off balance; in it I saw nothing but 
a wicked snare, which I had no trouble eluding. However, I deemed 
best to feign credulity. 

“Great God,” I said, ‘that woman is a monster! I now under- 
stand why I felt so distrustful of her the whole while we were 
talking.” 

“Your instincts warned you, and rightly: she had worked out 
a scheme for killing you, Juliette. The thought of your death enter- 
tained her.”’ 

“Ah,” said I, looking hard at Clairwil, “the stroke was per- 
haps to have been brought off during the voyage to the island. . . .” 

“No,” said Clairwil, without the flutter of an eyelash, “it was 
to have been this evening, at supper, and that is the reason [| 
dragged you home so early.” 

“But this voyage,” I said, “it worries me now; are you sure 
there is no danger ?” 

“None in the least: I completely changed her mind, and I 
guarantee you that she has forgotten the idea. Let us have supper.” 

The meal was served us; I had taken my decision. To be the 
dupe of Clairwil’s tales, this was absolutely impossible; and 
Durand’s avowals, their frankness, their warmth had so impressed 
me... . Into the first dish I hancled Clairwil I slipped the poison 


she went on, ‘‘were you

hidden between my fingers; she took a mouthful, swallowed, 
swayed in her chair, and fell, emitting a single furious scream. 

‘Behold my revenge,” I said to my women, both bewildered 
by Clairwil’s sudden collapse. 

And I related the adventure to them. 

‘Fuck!’ I cried, “‘let us savor the sweet charms of vengeance, 
my dears, and acquit ourselves of a few horrors; the two of you, 
frig me as I lie upon that whore’s dead body, and may her example 
teach you never to betray your best friend.” 

We stripped off Clairwil’s clothes, we stretched her naked 
corpse upon a bed. ... I put my hand to her cunt, it was still warm, 
I frigged her; donning a dildo, I fucked her. Elise gave me her ass 
to kiss; and in the meantime I tickled Raimonde’s cunt. I spoke to 
Clairwil as though she were ever alive, I addressed reproaches to 
her, invectives, as though she were able to hear me; I took up some 
withes, I lashed her unmoving body . . . I embuggered it. It never 
stirred, it was utterly without feeling; and at last I saw that there 
was no hope left, and I had that body put into a sack. And Clairwil’s 
own valets, who had hated her and who were as grateful to me as 
could be for having delivered them from such a wicked mistress, 
they agreed, once night tad come, to go secretly with her body and 
drop it into the sea. 

I wrote forthwith to my banker in Rome to advise him that 
by virtue of the contract we had entered into, Clairwil and I, 
through which the moneys we had invested with him belonged to 
the one of us who might chance to survive the other, he could 
henceforth remit all revenues to me; whence it resulted that by 
merging the two fortunes, I secured myself an annual income of 
two million. In Italy, nothing is more quickly straightened out 
than a murder: I had two hundred sequins transmitted to the 
justice of Ancona, and there was not so much as an inquest. 

‘And so, my fine friend,” I said to Durand when, the next 
day, I went to dine with her, “you thought to outwit me, did you? 
Clairwil let the cat out of the bag: how you meant to poison me last 
night, and would have had she not stood in the way.” 

‘‘Treacherous to the last,” said Durand gravely, shaking her 
head. “Oh, Juliette, I told you the truth, believe it: I love you far 
too much to deceive you upon such serious matters. There is much 


Juliette sb 1031 


of the scoundrel in me, perhaps more than in most others, but when 
I love a woman, I never play her false. . . . The blow, then, has not 
been struck ?” 

“No; Clairwil breathes, she and I are about to resume our 
journey. I came to bid you farewell. And now I shall go—” 

“Oh, Juliette! I am poorly rewarded for all I have done—” 

‘Better than you think, Durand,” I interrupted, with one 
hand tendering her a pocketbook containing one hundred thousand 
crowns, with the other exhibiting to her the tresses I had shorn 
from Clairwil. ‘“Hert are the ornaments of the head you proscribed, 
and here is the recompense for your generous friendship.” 

‘Keep these things, keep them all,” Durand replied. “Juliette, 
I adore you. For what I have done I wish no reward other than the 
happiness of being able to give you my unrivaled affection: I was 
jealous of Clairwil, I do not hide it, but I might nevertheless have 
spared her had it not been for her terrible designs in your regard: I 
could not forgive her for having meditated the destruction of some- 
one whose life meant more to me even than my own. I am far less 
wealthy than you, admittedly, but I have the means to live in 
magnificence, and can afford to decline the gift you offer me: with 
such professional skills as I possesss I shall never lack for money, 
and I do not want to be paid for a service performed at my heart’s 
demand.” 

‘‘No further separation between us ever again,” said I to 
Durand, “leave your inn, come join me in mine; you will take 
Clairwil’s domestics, her carriage, and we shall set off for Paris 
in two or three days.” 

The new arrangements were quickly conipleted; Durand re- 
tained but one of her chambermaids, to whom she was especially 
attached, dismissed all the rest of her household, and came to 
install herself in what had formerly been Clairwil’s quarters. 

It was easy to see, from the way that woman devoured me 
with her eyes, that she was on tenterhooks for the moment when 
my favors would reward her for her efforts in my behalf. I did not 
allow her to pine away for long; after the most sumptuous and 
elegant repast, I stretch forth my arms to her, she leaps into them, 
we dash to my bedchamber, lock the door, draw the shutters, and 
I surrender, with inexpressible delight, to the most libertine and 


1032 -~ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


the most lustful of women. Durand, in her fiftieth year, was not 
by any means devoid of merit; her forms were full, shapely, and 
well preserved; her mouth fresh, her skin soft and showing scarcely 
a wrinkle; a superb posterior, breasts still firm and very fair, 
very lively eyes, very fine features; and an energy in her pleasure- 
taking, tastes so bizarre. . . . Capricious Nature had created her 
with a deformity neither Clairwil nor I had ever noticed: Durand 
was unable, had never been able, to enjoy pleasure in the con- 
ventional manner. Her vagina was obstructed, but (and you will 
doubtless recall this detail) her clitoris, as long as a finger, gave 
her the most ardent liking for women. She would flog them, she 
would embugger them; she held commerce with boys also: I shortly 
discovered, from the inordinate size of her asshole, that, as 
regarded intromissions, she was wont to receive there what she 
was denied elsewhere. The initial advances were made by me, and I 
thought she was going to swoon from pleasure the moment she 
felt my hands upon her flesh. 

“Let’s undress,”’ said she, “‘one cannot enjoy oneself properly 
save when naked. I have, moreover, the keenest desire to look 
again upon your charms, Juliette, I burn to feast upon them.” 

Everything is removed in a trice. My kisses explore that 
beautiful body; and I am bound to say that perhaps, had Durand 
been younger, yes, I might not have found her anything like so 
interesting. My tastes were beginning to turn to depravation, and 
entering into my riper years, Nature was providing me with sensa- 
tions far more intense than anything I had known in my springtime. 
The unique object of that woman’s fiery caresses, great tides of 
lust boiled up in me; my partner deployed a science and an art 
that are positively not tc be described. Oh, how voluptuous are 
women seasoned in crime! what dimensions are revealed in their 
lubricities ! 

You listless and uninspired prudes, insufferable creatures who 
dare not even touch the member perforating you, and who would 
blush to answer fuck with fuck when fucking, cast your eyes this 
way, come hither for some examples: come take a few lessons from 
Madame Durand, and learn the extent of your ineptitudes. 

After the initial caresses, Durand, less inhibited than when 


Juliette 1033 


in the past Clairwil had been a party to our affairs, made declaration 
of her fancies and besought me to submit to them. As she knelt 
before me, I had, while heaping abuse upon her, to rub her nose 
now in my cunt, now in my ass; while rubbing my front against her, 
I had to piss upon her face. That done, I-had to strike her all about 
the body with my fists and kick her everywhere, take up some 
nettles and flog her till she bled. When by dint of mistreatments 
I had beaten her down to the floor, I had, with my head between 
her thighs, to cunt-suck her for fifteen minutes while socratizing 
her with one hand and exciting her nipples with the other; next, 
once she was thoroughly heated, I was to let her embugger me with 
her clitoris the while she tickled mine. 

“I apologize for having to ask so much, Juliette,” the liber- 
tine said, once she had: finished outlining the program, “but you 
know to what satiety can lead us.” 

‘After thirty-five years of sustained libertinage one mist offer 
no excuses for one’s tastes,” was my reply; ‘‘whatever it may be, 
it is deserving of respect, for it is in Nature; the best of all is the 
one that pleases us most.” 

And starting in upon the operation, so amply did I satisfy 
her that she was nigh to perishing from delight. Durand’s volup- 
tous crises were without parallel. In all my life I had never seen 
a woman discharge thus: not only would she shoot her fuck forth 
like a man, but she accompanied that ejaculation by shrieks so loud, 
by blasphemies so energetic, and by spasms so violent that one 
could have mistaken her performance for an epileptic attack. I was 
buggered as solidly as if I had been dealing with a man, and from 
it experienced the same pleasure. 

““Well,”’ said she when she rose to her feet, “how do I strike 

ou?” 

“Oh, fuck!” I cried, “you are delightful, you are a very model 
of lubricity; your passions set me ablaze, do to me everything I 
have just done to you.” 

“What! You wish a beating?” 

“Beat me, yes.” 

“And a slapping, a whipping ?” 

‘Make haste.” 


1034 <b» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Do you want me to piss upon your face ?” 

“Of course, my darling, be quick, I say, for I’m very hot and 
I have a discharge pressing.” 

La Durand, with a longer experience than I in the rendering 
of these services, proceeds with such consummate skill that. the 
explosion supervenes almost instantaneously, thanks to the heavenly 
titillations of her voluptuous tongue. 

‘How you do discharge, my beloved,” she said to me; “how 
vehemently you respond <o pleasure! How marvelously we get on!” 

“There is no denying it, Durand,” I answered her, “you have 
an astonishing effect upcn my imagination: I am overjoyed to be 
connected with a woman like you. Mistresses of all a universe we 
shall be; through our alliance I feel we shall become the superiors 
of Nature herself. Oh, dear Durand, the crimes we are going to 
commit! the infamies we are going to achieve!” 

“Do you regret Clairwil ?” 

“Can I when I possess you ?” 

‘‘And if I had invented the whole story merely in order to rid 
myself of a rival?” 

‘‘A rare piece of villainy !” 

“And whatif I had accomplished it?” 

“But, Durand, Clairwil told me that you had proposed to 
poison me for two thousand /ouis.” 

“I knew she would repeat that to you; neither did I have the 
slightest doubt but that, instead of being taken in by this confidence, 
you would simply perceive it for a clumsily mounted snare on her 
part, and subtle as I knew you to be, judge that the time had come 
for the crime which I was eager to have you commit.” 

‘‘And why had the thing to be done by me? Could you not 
have executed it by yourself ?” 

“IT much preferred that my rival die by your hand; my pleasure, 
to be complete, required that the act be undertaken by you.” 

‘Good heaven, what a woman you are! But she was ill at 
ease the other day, when we were your guests at dinner, she was 
unable to relish the pleasures you had readied for her; our conver- 
sation, she seemed apprchensive about it . . . she made a sign to 

ou.” 

“I had created the conditions for that uneasiness, calculating 


Juliette %& 1035 


Jt 


what its repercussions would be upon you; and I estimated exactly, 
as you see, for her unquiet manner shortly rendered her guiltier 
in your eyes. Telling her I was willing to poison you for two thou- 
sand Jouis, I bred in her the suspicion that I might make a like 
proposition to you. Therein lies the explanation for her gesture, 
therein the reason why she dreaded our téte-a-téte, and her trem- 
bling, expression of the fear I engendered in her, produced upon 
your mind the precise effect I anticipated: two hours later, Clairwil 
was dead.” 

‘‘Am I then to understand that she was innocent?” 

‘She adored you .. . and so did I, and I could not bear having 
a rival.” 

‘“Gloat over your triumph, scoundrel,” I say, casting myself 
into Durand’s arms, ‘and, now, your triumph is entire: I worship 
you to the point where, had this crime to be committed all over 
again, I would commit it unprompted, without any of the motiva- 
tions you created to facilitate it... . Why did you not declare your 
love for me from the very first in Paris?” 

“I dared not because of Clairwil’s presence; and when later 
you came back to see me, it was with a man, and then it was he 
who hindered me. And after that came my arrest. But I followed 
you, dearest and sweetest friend, never once did I let you out of my 
sight, I followed you to Angers, throughout Italy, all the while 
I carried on my trade I kept my eyes upon you. My hope sank as I 
watched your successive liaisons—Donis, Grillo, Borghese— 
and it dwindled almost to nothing when | learned that you had 
become reunited with Clairwil. Still, I followed you from Rome 
to here, and at last, tired of having been thwarted so long, I re- 
solved to bring about the denouement: and the rest you know.” 

‘Inexplicable and delightful creature! Who has ever pro- 
vided such examples of treachery, sleight, spitefulness, villainy, 
jealousy !” 

‘Tis because no one has ever had either passions or a heart 
like mine. "Tis because no one has ever loved you as I do.” 

‘But when the fires die down in you, Durand, you will deal 
with me as you have just done with Clairwil; will I have time to 
protect myself ?” 

“I am going to set you at ease, my angel, and reply strongly 


1036 «t+ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


to your groundless suspicions; listen to me. You shall, I demand it, 
keep for yourself, and forever, one of your women, Elise or 
Raimonde. Choose which of the two it is to be, I shall not let you 
have the other, I tell you so in advance.” 

‘‘Raimonde shall be mine.”’ 

‘Very well. If eve- Raimonde meets with a tragic and un- 
accountable end, let the blame fall nowhere but upon me. And now,” 
Durand continued, ‘I demand that you put a paper into this girl’s 
keeping, which authorizes her to denounce me as your assassin in 
the event you perish in some unhappy way at any moment during 
the course of our relations.” 

‘‘No, I object to such precautions, I entrust myself to you, 
I do so gladly; I like the idea of placing my life in your hands. 
Leave Elise to me, leave everybody to me, don’t hinder my prac- 
tices or contest my tastes. I am a libertine, I will not promise you 
good behavior, but I shall swear an oath to adore you ever- 
lastingly.”” 

“I have no wish to tyrannize over you, Juliette; to the con- 
trary, I shall myself serve your pleasures, I shall move heaven and 
earth for the sake of your physical enjoyments. But were your 
conduct ever to become ethical, I’d abandon you there and then. 
I am aware of the impossibility of captivating such a woman as 
yourself, a whore by temperament and on principle: ’twould, I 
realize, be to seek to set dikes to the sea. But I can always be the 
mistress of your heart, and that is what I ask... I insist that it 
belong to nobody but me.” 

“T swear that it shall be so.” 

‘Ah, great pleasures are then in store for us; libertinage, to 
remain pure, must be kept free of sentiment: one must have but 
one friend only, sincerely love no one but her, and fuck with the 
whole wide world. Juliette, my best advice, if you care to hear it, 
is to dispense with this glittering entourage you move with; I 
myself plan to dismiss half my suite; we shall manage just as 
comfortably when we are fewer, and it serves no purpose to attract 
universal notice. Moreover, I wish to pursue my calling, and no 
one is apt to buy anything from a woman who goes traveling about 
like a queen.” 

“And I too,” I replied, “I wish to satisfy my tastes, I wish 


Juliette %& 1037 


to steal, I wish to prostitute myself, and, you are quite right, such 
exhibition will interfere with my objectives.” 

“It ought, I believe, to be given out that I am your mother, 
with this title I shall be able to prostitute you myself; Elise and 
Raimonde, let them be your cousins. We shall market their charms 
too, and be sure of it, with one such harem we shall make money 
in Italy.” 

‘And your poisons ?” 

“T shall sell them in greater quantity, I shall sell them more 
dearly. We must, when we return to France, have spent not one 
penny of our own, and reach home with a clear profit of two million 
at least.” 

‘“What route shall we take?” 

“I am powerfully inclined to go south again. Calabrian and 
Sicilian depravity, Juliette, is something that exceeds even your 
fondest dreams; I know those regions well, there are mines of gold 
to be earned down there. Last year I sold five hundred thousand 
francs worth of poison in the mezzogiorno, and would have done 
far better had I been able to keep abreast of my orders. The 
Southerners are credulous, like all other lying people; telling their 
fortunes, I was able to persuade them of whatever I wished. .. . It’s 
a fine country, Juliette.” 

“I for my part am anxious to return to Paris again,” said I; 
“established there, would we not lead a better life than roaming 
about in such a way? Could we not do the same things there?” 

“We must at least visit Venice, whence we can proceed to 
Milan and then to Lyon.” 

To this I gave my agreement. We dined. Durand told me 
that she wanted to pay all our expenses. She would, to be sure, 
reimburse herself from our jointly earned profits; but she entreated 
me to accept the appearance of being kept by her. To that too | 
agreed. I was, I must tell you, as tactful in receiving her attentions 
as she was in showing them to me. Delicacy also matters in the 
sphere of crime; failure to understand this points to a woeful 
ignorance of human nature. 

“Is it true,” I asked my new companion, “that you possess the 
balm that ensures longevity ?” 

‘No such balm exists,” Durand replied, ‘‘those who distribute 


1038 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


it are all quacks. The true secret to a long life is a sober and 
temperate life; sobriety and temperance not being among our 
virtues, we cannot, you and I, hope for miracles. And why should 
we, my dear? Better to live a little less long and to enjoy oneself : 
what would a life be divested of its pleasures? If death meant the 
onset of pain, then I would urge you to stretch your life out to the 
utmost; but since the worst that can happen to us is to slip back 
into the nothingness where we were before we were born, ’tis on 
the wing of pleasures we must fly through our apportioned term.” 

‘‘My love, are you then without belief in another life?” 

‘“T would be greatly ashamed to have to own to belief in such 
nonsense. But, fully enlightened as you are upon that and related 
questions, I doubt whether I have much to teach you thereanent, 
and I am confident that, imbued with the basic principles of 
philosophy, both the immortality of the soul and the existence of 
God are to your consideration extravagances not worth a minute’s 
thought. The falsity of all those doctrines being manifest, there is 
one which I construct upon their wreckage and it may perhaps claim 
to a certain originality. I base it upon a multitude of experiences. 
I maintain that what is taken for a naturally inspired horror of 
death is merely the fruit of the absurd fears which we, starting in 
childhood, develop regarding this total annihilation, fears initiated 
by the religious notions our elders stupidly cram into our young 
heads. Once cured of these fears and reassured concerning our fate, 
not only do we cease to behold death with alarm and repugnance, 
but it becomes easy to prove that death is in reality nothing more 
nor less than a voluptuous pleasure. You will admit, first, that one 
cannot help but be certain that death is one of the necessities of 
Nature, who does not <reate us save to die; if we begin, it is in 
order to end; each instant advances us nowhere but toward that 
terminal point; everything indicates that death is Nature’s final 
and sole aim. Now, I ask how it is possible to doubt, in the light 
of acquired experience, that death, as a natural necessity and as 
something needed by Nature, can be anything else than a pleasure, 
since all palpable evidence proves convincingly that every one of 
life’s necessities is pleasure-producing. Therefore, I reason, there is 
pleasure in dying; it is therefore possible to conceive that, with 
reflection and with philosophy, one may convert into very volup- 


Juliette & 1039 


tuous ideas all death’s ridiculous frights, and that sensual excite- 
ment may even bring on thoughts of death and induce in one an 
eager expectancy of death.” 

“That doctrine, entirely new, and not without plausibility,” 
I said to my friend, ‘‘would be dangerous to publish. Think of how 
many people are held in check by nothing except fear of death 
and who, once liberated from that dread, could calmly—” 

“One moment,” said my delightful friend, “I have nevet 
sought to discourage anyone from crime; rather, I have always 
toiled to remove all the obstacles stupidity has strewn in its path. 
Crime is my element ; Nature brought me into the world to advance 
its cause, and my task and ambition are to multiply to infinity all 
the means to commit it. 

“The trade I have elected and which I exercise more out of 
libertinage than from material necessity, proves my extreme desire 
to promote crime; I have no more ardent passion than that of 
propagating it generally, and if I could envelop the whole world 
within my toils, I would blast it to dust without hesitation or 
remorse.’ 

‘And against which sex does your libertine fury plot with 
greater delight ?” 

“It is not a person’s sex that arouses me, it is his age, his ties 
with others, his condition. When. the suitable factors are found 
in a man, I extract greater enjoyment from immolating him than a 
woman; when they converge in a woman, the preference goes 
automatically to her.” 

‘‘And what are these standards of suitability ?” I inquired. 

‘T ought not tell you.” 

“Why not?” 

“From these confessions you will draw no end of fallacious 
inferences, likely, subsequently, to have a damaging effect upon 
our relationship.” 

‘Ah, my dear, you have already said enough: I am then to 
assume that your favors are so many condemnations to death?” 

“Certainly ; have I not told you so? Listen to me, Juliette, and 
put your fears away. Far be it from me to disguise the fact that any 
object I use for the simple and unique purpose of consumption, and 
with which I enter into no other relationship, must undergo the 


1040 «se THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


fate of any other commodity. But if, on the other hand, in that 
object { encounter sympathetic intellectual traits, imaginative qual- 
ities such as those I have found in you, then, be assured of it, rather 
than severing connections with such an object, I do but tighten them 
by every means at my command. In the name of the most tender 
affection, cease, my love, :o harbor doubts; I offered you the surest 
guarantee of my good faith, you decline it out of tact, do not leave 
me to suppose now that your mind is at odds with your heart. 
Besides, have I any powers you yourself do not dispose of ?” 

‘Most assuredly you do,” I answered, ‘‘and I am far from 
knowing the whole range or subtlety of your capacities.” 

‘‘As you like,” my friend said, smiling, ‘‘but be persuaded 
that this art of mine shall, with you, be put to no other use than to 
constrain you to love me.’ 

‘‘Ah, count upon it; I realize that between villains there is 
never any conflict, and believe me, but for the awful suspicions you 
stirred up in me, I would never have sacrificed Clairwil.” 

“Do I detect a notz of regret behind that avowal, Juliette?” 

“Not at all, not at all,” said I, showering kisses upon my 
friend, ‘‘let us have an end to the discussion thereupon; I give 
myself into your keeping, I repeat it, you can place your trust in my 
heart as I put my reliance in yours; our strength is in our union, 
and nothing will dissolve it. Now tell me the rest of what I am 
eager to hear about the factors which incite you to the consum- 
mation of crime: I am anxious to find out whether they concur with 
mine, and so far I notice great similarities.” 

“I told you that age had a great deal to do with it: I love to 
wither the plant at the noon of its perfection: between fifteen and 
seventeen years old, that is the stage at which I consider roses 
fittest for gathering, especially when they are in flawless health 
and when Nature, whose purposes I know how to cross, seems to 
have designed the object to live in exuberant well-being to the end 
of a long and happy life. Ah, Juliette, how I enjoy performing 
such interventions! Ties irritate me also: I delight in depriving a 
father of his child, a lover of his mistress.” 

‘SA tribade of her handmaid ?” 

“Why yes, little rainx; is it my fault if unfathomable Nature 
made me the rascal I am? If it is to me the object belongs, then 


Juliette 2 1041 


the pleasure is twofold. I also said that the person’s condition con- 
tributes significantly to the excitement of my imagination: here, 
I am partial to the two extremes, wealth and high estate, or 
obscurity and misfortune. Generally speaking, I aim, when striking, 
to produce as many disastrous aftereffects and melancholy reper- 
cussions as possible, I like it to cause much weeping, I discharge 
at the sight of those tears. Their abundance or bitterness brings 
forth my fuck, the harder and more copiously they flow, the more 
powerful my spasm.” 

“Oh, gentlest, most charming friend,” said I, my head be- 
ginning to reel, ‘frig me, I beseech you; you see what your words 
are doing to me; I have never known anyone whose attitudes were 
in closer harmony with my own. Next to you, Clairwil was a mere 
child; you are what my happiness demands, you are the woman I 
have been seeking, never leave me again.” 

And Durand, to take fullest advantage of my ecstasy, having 
helped me to a couch, frigged me with three fingers as I had never 
in my life been frigged before. I replied in kind; I sucked her 
clitoris; and when I spied her asshole opening and closing like a 
flower thirstily responding to the sweetly descending dew, I put 
on a dildo and flung into her bum, frigging her still while I em- 
buggered her. That vent was of unprecedented diameter. My 
instrument had a girth of eight inches, a length of twelve; I but 
brought it up and it vanished out of sight. And when it was gone, 
then the whore let loose oaths, she shuddered and shook like a 
lunatic; and well I saw that if Nature had excluded her from 
knowledge of the common kind of pleasures, she had richly com- 
pensated Durand in bestowing upon her the extremest sensitivity 
to these. One of my new friend’s outstanding talents lay in her 
ability to give pleasure while receiving it; she was so supple, so 
elastic, that even as I embuggered her, she wound herself like a 
vine around my body, succeeded in kissing my mouth, and in 
inserting fingers into my fundament. Sometimes forgetting every- 
thing else in order to concentrate upon her sensations alone, she 
would then curse with greater vigor than I had ever known in a 
person; and from whatever angle one considered this remarkable 
woman, one discovered that, child of crime, of lust, and of infamy, 
every last one of her physical and moral qualities contributed to 


1042 ce THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


making her the most exceptional libertine of her century. Durand 
wanted to do for me all I had done for her. She embuggered me 
and, lewdly frigged by her, I comfortably withstood the same 
dildo, I discharged thrice in response to its blows; and, I say again, 
I had never had dealings with a woman who so grasped the art of 
giving pleasure. 

From there we returned to drinking, and when we were very 
high, “Come,” Durand said to me, “‘let us go out into the streets 
and befoul ourselves with a little libertinage. Let us go and see 
the funeral preparations that have been made for the fifteen-year- 
old girl, a lovely creature, whom I poisoned yesterday at the 
solicitation of her father who, after having nicely fucked her, 
wanted to be revenged for an indiscretion she then committed.” 

We went out costumed in the manner of the courtesans of 
the country; night had fallen. 

“Before anything else,” said my friend, “I suggest that we 
betake ourselves down to the harbor and frig a few sailors; we 
ought to be able to uncover some monsters. You simply would not 
believe the pleasure I find in squeezing the juice out of those 
sausages. ...”” 

“For shame, whore,” said I, kissing her, “‘you are tipsy.” 

“A little, perhaps. but do not conclude that Bacchus’ aid is 
necessary to light the fies of libertinage in me. Divine powers are 
ascribed to that rascal, I know, and I never undertake lewd exer- 
cises in a better mood than when I have stuffed myself upon delicate 
cooking and fine wines; but without those stimulants I am perfectly 
capable of overstepping: the last limits of decency and modesty— 
you shall see.” 

No sooner did we reach the port than a host of sailors and 
stevedores crowded around us. 

“Holla, good friends,” Durand cries, “no hurlyburly, behave 
yourselves and fret not, we are going to satisfy you, every last one. 
Here, look at this girl: she is French.’ She entered the business only 
yesterday; and now she is going to sit down on that bollard, she is 


1 Whores of that nationality are greatly sought after in foreign lands. Their 
extreme indulgence, their accomplishments, their libertinage, and their beauty have 
won them a position of privilege among the world’s harlots, who in other countries 
are almost always ugly, inept, and unclean.

going to lift her skirts, and she is going to offer you whichever side 
best suits your tastes; and I am going to frig you upon her charms.” 

This speech was applauded by the throng. The first of at least 
fifteen suitors wants to see my bare bosom: his uncouth attentions 
might have spoiled its appearance had not my companion forbidden 
him any gestures; he had therefore to restrict himself to covering 
my breasts with fuck; they were shortly awash. The second wants 
me, sitting on the bollard, to spread my thighs as far apart as 
possible, in order that he can be frigged against my clitoris. I prove 
unable to resist the massiveness of the member whose tip, guided 
by Durand, nuzzles the approaches to my vagina; impelled by an 
involuntary reflex, I leap forward and incorporate it up to the 
height of the balls. No sooner does the funny chap feel himself 
caught than he clutches me in his arms, lifts me up, lifts up my 
skirts and exhibits my ass to the whole assembly. One of those 
frenetics advances, claps his hands to my bum, palpates it, spears it, 
and there am I, carried by two partners, the object of both their 
caresses and homages. 

“Hold,” says Durand, “give her something firm to take 
purchase upon’”—and, with those words, she puts an enormous 
member into each of my hands. ‘What an engaging group,” the 
bawd observes, presenting her behind to a fifth seaman. “Here, 
my friend, here is my ass, let us include ourselves in the scene, 
form one of its episodes; I cannot, alas, propose you anything else, 
Nature is to blame for my disability; but reassure yourself, the 
heat of my asshole and its narrowness will make you forget any 
craving you may have for my cunt.” 

Other postures were struck betimes. I dealt with better than 
fifty of those low fellows. My companion rubbed them with a water 
just prior to penetration, and by that means I was able to receive 
them all without fear: I was fucked forty-five times in less than 
three hours. Durand did nought but essay them; she fetched them 
up to me afterward, and they terminated, according to their choice, 
either in my ass or in my cunt. The lewd thing sucked practically 
everything she could get her hands upon, since she had a palate 
for pricks, and was not, need I remind you, a woman to curb her 
tastes. Our bandits once satisfied, we must drink with them, for 
that was the custom. 


1044 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘And it is one of the best parts of all,” Durand murmured 
to me, ‘‘you have no idea how, in vile company, I relish plunging 
into whatever is characterized by swinish intemperance, filthiest 
debauchery.” 

When we were done feeding it was because neither of us could 
swallow another mouthful. We had devoured not one, but two 
huge meals, paid for by those scoundrels, twenty of whom had 
contributed two sequins apiece, which came, all told, to nearly 
five hundred francs. During that banquet we drank, we ate, we 
let ourselves be handled, pawed, fucked, and we besotted ourselves, 
in fine, to the point where, the two of us sprawled on the floor in 
the center of the tavern, we gave ourselves to that mob upon strict 
condition that they first vomit, piss, and shit all over our faces, 
before sticking us. They all consented to those terms, and by the 
time our nasty orgy was ended, we were half-drowned in urine, 
ordures, and sperm. 

“Children,” said my companion once order had been restored, 
“it now behooves us to make ourselves known to you and, in 
recognition of the fine supper you have given us, to make some 
samples of our merchardise available to you. Among you would 
there be anyone with a personal grudge to settle, or some vindic- 
tiveness to express? We are going to supply him the means. Pur- 
veyors of the best poisoris in Italy, specify your requirements to us, 
and upon whom the product is to be used.” 

Would you believe it, my friends? (for, oh, just heavens, what 
progress humankind has made in depravity) a clamor rose up, and 
with one voice they begged us to be liberal in the distribution of 
our baneful gifts; and there was not a single one who lacked, so he 
claimed, a most excellent purpose to put them to. All were provided 
for; and that libidinous soirée may perhaps have rendered us the 
cause of sixty murders. 

“Come,” Durand said to me, ‘the hour is not late, further 
adventures may be awaiting us. And I have the most positive urge 
to go and verify the success of my pretty little fifteen-year-old’s 
death.” 

And so we bade our hosts farewell after having embraced 
them warmly. 

Reaching the square in front of the cathedral we came at once 


Juliette & 1045 


upon a funeral procession. In Italy it being the tradition to expose 
the dead in their caskets, Durand had no trouble identifying the 
features of the lovely child upon whom her venom had done its 
work. 

‘There she is, there she is,” she whispered excitedly, ‘‘oh, fuck 
my soul! let’s stand over here in the shadows and frig each other 
as she goes by.” 

“Rather than that,” I said, “let’s precede her into the 
cathedral; we will station ourselves in a chapel and do what you 
suggest while watching the burial.” 

“The final is the better moment, you are right,” said Durand; 
“quick, let’s go in.” 

We were fortunate enough to find a secluded spot directly 
behind the confessional in the very chapel where the young body 
was to be laid to rest. We shrank back against the wall, and there 
we stood, fingering each other’s organs while the ceremony went 
forward, and timing our movements in such a way that no fuck 
would escape us until, the casket having been lowered into the 
vault, our discharge could, after a fashion, serve as holy water 
unto the deceased. All was soon over, the priests and mourners 
withdrew; but the work of sealing the tomb was left incomplete, 
and we saw that the gravedigger either had intentions we could 
not yet divine, or preferred, in view of the late hour, to come back 
and finish his masonry the next day. 

“Ha!” said Durand, “let us linger here, an incredible whim 
has just entered my head. ’T was a pretty creature they buried, eh?” 

“Well?” 

“We'll pluck her out of that tomb, my dear, you'll frig me 
upon that delicious face, beautiful still despite the funereal darkness 
gathering upon the brows. Say, are you afraid?” 

“No.” 

“Then let us stay.” 

By and by the church is closed. We are alone in it. 

‘How I like this lugubrious silence,” said Durand; “how it 
invites to crime, how it quickens the passions—it reflects the stillness 
of the grave. And, I tell you so, death puts the thrill of lust in me. 
To work.” 

“Stay,” I murmured. “I believe I hear sounds.” 


1046 hb THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And we hasten back to our niche. Ye gods! what did we 
perceive? Someone else was beating us to the treasure; and who? 
Heavens above, what execrable depravation! The father himself 
was coming to gloat over his abominable deed, he was coming to 
consummate it; the gravedigger preceded him, a lantern in his hand. 

“Lift her forth,” he was told by the father, ‘‘so great is my 
grief that I must once again take her in my arms before losing her 
forever.” 

The casket reappears, from it the body is removed, then laid 
out by the gravedigger upon the steps of the altar. 

“Very good, my friend, that will do; leave me for a time,” 
says the incestuous and barbaric author of that charming girl’s 
days, “I wish to weep undisturbed. Let me shed my tears at my ease, 
you may return in two hours’ time, and I shall reward you for your 
zeal.” 

The doors are closed again. 

Oh, my friends, how am I to describe the horrors we wit- 
nessed? Describe them I must, however: they are aberrances of 
the human heart I am exposing, and I am bound to unveil its 
every nook and cranny. 

Although the church had been locked shut, for added safety 
the rascal barricades hiraself inside the chapel, lights four tapers, 
places two at the head, two at the feet of his daughter, then draws 
away the shroud; and she lies naked before him. Unspeakable 
quiverings of pleasure then take possession of him; his twitching 
muscles, his hoarse respiration, the upstanding prick he trundles 
into sight, everything paints the ignited state of his soul. 

‘“‘Damn my eyes!” he cries, “there it is, the thing I did... 
I repent me not... . Go, 'twas not your waggling tongue I punished, 
but my villainy I contented; the idea of killing you stiffened my 
prick, I'd fucked you a little too often, now I am pleased.” 

Wherewith he approaches the corpse; he fondles its breasts, 
he jabs them with a pin. 

“Bah, she feels nothing anymore,” he mutters; “‘a pity, she 
feels nothing. Was I in too great a hurry? Bitch, how many other 
torments I'd inflict upon you were you yet alive!” 

He spreads her th.ghs wide apart, he pinches her labia, he 


Juliette < 1047 


pricks the interior of her womb and, feeling his erection at its peak, 
the villain encunts her, lies down flat upon her, kisses her mouth, 
does what he can to thrust his tongue inside it, but cannot, for the 
contractions induced by the poison have locked tight the child’s 
jaw. He withdraws, turns the corpse over upon its belly and allows 
us a sight of the loveliest buttocks one can hope to behold. Ardently 
he kisses those hindquarters, vigorously he frigs himself. ‘‘Ah,” he 
exclaims, “how often have I fucked this celestial ass, how many 
various pleasures has it procured me over the past four years!” 

He thén steps back, gazes down at the body meditatively, 
circles it two or three times, repeating the words, ‘Beautiful 
corpse ! Beautiful corpse !”” 

And as the uttering of that phrase lifted his prick afresh and 
caused it horribly to swell, we concluded that corpse-fucking must 
be his passion. Again he kneels down between his daughter’s wide- 
flung legs, he rekisses her lovely ass a thousand times over, pricks it, 
bites it, applies furious slaps to it, even tears away a piece of flesh 
with his teeth, and sodomizes. Here, as it appeared to us, his 
delirium reaches its culminating point; he gnashes his teeth, he 
foams; and, drawing a long knife from his pocket, while he dis- 
charges he cuts off the head of this cadaver, then readjusts himself. 

We observed there, philosophically, the state of the man of 
firm principle when he has just completed the satisfaction of his 
ruling passion. A fool, with before him nothing but the object of 
his rage and his lubricity, obliged to wait amidst the silence and 
the horror of the tombs, would have shuddered, infallibly. Our 
villain, calm, gathers up the battered debris of his daughter; he 
packs the pieces back into the casket; he even remains a short while 
down in the vault, doing we have no idea what. "Twas then that 
Durand, who throughout the whole of this performance has not 
ceased to frig herself or to frig me, suggests that we push the 
stone slab into place over the vault and entomb this man along 
with his victim. 

“No,” I say, “he is a villain, and we owe all villains our 
respect and protection.” 

“Yes, to be sure,” she agreed; “but we may at least give him 
a scare. Quickly, lie down on the exact spot his daughter occupied 


1048 t+ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


a moment ago, and in the same attitude; let that be the sight greet- 
ing him when he emerges from below. Powerfully impressed he 
will be, the effect should about drive him to distraction.” 

Its unusualness seemed to me to require that the prank be 
played. 

The libertine reappears, and the first thing his eyes light upon 
is my well-exposed ass. So startled was he that he staggered back- 
ward, and all but toppled into the vault whence he had arisen; and, 
indeed, he was saved from doing so only by my friend, who caught 
his arm; and at her toach he almost swooned away from terror. 

“Cordelli,’ Durand said to the libertine, who was trembling 
from head to foot, “be not alarmed, you are amidst friends: I am 
she who sold you the poison you employed so successfully, and in 
this pretty girl behold someone of the most amiable disposition 
and ready to give you all manner of delights, providing that they 
differ from those we have just watched you procure yourself.” 

‘You have taken me strangely by surprise,” the tradesman 
said. 

‘Never mind, my friend, compose yourself: we saw you and 
we admired you. I ask you to admire this splendid ass, it is there 
to serve you: five hundred sequins and it is yours. And bear in mind 
also that this superb creature is no ordinary woman.” 

“Indeed, it is an agreeable behind,” Cordelli admitted, fond- 
ling it; “but I am in limp condition: you saw the discharge I 
produced a short while ago.” 

‘“‘A reparable loss,” Durand declared, “‘you shall be up again 
in no time, believe me. I have a lotion in my pocket, its effects are 
unfailing. Where do you wish the scene to take place?” 

“In that vault; let us all descend there, I cannot tear myself 
away from my victim’s remains, you’d find it hard to believe, the 
degree to which they inspire me.” 

We made our way down into the sepulcher. 

Cordelli no sooner lifts away the winding sheet, he no sooner 
claps eyes upon his unlucky daughter’s vestiges, than his prick begins 
to stir again. Durand rubs his testicles with the lotion she had 
mentioned, then she frictions his member. I show him my behind, 
he reaches for it, socratizes it, kisses my mouth, and the erection 
is complete.

“This young lady will have the kindness,” says he, “‘to place 
herself in the casket. She will then be swathed in the shroud. We 
shall then go up to the chapel, the slab will be lowered for a few 
moments; I shall then, I am perfectly certain of it, discharge at 
the edge of the hole.” 

La Durand casts a glance at me; my answer was not slow in 
forthcoming. 

““We are inseparable, Signor,” I informed the tradesman, 
“it shall therefore have to be over the two of us you lower the slab 
for a few moments.”’ 

“Ah, dear Juliette, you want faith in me,” said Durand. “Go 
up then with Signor Cordelli, I shall stay below. And I commend 
myself to you, remember it, to you alone.” 

A second time | took counsel with myself. I worshiped Dur- 
and; I realized that even a sliver of mistrust must soon turn into 
a wedge driven between us. There was the risk that they leave me 
buried alive? Offsetting it was the gravedigger’s eventual return. 
And if nothing happened, if all went well . . . how my confidence in 
my friend would be reinforced! what tranquillity ever after! 

‘“‘Nonsense,” I declared; “and to prove to you, my love, that 
I am incapable of doubts in your regard, I stay here. Proceed, 
Cordelli, do what you like; and for my acquiescence the price is 
one thousand sequins.” 

“The sum shall be yours,” the tradesman promised, “I appre- 
ciate unconditional docility, yours shall be recompensed.” 

The scraps of the daughter are cleared from the casket, I 
install myself in it; Cordelli envelops me in the shroud; and he 
presses three or four kisses to my asshole. “Ah, the beautiful 
corpse,” he sighs, walking around me several times; after which 
he and Durand mount the stone stairs leading to the chapel. 

I confess it, a deathly chill penetrated me unto the very 
marrow of my bones when I heard the slab fall heavily into position. 
And now? I wondered. Helpless, I am in the power of two very 
wicked villains. Strange blindness of libertinage, whither shall you 
lead me! 

But this ordeal was necessary. 

I leave you to imagine how my uneasiness increased when 
stirrings up above announced the removal of the barricade with 


1050 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


which Cordelli had blocked the chapel; and when those movements 
were succeeded by utter silence. 

So, I said to myself, you are doomed. Perfidious Durand has 
betrayed you. And I fel: all my body laved in a cold sweat, from 
my scalp down to my ankles. Then, plucking up courage, I reasoned 
with myself: Softly, saic. I, let us not despair, ’tis no act of virtue 
you have just committed. Were that the case, well might you quake; 
but vice alone is concerned here, and so what can you possibly 
fear? 

Such were my thoughts when the noises characteristic of 
Cordelli’s discharge were heard; the stone was lifted away; and a 
moment later Durand was bending over me. 

“Tt is all over, my angel,” said she, “‘you are free and here 
are your thousand sequins. Will you suspect me in the future ?” 

“Never,” I cried, “never, forgive an irrational impulse: it 
was directed far more at Cordelli than at you. But let us get our- 
selves away from this place, I am faint from lack of fresh air.” 

A weary Cordelli, whose bubbling sperm formed a puddle 
upon the slab, was sitting on the steps of the altar, awaiting us. 
We made ready to go; the gravedigger appeared, Cordelli paid 
him, and we left the cathedral. Durand wanted to spend the rest 
of the night in my bed. 

“That episode has forged bonds between us,” I said to my 
companion, “it seals ou: friendship forever, our mutual trust. It 
has rendered us inseparable for life.” 

“T told you so,” Durand replied, “our arms combined will 
bring much hurt to others; but never a scratch either to you or to 
me.” 

“Is it not true,” said I, “that had you had some other woman 
with you, she would have remained in that vault?” 

“For a certainty. And I swear to you that Cordelli offered me 
two thousand sequins if ] would agree to leave you there.” 

“Well,” was my response, “let us look about for a pretty 
girl, let us propose her to him and enjoy watching him repeat his 
performance.” 

“But you already have the desired girl.” 

‘‘Who then ?” 

“Elise.” 


Juliette & 1051 


“You are unfriendly toward my two maids, aren’t you! Is it 
jealousy ?” 

“No, but I do not like to see anyone near you whom you 
might think more attached to you than am I. Are you not just a 
little tired of the slut? I leave you the other one, but that Elise, 
surely you have had your fill of her by now? You cannot sleep at 
night unless it be between the pair of them? Why then, all that is 
required is that I take her place.” 

“Your project excites me but at the same time I find it dis- 
tasteful.” 

“Which is to say that it has everything in its favor,” Durand 
rejoined, “for great pleasures are only born from surmounted 
repugnances. Ring for her, let’s sport with her, silently decree 
her death while frigging her; nothing amuses me like such pieces 
of deceit.” 

“Ah, Durand, what a multitude of infamies you have me 
commit.” 

“Say rather what an infinity of delights I prepare for you.” 

Elise appears, beautiful as ever, thé very efigy of Love; she 
slips obediently into bed between us; Durand, as yet only imper- 
fectly acquainted with her, takes extreme pleasure in caressing the 
girl. 

“There’s a truly voluptuous creature, upon my honor,” says 
the rascal, scattering kisses upon her, “have her lie on top of you, 
Juliette, and be tickling her clitoris while I embugger her. Oh, what 
an inspiring ass, how our good tradesman is going to fancy these 
peerless buttocks !” 

And the lewd thing, tonguing the anus lodged betwixt them, 
shortly introduced her little device thereinto. Stretched out upon 
Elise, and consequently upon me as well, she sucked our mouths by 
turns. 

“Twelve hours in a row I have been engaged in libertine 
activities,” she said, ‘‘and I ought by rights to be exhausted; but 
not at all, I feel as though nothing could abate my ardor.” 

“And, do you know, I feel the same way. ’Tis our scheme,” I 
added in a lowered voice, “which particularly heats me, Durand, 
electrifies me. The two of us, let's discharge over that delicious 
idea.’ And as I was frigging Elise most dextrously, and as Durand 


1052 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


was sodomizing her to perfection, the little dear was the first to 
discharge. Sensing the spasm occur, Durand set to spanking her 
ferociously; she withdrew from Elise’s ass and, swearing like one 
of the damned, scolded the poor soul for having upset her by 
discharging. 

“The duty of a victim,” she told her harshly, “is to accom- 
modate; she must never venture to partake of any pleasure what- 
ever. You.are a jade, you are a hussy, and a whipping will teach you 
to create disturbances for me.” 

I hold the victim and the villain has at her for a quarter of an 
hour. Elise was familiar with this mania, she had frequently had 
to put up with lashings from me; but never before had she received 
one so violent. 

“You are going to spoil her behind,” I pointed out, 
tomorrow Cordelli—” 

‘He values such disfiguring marks, they bring him to erection.” 

And, while the libertine remained intent upon her work, the 
blood continued to course down Elise’s legs. The storm did finally 
subside, Durand embuggered me and, while in the pass of discharg- 
ing, wanted to have the girl’s tattered buttocks within the reach of 
her kisses. 

“A divine creature,” she pronounced when her spasms were 
over, ‘exactly what we need. And you, my fairest of fair, say, 
have you discharged ? Forgive me for paying so little heed to your 
pleasures: when in the throes of delirium I tend to inconceivable 
self-centeredness.” 

“Oh, my dear, I have been at least as happy as you; see how 
wet my cunt is.” 

‘And your brain? Was it affected by the thing too ?” 

“Overwhelmed.” 

We got back into %ed, Elise between us; I blew out the candle. 
Before drifting off to sleep, Durand put her lips to my ear: “I 
relish few thoughts,” she said in a whisper, ‘more than that of 
lying the night with an individual who is certain to die the next 
day thanks to me.” 

Durand called upon Cordelli early the following morning. 
Enchanted as he was by such an agreeable proposition, a bargain 
was quickly struck, the life of the ill-starred Elise was sold in 


(33 


and

exchange for a modest thousand sequins; but Cordelli meant to 
encompass the deed by refinements, and as I am about to relate 
this sinister adventure to you, rather than tell you of them ahead 
of time, I shall let these details come out in the course of the drama. 

While my companion was off negotiating I had ordered Elise 
put in a state of readiness. She was bathed, freshened, perfumed, 
and once art had seconded the gifts of Nature, that beautiful 
girl, not yet eighteen years old, emerged radiant as an angel. 

Durand returned and advised me that Cordelli expected us at 
five o'clock that same afternoon. “Tis to transpire at one of his 
country properties, in a castle by the sea three leagues outside 
Ancona; and,” she said, “I believe I can assure you that the 
scene will be rousing. Now let us have lunch.” 

Elise and Raimonde, as usual, were at table alongside us; 
twas there we announced to them that they were to be separated.. 

“Elise,” said we, “has caught the eye of a rich tradesman in 
town. Her future is assured; she is to stay here at Ancona.” 

The two friends melted into tears. Then, throwing herself into 
my arms, “Dear lady,” Elise cried, sprinkling me with tears and 
kisses, “‘you promised you would never abandon me. .. .” 

And it was then, my friends, that I was able to measure the 
vibrations set up within a libertine soul when lust enters into 
collision with sensibility. I stiffened inwardly against the girl’s plead- 
ings, I found pleasure in braving her tears, in refusing to allow 
her entreaties to act otherwise than as a spur to my lubricity. , 

“But, my dear,” I replied to that exquisite creature, fending 
her off, pushing her back to her chair, ‘‘would I not blame myself 
forever if I were to stand in the way of your fortune?” 

“I want no fortune, Madame, I ask for nothing but the favor 
of remaining with you until my dying day.” 

“Elise,” said Durand, “are you then so very fond of Juliette?” 

‘Alas, Madame, but for her I would not be alive today. It was 
she who rescued Raimonde and me from a brigand who would with- 
out any question have massacred us otherwise, and when gratitude 
is added to the heart’s natural feelings, you understand, Madame, 
that nothing but impassioned friendship can be the result.” 

“Be all that as it may, you must take leave of each other,” said 
the unkind Durand, “and very promptly too.” 


1054 «% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Within me a storm was brewing; Durand detected it. 

“Take her into another room,” my companion murmured to 
me, “I shall stay here and have Raimonde frig me.” 

No sooner was I alone with Elise than I felt all my senses 
transformed by fury; that beautiful child kissed me as she wept: I 
abused her; and feeling my fuck flow with the first blows I dealt 
her, I struck with redoubled force. 

“In truth,” I said icily, ‘‘your sentiments surprise me, for I 
feel none even distantly resembling them. It may be that once upon 
a time I did not behold you with total indifference; however, I am 
weary of you today. If I have kept you for the past three months, 
lay it up to charity.” 

“To charity, Madame!” 

“Why yes, were it not for my pity, what do you suppose you 
would have turned into? A streetwalker. Therefore thank me if I 
have taken the trouble to procure somebody for you, and express 
your gratitude by frigging me.” 

I removed her clothes, I pored over her charms; to contem- 
plate them in that frame of mind all but slew me with delight. How 
it thrilled me to be able to say to myself: In three days’ time, this 
glorious body will be the prey of maggots, and the credit for its 
destruction shall be mine. 

Divine spark of lust! inexpressible delights ie crime! Ah, 
what ravages you produce in the nervous system of a libertine 
female! Elise! Elise, thou whom I didst once dote upon, I deliver 
thee into the hands of thy butchers . . . and doing so, I discharge. 

Striving to persuade me that, once gone, she would be sorely 
missed, how the cunning little thing redoubled her attentions! It 
was not long before they obtained triumphal results; she was 
sucking while socratizing me, I shot a flood into her mouth; I then 
did for her what she hzid done for me. I adored the idea of drown- 
ing her in pleasure before handing her over to death. She dis- 
charged, then burst into tears, addressing the most tender words 
to me, the most urgent entreaties, supplicating me not to send her 
away. She could more easily have moved a mountain. Once I was 
sated, ‘“Come,” I told her, “‘it is time to leave.” 

She thought to go to her room to pack together her belongings. 


Juliette 2 1055 


“Don’t bother,” said I, “we'll send your things to you tomor- 
row.” 

She casts herself into my arms .. . I repulse her, I slap her 
face hard; she bleeds. I believe I might have strangled her there 
and then had it not been for our agreement with Cordelli. 

We went back into the salon. Durand was not there; I heard 
sounds in the adjoining room and went to peer through the key- 
hole. Heavens! what was my surprise to spy a man embuggering 
Raimonde, and Durand flogging the fucker. I knock . . . I ask 
leave to enter. 

“Is it you?’ Durand calls out. 

“Why, of course; open the door.” 

A finger to her lips, she bade me come in quietly. “It’s 
Cordelli. . . . He insisted upon seeing the girl you had in store for 
him; I did not want to disturb you, so I gave him Raimonde for 
the time being. As you see . . . he’s embuggering her. He seems to be 
mad about her, Juliette.” 

‘Pray do not interrupt anything on my account, Signor,” I 
hastened to say to him, “simply remember that she is not the one 
you have contracted for.” 

“And I am dreadfully sorry about it,” the rake replied, his 
words punctuated by gasps of pleasure, “I am dreadfully—sorry 
—for her ass—the most beautiful ass in creation, the—tightest 
fitting—oh, with this there are—wonders to be achieved. How- 
ever,” he went on, backing out of the breach, “I shall not discharge, 
*twould be wiser for me to husband my forces. There,” said he, 
wiping his prick, recovering his breath, “let us talk business for 
a moment.” 

Raimonde retired from the room; and the three of us, 
Cordelli, Durand, and I, drew up chairs and sat down. 

‘My impatience got the better of me,” he explained; “I 
arrived just as you were getting up from the table, Madame Durand * 
told me that you were amusing yourself with the one reserved for 
me. Seeing Raimonde with our friend, I formed a desire to have 
her, and I must own that the having of her made me regret that not 
she but the other one is to be my victim. ‘’Tis Juliette’s favorite,’ 
Madame Durand informed me, ‘Juliette will never agree to part 
with her.’ Mademoiselle,” the seducer continued, taking hold of

my hand, “listen to me. I am a generous man to deal with; | own 
millions, having for the past twenty years pocketed every penny of 
the profits from the celebrated Senigallia Fair:? a few thousand 
sequins more, a few thousand sequins less, trifles I do not deign to 
take notice of when my passions are at stake. I do not know 
Elise; but I know your Raimonde, she pleases me infinitely. I have 
seen divine behinds in my day, I never fuck any save the warmest 
and the snuggest. This ;irl must be superb in distress; and, to put 
it simply, she is one of the most suitable women for victimization 
I have beheld in years. This then is what I am going to do: Sight 
unseen, I shall take the other one, because | said I would, and I 
shall take this one too, in this case knowing what I am getting: will 
six thousand sequins be acceptable for the pair?” 

“Hardly,” I replied, feeling greed, love of gold crowd every 
other sentiment out of my heart. ‘“T'wenty thousand sequins and you 
get the two of them.” 

“But,” Cordelli reminded me, “I have already bought one 
for a thousand.” 

“Consider the bargain broken; I sell them together or not at 
all, and I am not going to let them go for anything under the price 
I just named.” 

“T can only approve my friend’s decision,” Durand put in; “‘it 
strikes me that you are lucky to obtain the darling of her affections 
so cheaply.” 

“A girl I worship, and | sell her to whom? to a villain who 
intends to kill her!” 

“Yes indeed,” the Italian admitted, ‘‘and to kill her to the 
tune of ghastly tortures, I assure you.” 

“Well, such amusements must be paid for, Signor. Make up 
your mind, for let pity reassert its rights in my heart and you'll 
end up with nothing.” 

“Your merchandise is expensive, Mademoiselle,” the trades- 
-man observed. “But, damn my eyes! you catch me at a moment 
when the heat of lust puts right reason to rout. Show this voucher 
to my bookkeeper and he will immediately disburse the funds. In 
the meantime let us have a look at the other girl.” 


2 The most famous in all Italy. 


Juliette e& 1057 


“Scoundrel,” I whispered to my friend, “this is another ex- 
ample of your work. You seem to be determined to leave me no- 
body.” 

“Oh, Juliette, for that blame nought but my love; think not 
that you shall ever regret having lost everybody else, for in having 
me you shall have more than a whole world.” 

And she went off to collect the money. 

I summoned Elise. 

“Charming!” the rake exclaimed once he clapped eyes upon 
her. “Little wonder that you ask such a figure for such an article.” 
And hastening to undress the girl, his enthusiasm but rose when 
he was able to admire her charms in their entirety. He submits that 
delicate and sweetly modeled ass to a searching examination; he 
kisses it indefatigably, spreads it, tongues it, fucks it, comes forth 
to kiss it anew; and ardent though they be, the caresses he lavishes 
upon it, he cannot tear himself away from the divine object. 

‘‘Have the other one come in, we shall compare the two side 
by side.” 

Raimonde appears and, soon just as naked as Elise, she offers 
her examiner everything needed to facilitate his observations. The 
scrupulousness wherewith he proceeds is not to be imagined: the 
buttocks especially claim his narrow-eyed attention. While he 
concentrates upon his study I lay a light hand to his member, frig 
him slowly; his hands stray now and then to my buttocks, which 
he fondles while thrusting his tongue into my mouth; and then he 
embuggers Elise, while slapping us smartly, Raimonde and me. 

“Truth to tell, the one is worth no less than the other,” he 
confides to me in private, “and both are delightful. I shall cause 
them much suffering.” 

“Which, in your view, is the better ass ?”’ I asked him. 

“Oh, Raimonde’s, no doubt about it,” he replied, kissing that 
lovely personage with feeling; “better for temperature, better for 
fit... . Juliette, lie down upon that bed,” the insatiable libertine 
said, “I am of a mind to ass-fuck you also.” 

He has Elise station herself to my left, Raimonde to my right: 
he then kneads and pinches their two behinds while fucking mine. 
Then, abruptly breaking off contact, “Enough,” he says, “else I 
discharge. Time is passing; let us be on our way.” 


1058 <« THE MARQUIS:DE SADE 


The two girls retire to make themselves ready for the journey. 
Finding myself alone with the Italian, “Don’t deny it,” I say, “it 
was my companion who induced you to choose Raimonde. Eh?” 

“T shall not hide from you that she is eager to see her die.” 

“The vixen! ’Tis jealousy: a sufficient motive, in so far as 
I am concerned. Oh, never fear, my mind is made up, those two 
wretches must be treated infernally.” I was frigging him as I spoke, 
he was standing in front of me, I was rubbing his prick against my 
breasts, tickling his anus. ‘‘And,” I wondered, “exactly what form 
of torture are you reserving for them?” 

“You would not have it be mild ?” 

‘Ah, if it were up to me, their torments would surpass any- 
thing you can imagine.” 

“Delicious creature. .. . That is the way I like women to be; 
they are more ferocious than men if they will but give outlet to their 
aptitudes.” 

“Behind that lie natural reasons,” I answered, “their organs 
are more finely constructed, their sensitivity profounder, their 
nerves more irascible: barbarity is not a trait of the individual of 
inferior sensibility.” 

‘Precisely; and with a much keener imagination than the one 
we have, a woman canrot help but embrace excesses more avidly: 
which is why, in crime, women always go farther than we. Let a duel 
be announced, a gladiatorial combat, a public execution, and you 
see women flock to watch the spectacle; take a count of the on- 
lookers, each time you will find women outnumbering men ten to 
one. A great many focls,” the tradesman added, “dupes of this 
incredible faculty for feeling they notice in women, fail to realize 
that extremes coincide, and that it is precisely at the source of this 
capacity that cruelty has its origin.” 

“Because cruelty is in itself but an extension of sensitivity,” 
said I, “and because the great horrors we commit are always 
owing to the higher degree of our soul’s sensitivity.” 

“Listening to you, it is as though one were conversing with an 
angel, dear heart,” said Signor Cordelli; “kiss me and kiss me 
again, I am as much taken by your mind as by your charms. You 
ought to attach yourself to me.” 


Juliette & 1059 


“IT am inviolably attached to my friend,” I replied; “only 
death will sunder us.” 

“She would come with you.” 

‘No, we wish to see our native land again.” 

At that point I heard Durand’s footsteps. Going to greet 
her, I was able, as we stood out of range of Cordelli’s hearing, to 
learn of the pretty coup she had just executed. 

“I tampered with the voucher,” Durand told me. ‘“‘We have 
double the sum.” 

“Forty thousand sequins ?” 

“Yes, they are already locked safely away.” 

“Celestial creature!” 

“Do you regret the transaction now?” 

‘“‘Not anymore. But when Cordelli next sees his bookkeeper ?” 

“By then the crime will be consummated. One word of com- 
plaint out of the scoundrel and one word from us will have him 
broken on the wheel.” 

‘tKiss me, cleverest of friends!” 

“Come and take your half of the money.” 

“What need is there of that? Let us first attend to Cordelli; 
we shall divide our earnings when we return.” 

“I would like you to have the entire sum; it gives me greater 
pleasure to see you at the summit of opulence than to increase my 
own wealth.” 

And Cordelli having sent for us, we all set forth. After a 
several hours’ drive we reached the tradesman’s castle, a veritable 
fortress situated upon a spur of rock jutting out into the sea. By a 
little farm lying at the base of the rock the carriage drew to a halt, 
for the road went no farther. From that point on there were steps 
to climb, four hundred of them in all, these being the sole means of 
access to that redoubtable house. Before beginning the ascent we 
had to pass an iron gate, to which the tradesman had the key; 
there were six other gates like it at intervals along the stairway, 
and Cordelli opened and carefully closed each of them as we pro- 
ceeded up. Durand, noticing my expression of surprise gradually 
yield to one of alarm, saw fit to reassure me. To Cordelli she said: 
“Yes, the description you gave me of your house’s whereabouts was 
exact, and our servants, who will easily find the place, have instruc- 


1060 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tions to come to fetch us tomorrow morning if by ten o’clock we are 
not back in Ancona.” 

“Tam well known throughout the region,” said the tradesman, 
likewise eager, as it seemed to me, to put me at ease; “but you need 
not have troubled to give your orders, Madame Durand, you have 
my promise that we shall be returning to the city tonight, and you 
know me well enough to be sure that my word is my bond.” 

Our two girls were not so easily reassured. A kind of pre- 
monition always accompanies impending woe, the unlucky pair 
felt it in all its force, the knees of both were buckling from terror. 

A final gate is unlocked and then shut behind us; we are 
welcomed by two women of sixty. 

“Everything is ready ?” asks Cordelli. 

“Since this morning, Signor,” one of the women replies; ‘“‘we 
did not think you would te coming so late.” 

We advance; it is a rather somber, low-ceilinged hall we enter 
first. 

Cordelli moves to a window, draws the curtain aside. ‘‘Look 
where we are,” says he. 

And great was our astonishment to see that we were some 
three hundred feet above the sea, and nearly surrounded by water. 

“This rock describes a curve,” the Italian explained; “here, 
at its outermost point, we are about half a league from the main- 
land. One may make as much noise as one likes, there is slight 
chance of being heard by anybody.” 

We left that room, mounted a flight of stairs which brought 
us to another: in it the scene was to take place. 

Never perhaps had my eyes beheld anything quite so horrible. 
Upon a round dais located in the center of that room, itself 
circular, we made out, upon entering, all the divers instruments 
necessary to every known form of torture. Among them were some 
so execrable, so inconceivable and outlandish that I had never 
even dreamed of their existence. Two huge swarthy men, six feet 
tall, wearing fearful moustaches, of terrifying mien, naked as 
savages, stood at attention amidst that array of equipment, visibly 
ready to carry out the orders they were waiting to receive. Fifteen 
corpses of youths and young girls decorated the smoke-streaked 
stone walls of that evil den; and upon four stools surrounding the 


Juliette & 1061 


central dais were seated two girls of sixteen and two boys of 
fifteen, all in a state of absolute nudity. The old women, who had 
entered along with us, closed and bolted the doors; Cordelli 
glanced at us, relishing our astonishment. 

“This is where we are going to operate,” said he. “Rarely,” 
he observed for the sake of our two handmaids, “‘yes, very rarely 
does anyone leave this room having once come through its portals. 
Look sharply there, Dona Maria, have the clothes removed; 
start a fire; and let’s settle down to work without further delay ... 
I feel the fuck tingling in my balls; and seldom have I been in such 
a mood for horrors. 

“Juliette,” the lewd man said to me, “I appoint you my 
satellite, the general agent of my pleasures; undress and keep close 
by my side. Mindful of nothing but the service, of the imperious 
needs and wants of my prick and of my ass, you shall minister 
carefully to both of them during the entirety of the scene. If I 
call for a fucking, you shall wet my asshole with your spittle; with 
your tongue you shall moisten the pricks that are to sodomize me; 
you shall yourself introduce them into my behind. If I elect to fuck, 
you shall guide my tool into the holes I am moved to perforate, 
which you shall oil with saliva from your lips. At no time while 
performing your duties shall you neglect this capital detail] : once you 
have completed the oral preparation of whatever it may be, prick or 
ass, your mouth must be glued immediately to mine, and must suck 
it diligently and at length. Moreover, an attitude of deepest 
respect shall distinguish your bearing and govern your actions: it 
shall not be forgotten that no one is admitted into this place except 
slaves or victims. 

“You, Durand, shall lead the objects up to me, you shal] 
present them to me, and remember, both of you, to do nothing with- 
out first giving me your asses to kiss. 

“As for you,” he went on, addressing the elders, barearmed 
and naked from the waist down, wielding a handful of slender 
green switches, “‘you shall follow close after me, and you shall 
exert yourselves upon my flanks and buttocks at such times as, in 
your judgment, they may benefit from stimulation. 

“You, Bloodletter, and you, Barbaro, not only shall you 
fulfill your role as executioners, but you shall take all good care to 


1062 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


perforate my behind each time you see me present it to you 
amorously; Juliette then shall seize your engines and shall fetch 
them up and introduce them into my ass, conforming to the in- 
structions already given her. 

“As regards you young people who, seated upon these four 
stools, and in the most respectful silence, are awaiting what it 
pleases me to prescribe to you, submissiveness is your lot. Think 
not that the ties through which you are connected to me, since you 
are all four my offspring though begot of different mothers, think 
not, I say, that familia] ties are going to prevent me from dis- 
patching you upon a prolonged and harrowing journey to death: 
be advised that I only gave you life in order to be able to deprive 
you of it, that infanticide is one of the sweetest of my pleasures, 
and that it is the very nearness of our kinship that will ensure my 
delight in martyrizing you. 

“As for you, my lovely children,” he continued glaveringly, 
cruelly rallying my two women, “‘after what I have paid for you, 
no one will contest my right to do with you everything a more than 
ordinarily perverse imagination may suggest to me . . . and you 
can look forward to atrecious discomforts. I hope shortly to come 
to know all the effects of pain upon your sensitive constitutions.” 

Hearing those words, the unhappy creatures fell upon their 
knees before Cordelli. Already undressed by the duennas, their 
rich black hair floating in disorder upon their breasts of alabaster, 
their tears wetting the feet of the tyrant, all this lends an in- 
describably affecting quality to the spectacte of their grief and their 
despair. 

“Fuck my soul,” Cordelli says, sinking back into an armchair 
while I pollute him with one hand, socratize him with the other. 
“How fond I am of misfortune’s tragic effects, how they stiffen 
me... . Say, my pretty little jades, what if I lend you a dagger? 
You could stab yourselves or each other to death, I would not be 
unwilling to watch you clo it.” And as he spoke the monster laid 
brutal hands upon those two charming girls’ fresh and delicate 
breasts: he pinched them, compressed them violently, and appeared 
to glean uncommon pleasure from aggravating their mental suffer- 
ings by means of a quantity of little physical bullyings, inflicted, 
his hardening prick announced, to his lust’s advantage. 


Juliette & 1063 


“Bring me their asses,” he told one of the duennas, “adjust 
them so that the holes are on a level with my lips. You, Durand, 
suck me; Juliette shall continue to frig me as I lie in your mouth.” 

Thereupon he bit those two faultless asses and left marks of 
his teeth upon ten or a dozen different places. Then, slipping his 
head between Raimonde’s thighs, so fiercely did he chew upon her 
clitoris that the poor girl fainted. Enchanted at achieving such an 
effect, he began to subject Elise to the same trial; but the girl 
twitched, the knave missed the mark, his teeth clamped instead upon 
the lips of her vagina, a piece of which he carried away. Bruised 
and shocked though they were by these initial attacks, he wanted to 
fuck them both in that state. The order is given, the girls are laid 
belly down upon a long divan, their heads directly underneath the 
cadavers adorning the walls. And there, served by me, the rascal 
dipped alternately into their two asses and their two cunts, during 
a space of twenty minutes. After this, he found a bundle of 
switches, and having had one of the girls get down upon all fours 
and the other kneel upon her shoulders, in such sort that he could 
get at Elise’s divine buttocks and Raimonde’s exquisite teats, he 
martyrized those fleshy forms, now individually, now collectively; 
for better than thirty uninterrupted minutes he lashed them, all the 
while the duennas, kneeling behind his ass, belabored his buttocks 
with a silver hatpin. Elise and Raimonde exchanged positions, so 
that he could thrash her buttocks whose breasts he had just finished 
beating, and worry the breasts of her whose ass he had been 
molesting hitherto. When everything was bleeding profusely, 
basins of water were brought forward, wounds were stanched, 
and Cordelli, in furious erection, commanded one of his sons to 
come to him. In that delightful child all the gifts of a lavish Nature 
were combined: an enchanting countenance, a fine and fair skin, a 
pretty mouth, lovely hair, the most adorable ass. 

‘He does indeed greatly resemble his mother,” the rake 
observed, kissing the boy. 

‘What became of the poor soul ?”’ I asked the Italian. 

“Fie upon you, Juliette!” he replied, ‘“You are forever sus- 
pecting me of horrors, I sense it. Much surprised you would be, I 
dare say, if I were to produce the person for you right now.” 

“I defy you to do it.” 


1064 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Very well, there she is,” Cordelli retorted, pointing to one of 
the corpses suspended from a hook upon the wall; “that is the boy’s 
mother, ask him if you do not believe me. I depucelated the dear 
lad, here in this room, and that was scarcely thirty-six hours ago. 
Yes, here, as he lay in the arms of his loving and then living mother ; 
and shortly afterward, as he will confirm, yes, before his very eyes, 
utilizing a curious torture, I sent his mama to the place where 
today I am going, in a manner no less curious, to send his nabs, 
madame’s darling son.” And the rascal, polluted by me, grew in- 
ordinately stiff. 

He has one of the old women contain the child; upon his 
instructions, I moisten the gomorrhean orifice, I guide the shaft; 
Durand sucks Cordelli’s Ganymede from below, and the Italian 
embuggers while colling my behind. 

Nimble as ever, ever sufficiently in control of himself to 
strike deep and yet only graze the edge of pleasure, Cordelli, with- 
out it having cost him a drop of fuck, withdraws from this ass too. 

The other youth is Drought to him. The same ceremony, the 
same economy of sperm: and the tradesman having camped one 
atop the other, thrashes them both simultaneously. From time to 
time he pauses to suck a prick. Finally, impelled by a furious surge 
of lust, he bites the balls of the first-fucked, bites them so terribly 
that the child loses consciousness. Unperturbed, Cordelli moves on 
to other things. One of his daughters is led up; she was not a beauty, 
but about her there was something so mild, an air of modesty and 
innocence so irresistible that there was no refusing her one’s stint- 
less homage. 

“A virgin, that one,” said Cordelli, ‘‘of that there is no 
question; however, since I am no longer capable of catching an 
erection for a cunt, you,” he went on, nodding to the duennas, 
“shall lay her flat on this sofa, and hold her still.” 

And as soon as he has that pleasant child’s two voluptuous 
buttocks well in perspective, the sinner molests them, pinches them, 
and claws them with such speed and such force that they are all 
ableeding the next minute: therewith he embuggers. Thinking to 
have acquired from that ass the vigor needed to attempt the cunt, 
he presents himself before it; and, his illusion sustained by our 
libertine fingerings and kisses and yet more so by the asses we offer 


’ 


Juliette & 1065 


to his caresses, success crowns his efforts, he blasts the maidenhead. 
He withdraws an incarnadine member to thrust it home again into 
the sanctuary he prefers, and after a few more such mingled attacks, 
he comes back to discharge in the ass of one of the boys whom to 
this end he has kept nearby him throughout all his activities up 
until now. He discharges, I say. A clap of thunder, one would have 
called it. I thought he was going to shake the house down. We were 
clustered around him; he was kissing my buttocks, an old woman 
was flogging him, Durand was socratizing him, Elise was tickling 
his balls, he was pinching Raimonde’s ass, examining that of the 
little boy and that of the little girl posted ahead of him; in sum, 
everything, everyone, concurred in provoking a discharge the power 
of which is not readily to be described. 

“Fuck!” he exclaimed when he was done, ‘“‘the time has come 
for some horrors, they are indispensable if I am to get myself back 
into form.” 

“Then horrors you shall have, my friend, horrors you shall 
have,” said I, consoling his prick by mouthing it, by squeezing it, 
by carefully evacuating the very last drop of fuck fromi it.® 

Cordelli was grateful for these attentions. ‘The crowd en- 
circles him once again while I suck him; his mouth finds that of 
the girl he has just devirginated, one would have thought he 
designed to tear her tongue out by the roots, so forcefully did he 
suck it. By and by, who would believe it? through an incredible in- 
congruity, 'tis the fetid maw of one of the crones he fastens upon 
and tongues for a quarter of an hour; and the foul fellow abandons 
it only in order, with identical delight, to pump the mouth of that 
one of his executioners he signals for. This last excess is the 
decisive one: I begin to feel the effects of the miracle. Cordelli 
takes one of my hands and, placing it upon the villain’s instrument, 
I am awestruck at discovering that the article in my grasp Is 


3 Few men know how to have themselves cared for following discharge; ex- 
hausted, prostrated, they sneak off into a corner, listless and empty-headed. Neverthe- 
less, upon post-ejaculatory care depends the vigor necessary to tasting further enjoy- 
ments, and to emerging from former ones in a less collapsed state. This care consists 
in having oneself sucked without delay, in having one’s balls comforted and fondled, 
and in the application of very hot cloths. It is also helpful, after the crisis, to absorb 
restoratives, or spirituous liquors. The latter employed as lotions upon the testicles will 
also produce excellent effects. 


1066 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thicker than my upper arm and almost as long as one of my thighs. 

“Take that prick, Juliette,” the Italian says to me, ‘and 
steer it into the cunt of the little girl I have just deflowered. Keep 
in mind, if you will, that it must enter regardless of the conse- 
quences.” 

Initial attempts proving futile, there was nothing else to do but 
bind the victim; Cordelli ordered her four limbs secured by ropes 
made fast to the floor, ir: such sort as to ensure fair access to both 
her holes: thus, if his man failed to fight his way into one of them, 
he could take refuge in the other. I wheeled the engine into position; 
Cordelli was urging the champion on from behind; lean and hairy 
though those hinder parts were, the lecher tongued them content- 
edly, and looked to be ready to fuck them the moment that individ- 
ual’s enormous device was niched where he wanted it to be. By dint 
of skill we succeed: the prick penetrates into the girl’s cunt, and 
death’s livid hue upon her brow attests to the damnable state of 
her physique. Cordelli, however, his eye fixed upon that extra- 
ordinary tool, soon issues commands to make for the other port; 
I act as pilot. Jostled, strained in every fiber, Nature gradually 
yields to resolute pressure, as she always does; nevertheless, the 
anus splits, blood gushes forth, and the Italian, in seventh heaven, 
hanging in the fucker’s bowels, smites him from the rear as he 
himself smites to the fore. 

Oh, God of Justice! what contrasts! Imagine, if you can, 
that pretty little face, so touching, so sweet; that face being 
nastily kissed by the most unprepossessing and the grimmest figure 
of a man to be found anywhere on earth, his bristly moustaches 
withering the lilies and the roses in the loveliest possible complexion, 
and with execrable blasphemies replying to the plaintive entreaties 
of the most innocent soul. Picture, my friends, on the other side, 
the infamous Cordelli przferring, to the beauties surrounding him, 
that paid murderer’s loathsome bum; tonguing that vent, feeding 
upon it with the same ardor that would ordinarily have animated 
anybody else before a pretty and youthful novice; inserting his 
prick thereinto, and finally ordering Durand to strangle the victim 
when his man discharges. 

It all comes about: the unlucky child expires. And the Italian, 


Juliette sb 1067 


& 


debuggering, offers us a purpling, sharply risen prick, fit now for 
every kind of outrage. 

“There I am, back in fettle once again,” says he. ‘And 
there’s one of them dead already. I behaved with restraint, my 
friends, as you noticed; for I do not believe one could more mildly 
put a person to death.” 

One of the duennas thought to remove the corpse. 

“Do not touch it, buggeress!”” the merchant shouted, “those 
sights arouse me, how could you be unaware of the fact?” And 
the wicked man, pressing his face to that of his unhappy daughter, 
dares pluck hideous kisses from features twisted by death and 
reflecting, instead of the graces which used to play there before, 
only the convulsions of pain .. . only the contortions of despair. 

“Durand,” says the master of the house, “bring this man’s 
prick up again: I want him to be fucking me while I explore both 
the orifices of my remaining daughter.” 

Preparations are made. Cordelli embuggers; buggery was usu- 
ally his opening move. His man fucks him without preliminary oil- 
ings; what need of them had an asshole so amply proportioned ? 
Elise and Raimonde are there, he kisses their behinds, to his right 
and left he handles those of his two sons, whose pricks are being 
sucked by Durand and me. From ass Cordelli skips to cunt, and the 
objects beneath his fingers vary. His man discharges: he summons 
the other. That other, at least as well furnished as his colleague, 
but of still more fearful aspect, if that be possible, vigorously 
sodomizes his employer and fires a pair of charges into his funda- 
ment. The orgies begin to take on a serious note. 

“All right, by little Jesus’ buggér-fucked Father,” our host 
roars, very wroth, “crimes, I need crimes, I need abominations, 
upon them I depend for further ejaculations, and in the chapter of 
ejaculations my selfishness is such that should it cost the life of 
every damned one of you in this room, why I'd slaughter the lot 
without an instant’s hesitation to obtain a good discharge.” 

“With whom are you of a mind to start, villain?” I then 
ventured.-to ask. 

“With you... with some other .. . with I don’t care whom; 
little does it matter provided it stiffens me. Bah, do you fancy there 
is anyone here whose life counts more with me than another’s?

Come, let us try this little siut,” the rogue said, catching the 
trembling Elise by one breast and dragging her thus along on her 
knees. He called for tongs, and while I frigged him, while one of 
the executioners immobilized the victim, and while everyone else 
formed a hedge of bare asses around him, the barbarian had the 
patience and the determination to nip the girl’s breasts to pieces, 
removing small bit by small bit until he had so perfectly flattened 
out her chest that not even a suspicion remained of the two snow- 
white mammaries which had been embellishing it a few hours 
before. 

This operation cornpleted, the victim is presented to him in 
another position; held by four persons, her thighs are spread to the 
utmost, and her cunt gapes perfectly within his view. 

“There we are,” says the cannibal, “I am going to toil awhile 
in the workshop of the human species.” 

I was sucking him this time; his tongs forage about for fifteen 
minutes, he buries them as far in as they will go. 

“Turn her over,” he cries. 

The most beautiful buttocks in the whole wide world are 
presented to him now, he pries them apart, his cruel pincers dis- 
appear into the anus and that delicate part is attacked with the 
same frenzy as the othe:-. And it is I, 1, once mad about this lovely 
creature, it is I who now exhort her assassin, who exhort him to 
treat her thus. Baneful inconstancy of the passions, whither then 
you can drive us! Had she been unknown to me, I might perhaps 
have felt some indulgence toward that poor creature; but ’tis 
unheard of, what one invents, what one says, what one does, when 
disgust has withered the tender petals of the flower of love. 

Elise, swimming in her own blood, was breathing still; Cordelli 
contemplates her delightedly in her voluptuous agony; crime takes 
mighty pride in its works. Cordelli obliges me to frig his prick 
against the carnage he has wrought, he is thrilled to steep his 
member in the blood his hand has shed; and it is with a dagger he 
finishes off Elise. 

One of his sons replaces my tribade. Cordelli has the window 
opened on the seaward side of the room. The child is attached to 
a rope fifty feet long, whose other end is secured to a beam; and 
then the child is dropped. “Are you ready?” the author of his 


Juliette 1069 


days shouts down to him, exhibiting the knife with which he has but 
to slash through the rope: one quick gesture and the boy will 
disappear forever into a watery grave. From below rise the child’s 
screams; I frig his father; that father kisses Raimonde, he frigs 
one of his executioners while the other bum-fucks him,. stabbing a 
pin into his buttocks as he does so. The rope is pulled in, the child 
is retrieved; but he is not unbound. 

“Say, wert afraid?” asks the tradesman. ‘“‘Didst have a 
fright ?” 

“No more, father, for pity’s sake, for pity’s sake—” 

“Little bastard,”’ Cordelli sneers, “‘learn that the word father 
means nothing in my ears, nothing; I am deaf to it. Turn around: 
I must fuck you before feeding you to the fish. Yes, dear boy, to 
the fish, that is to be your fate: see what a powerful sway kindred 
ties exert over my heart!” 

The scoundrel embuggers: while he is busy afucking, an addi- 
tional length of rope is joined to the first one: this time it will be a 
two-hundred-foot fall. Two or three lunges and Cordelli retires, 
nodding to the executioners who thereupon seize the child and hurl 
him bodily out the window, from a height, that is, of two hundred 
feet, a distance he has no sooner traveled than the rope, suddenly 
checking his descent, thoroughly dislocates his limbs at the point 
where he halts. From there he is hauled back up. Broken inside 
and out, the poor lad was entirely out of shape. 

‘Another bum-tupping,” said the Italian. 

‘‘Andthen another tumble,” said Durand. 

“Certainly ; but lengthened yet a little more, the rope will not 
interrupt his ride till he is twenty-five feet above the waves.” 

The re-fucked child is rethrown, recovered almost inanimate. 
His father fucks him for the last time; and when he is dangling 
ten feet above the surface of the water, “Ready?” the ferocious 
Italian bawled down to him; “your final moment is nigh.” 

And he cuts the rope; and the.sea at last provides the unhappy 
boy a haven of repose. 

“That passion,” I remark to Cordelli, ‘‘is one of the prettiest 
in my acquaintance.” 

“It heats you, Juliette ?” 

“Yes, indeed!” 


1070 eg THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Then give me your ass to fuck. That will soothe you.” 
Cordelli filed away in me for a quarter of an hour, plotting new 
pieces of mischief. Then ’twas Raimonde he called for. Her fate 
was writ in the Italian’s eyes, and she read it there at once. 

“Oh, dearest mistress!”’ she said, clutching at me with out- 
stretched arms, ‘‘is it then decided that I shall be surrendered to 
this monster? I who loved you so... .” 

Laughter was my only response. And his trusties having 
marched the darling thing up to him, the traitor began with some 
caresses; he fondles and kisses all her fleshy parts; he tongues, 
tickles the clitoris, embuzgers, hovers ten minutes in the depths of 
Raimonde’s bowels, and she is cast naked into an iron cage filled 
with toads, reptiles, snakes, vipers, rabid dogs and cats which 
have not fed for five days. The wretch’s shrieks, her contortions, 
her twitchings once the z.nimals got at her, her antics were beyond 
anything one can imagine; her pain, her distress were pathetic 
beyond anything one could believe. I was overcome by the sight; 
Durand was frigging me beside the cage, Cordelli, sucked by a 
duenna, was fucking nearby. It took but a moment for that multi- 
tude of creatures to swai'm over Raimonde, and the moment after 
that there was not a great deal of her to be seen. The beasts made 
for her tastier parts, breasts and buttocks vanished in less time 
than it takes to tell. The. unfortunate event occurred when, as she 
opened her mouth to scream, a viper slithered into her gullet and 
she choked to death, well before it suited our pleasures. At that 
critical instant the other executioner was fucking Cordelli, the 
rogue was sodomizing one elder while tonguing the asshole of 
the second, palpating my buttocks with one hand and those of his 
surviving daughter with the other, and Durand was frigging me 
amain. . 

“Ha!” exclaimed Cordelli, uttering a string of coarse oaths 
and jerking his prick rudely out of the duenna’s fundament, “I'd 
thought that by sodomizing this old pump I would avoid the danger 
of a discharge, and blast my ass! I am on the brink of one.” 

‘‘No, my dear, nothing of the sort must be allowed to happen,” 
said I, bending his prick head downward; “‘let us dwell upon other 
matters for a moment.” 

“Well,” said the tradesman, “what think you of the cage as a 


Juliette & 1071 


way to die, Juliette? I conceived of it for that slut the very first 
instant I saw her ass: it is enough for me to examine that part of a 
woman and her death sentence is dictated. If you like, Juliette, I 
shall inscribe yours upon your behind itself.” 

And as he was pinching it vigorously while speaking those 
words, I danced lightly out of his grip and, quick as a wink, for 
my own substituted the ass of his one remaining son. He fixes a 
terrible stare upon the boy, it is he whose mother the villain 
massacred lately, and who can still see her embalmed remains there 
upon the wall. 

“If I rightly recall,” said that incorrigible libertine, “I 
arranged to have this little beggar die by the same torture under 
which his mother perished, three days ago. First, the victim’s eyes 
are gouged out; then, his four extremities are lopped off; after that, 
his four limbs are broken; and he is definitively embuggered while 
an aide finishes him aff with a dagger.” 

“And that is what you subjected his mother to?” I asked. 

“Tt is.” 

“I have no objections to raise; I would merely suggest that, 
along with the rest, extraction of the teeth and extirpation of the 
tongue seem to be called for.” 

“Extraction of the teeth! Extirpation of the tongue! You 
are quite right, Juliette,” Cordelli replied, “I dealt too hastily 
with his dam the other day. But we shall not be so neglectful with 
her son. Ho,” said he, snapping his fingers to his executioners, 
“operate.” 

During the proceedings, it was my ass Cordelli perforated; 
ahead of him he had, as prospect, that of the girl whose torments 
were due to follow next. Durand showed him her ass to the right, 
and he had the spectacle to the left; the duennas flogged him. 

The deftness and the mastery those assassins displayed in 
their work can hardly be imagined, and it would be even more difh- 
cult to render an idea of the intensity of the victim’s sufferings or 
the violence of his outcries. When Cordelli noticed that one agent 
sufficed to the task, he ordered the other, splashed all over with 
gore, to come up and encunt me so as to improve his enjoyment of 
my ass. I was, God knows, accustomed to outsized engines, never- 
theless the intromission of that one occasioned me exceeding dis- 


1072 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


comfort. Although that man was superlatively ill-favored, the 
horrors he had been bathing in, the forthright way he took with 
me, the language he employed, the sodomite episode whereby his 
master was regaling me, everything soon combined to carry me off 
into transports, and I washed my fucker’s prick with the goodliest 
deluge of fuck. Cordelli, ecstatic at hearing my anthems of joy 
blend with the shrieks torture was wringing from his son, was over- 
whelmed; his sperm forces the sluices, and I am soaked at both 
ends. However, the boy’s doing to death was not yet completed; the 
executioner inquired whether he was to hang fire. 

“Of course not,” the Italian answered him. “People are 
strange,” he went on tc comment, “they always suppose that one 
cannot torment a creature unless one is aroused. As for me, I pro- 
test that I am a rational man, I act deliberately in passion as in 
everything else: Nature endowed my being with a thirst for blood, 
I have no need to be excited in order to shed it.” 

Work was resumed. 

However, to preserve the liveliness of the scene, I reheated 
his prick in my mouth, znd Durand stimulated him verbally. 

“Cordelli,” she advanced, ‘‘though impressive, your ferocity 
is inadequate.” 

‘“How so?” 

“Once you have done your worst, there shall yet remain worse 
to do.” 

“Prove it tome.” 

‘Easily. With your leave I shall myself organize the torture 
of your remaining daughter; and I am confident that you shall be- 
hold greater things than those your timorous imagination has 
devised so far.” 

“Go ahead,” the tradesman rejoined. 

“Utilizing implements I see there,” said my companion, “you 
shall have your man delicately peel off the girl’s skin. Once flayed, 
she shall be whipped with thorns; after that, rubbed down with 
vinegar; and the operation demands to be repeated seven times. 
The nerves finally reached, small nails, red hot, shall be planted 
in them; the body may then be deposited in a fiery brazier.” 

“Marvelous,” Cordelli said. “I agree to it, Durand, but I 


Juliette @& 1073 


warn you: if it fails to make me discharge, I will subject you to the 
same torture.” 

‘‘As you like.” 

“To work.” 

The little maid is led up. "Twas the prettier of the two. The 
unlucky creature had the loveliest possible figure, superb golden 
hair, a virgin’s look, and eyes whereof Venus herself would have 
been envious. The unkind Italian was moved to kiss that charming 
little ass yet again; for, as he said, ‘I must pay my respects to it 
one last time before my barbarity causes its roses to fade. Ah, my 
friends, own that it is a lovely ass!” 

And, profoundly stirred by the horrors impending, Cordelli 
soon passes from encomiums to deeds. 

The girl is embuggered and after several charges the villain 
quits the field in order to relish as a bystander the cruel sight of his 
henchmen’s more massy members perforating this pretty little 
posterior. Essay is made; but, as you surely realize, success is 
obtained only at the price of the total demolition of the anus. 
Cordelli, while this was going forward, was sodomizing the execu- 
tioner; the other one has at the cunt of the young person who, 
treated in that hard fashion, gives us the image of a lamb in the 
clutches of two lions. Greatly affected by the scene, the profligate 
flits from the ass of one executioner to the ass of the other and, at 
last esteeming himself sufficiently heated, commands the torture to 
begin, appointing Durand its supervisor. 

Again, words are not enough to describe the sufferings of the 
poor child once the Italian took his bundle of thorns to the new skin 
which came to light when the outer layer had been removed. But 
it was something else again when that second skin was removed 
and the third lashed; the wretch’s shudderings, the way she ground 
her teeth and squirmed were infinitely pleasurable to see. Cordelli, 
remarking that I was frigging myself while watching, himself lent 
a hand to tickle me; but, absorbed by his victim’s torture, he en- 
trusted the masturbator’s role to Durand, and my friend, quite as 
aroused as I, asked for the same attentions she was lavishing upon 
me. The operation lasted a considerable while, we discharged three 
or four times during it; all the creature’s epidermal wrappings 
were taken off without direct damage to her vital organs. Matters 


1074 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


became far more grave when the nerves were attacked with the 
heated nails. Her screams rose in pitch and volume; she was 
equally inspiring to see. Cordelli decides to embugger her in that 
appalling state; he makes the attempt, succeeds, and continues to 
drive home the nails all the while he sodomizes her. Excess of pain 
at length consumes every thing still keeping her alive, and the miser- 
able child expires upon receiving her assassin’s fuck in her bowels. 

An icy seriousness then characterizes his features and his bear- 
ing. He dresses himself, has his executioners don their clothes, and 
together with them and the duennas he departs into an adjoining 
room. 

“Where is he goinz?” I asked Durand, with whom I found 
myself alone. 

“T have no idea.” 

“And if he is schem'ng something? If it is to be our turn now?” 

“It would be to get: what we deserve.” 

“Durand, I am confounded. How can you have taken it upon 
yourself to come to this house without being better acquainted with 
its owner ?”’ 

“He is rich. The hope of getting his. gold seduced me, it 
seduces me still. I am persuaded the rogue has his wealth cached 
somewhere hereabouts. ‘Could we but put him out of the way, and 
rob him. .. . I have some powder with me, its action is swift. An 
instant and the thing would be done.” 

“Such a deed, my dear, sorts ill with our principles: to respect 
vice eternally, to smite virtue only. By destroying this man, we halt 
a criminal career and’ perhaps save the lives of thousands, of 
millions, of creatures: ought we to do it?” 

“Juliette, ‘tis true what you say.” 

Cordelli reappeared, followed by his escort. 

“Ah, good sir, we were wondering where you have been,” said 
Durand. “Off performing some secret infamy, I venture to guess.” 

“You are mistaken,” the Italian replied, opening a door com- 
municating the room where we were and the one into which he had 
penetrated by another entrance; ‘“‘there,” he continued, showing us 
an oratory adorned with all the attributes of established religion, 
“there is where I have been. When one is in such a woeful case as 
I, who surrenders to the temptations of dreadful passions, one must 


Juliette & 1075 


undertake at least a few good works to appease the inevitable 
wrath of the Lord.” 

“Right you are,” said I, ‘allow us to imitate your excellent 
example. Durand, come with me, we are going to beg God’s for- 
giveness for the crimes this man has induced us to commit.” 

And closing the door, we shut ourselves up inside the oratory. 

“Damn me,” I said to my friend, whom I had led thither only 
in order to discuss affairs with her in privacy, ““damn me if there’s 
not a change wrought in my ideas, and if that fool of a fanatic 
merits anything else than to die. Scruples were misplaced here: with 
his weak-watered soul, that bugger will not long persevere in vice; 
who can tell, these we have been witness to may perhaps be his last 
ventures into that domain. We are in a position to take the straight 
way with him, and at once.” 

“T foresee no difficulty in ridding ourselves of the entire pack,” 
Durand observed. ‘It would be well, however, to preserve one of 
the old women, for we need a guide. Believe me, this tradesman has 
his treasure hidden somewhere under this roof; we shall find it, 
never you fear, and the find will be important.” 

“There are those servants who will be coming to fetch him 
this evening.” 

‘They shall be given refreshments to drink.” 

We rejoined the others. 

“‘Now here we are as blessed as you,” we said, “‘but, for God’s 
sake, give us,some refreshment—we are dying of thirst.” 

Immediately, upon an order issued by Cordelli, the two crones 
serve a good meal to the master and his acolytes. At the third glass 
of wine, Durand skillfully seasons first Cordelli’s plate, then his 
two executioners’; there was no way of envenoming the duennas, 
who were partaking of no food. In a trice the powder produced the 
expected effect, and our three villains toppled out of their chairs as 
though felled by Divine Vengeance. Durand sprang upon the more 
agile of the two elders. ‘‘Away,” she cried, stabbing her to the 
heart, “go join your unworthy accomplices; had your master been 
an authentic rascal like ourselves, he would have been saved. But 
seeing that he believed in God, I had no choice but to send him to 
the Devil. As for you,” Durand said to the other one, “if we let 
you live ’tis upon express condition you cooperate with us. We 


1076 <f& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


shall start by throwing these bodies into the sea; and then, con- 
ducted by you, we shall search this castle from top to bottom. There 
is treasure about, we are after it. Tell us first, are there any other 
people here ?” 

‘“‘Now? No, Mesdames,” the trembling crone replied, “I am 
the only domestic left in the house.” 

‘What do you mean by that? There are other masters ?” 

“I believe,” said she, “that there may yet be some victims. 
But promise you will spare me, I shall show you every part of the 
house.” 

Before turning to anything else we disposed of the corpses. 
While dragging them to the windows and pushing them out, we 
asked the old servant whether Cordelli had been in the habit of 
coming here frequently. 

“Three times a week,” she replied. 

‘And hideous massacres each time ?” 

“You were able to judge of his behavior. Come,” she said 
when we had completed our first chore, “I shall take you down to 
the dungeons. There may still be some game in the larder.” 

’Twas there, one hundred feet and more underground, the 
villain kept his provision of victims locked away. Each was in a 
separate cell: of twelve cells we found nine occupied: five lodged 
very attractive girls ranging between fifteen and eighteen years of 
age; boys of between thirteen and sixteen were confined in the other 
four; most of these vict.ms had been debauched and ensnared in 
different Italian cities; however, two of the girls, one of sixteen, 
another of eighteen, were natives of Ragusa in Albania, and they 
were exquisite creatures .ndeed. 

In the midst of examining them, sounds reached us, faraway 
but distinct; we hastened up to find out what was the matter. It was 
the arrival of our servants and of Cordelli’s, climbing the stairway 
to the castle. We received the Italian’s valets first, they were three 
in number : we bade them enter the dining hall, still littered with the 
remnants of our meal, we offered them wine to drink, and by means 
of the swift-acting powder we soon reduced them to the rank of 
their former master. Descending then to where our help was wait- 
ing, ‘‘Go back to town,” we told them, “we intend to spend another 


Juliette & 1077 


twenty-four hours here. Cordelli is retaining his servants, we need 
no others.” And our carriage left; we returned to the captives. 

As we were poring over them, “Durand,” I said, “I am 
pleased to come by these two Albanians, they will fill the gap now 
that Elise and Raimonde are gone; and my reply to the signs of 
discontent I already notice in your expression, my reply, I say, is 
that I shall sacrifice them whenever you wish, just as readily and 
just as easily as I did their predecessors.” 

“Women. Must you forever be surrounding yourself with 
women?” 

“I cannot do without them. But I need only one heart; ’tis 
yours alone I aspire to keep forever, my treasure.” 

“Flatterer, one must yield to all your little whims!” 

Lila, that was the name of the sixteen-year-old, and Rosalba 
were therefore released at once, but placed none the less under 
lock and key in one of the castle’s finest chambers. Those poor girls 
had been a week in their insalubrious dungeons, ill-fed, with only 
straw to lie upon, and ’twas plain to see, the experience had shaken 
them severely. Both were still in a state of frightened shock; but 
when I kissed them, caressed them, tears came to their eyes and 
they hugged me, showered me with kindnesses. They were sisters 
as it turned out, daughters of a rich trader in Ragusa with whom 
Cordelli had been in correspondence; he had persuaded their father 
to send them to Venice for their education, and the scoundrel in- 
vented a report of their death, thereby was he able to make them 
his. 

“I am going to do the same,” said Durand, “‘and take one of 
those girls.” 

“Do so, my dearest,” said I, “‘that is not the sort of thing that 
can ever provoke my jealousy.” 

“Monster!” said Durand. ‘“‘The more delicate of us two, I am 
loath to have anything distract me from the cherished idea of you.” 

“Cease, my love, cease to mistake carnal pleasures for moral 
distractions,” said I. ‘I have already told you that my doctrines, 
while they may be different from yours, are unshakable withal; 
that I could fuck and frig myself with every inhabitant of this 
planet, and still not for an instant be weaned away from the tender 
sentiments I have sworn to preserve for you as long as I live.” 


1078 << THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


We installed the three other girls and the four boys in the 
hall of tortures, and after having amused ourselves with them for 
half the day, we refined the horrors Cordelli had committed and 
caused those seven to perish under circumstances a thousand times 
more cruel. That accomplished, we slept for two hours and then 
resumed our searches. 

‘Precisely where he keeps his money I am unable to tell you,” 
said the old woman, “nor indeed do I know for a certainty whether 
there is any here; but if there is, it should be in a cellar near the 
one where he stores his wine.” 

We went down. Two stout bronze doors barred access to 
those cellars; and we had no tool to force them. However, the more 
difficulties we encountered, the greater, needless to say, grew our 
determination to surmount them. After much hunting and prowling 
about we discovered a little window which gave into that cellar, and 
which was protected by only two iron bars. By common impulse we 
both sprang forward anc. peered through: inside, we made out six 
great chests: you may imagine how our zeal redoubled at the sight. 
At length we manage to loosen and pry out those bars. I scramble 
through the window, in a state of keenest excitement I lift the lid 
of the first of the chests. Alas, what is our disappointment to dis- 
cover that those huge coffers contain nothing but instruments of 
torture or articles of women’s clothing. Furious, I was ready to 
abandon the quest. But Durand was not yet willing to admit defeat. 
“There must be something else in here,” she insisted; “let us look 
patiently.” 

I reach into the chest again; my fingers touch a ring of keys, 
One of them bears a tay: Key to the Treasure Room. 

“Ah, Durand! No need to waste our time in this cellar, what 
we seek lies elsewhere, this tag proves it. First we find doors with- 
out keys, here now are xeys but no doors. Dona Maria, is there 
anything you can say to help us? Only speak up and your fortune is 
made.” * 

‘For the life of me, there is nothing I can tell you. Only that 
if we continue to search we may find something.” 

“Go fetch me a twig from the hazel tree I saw growing in the 
courtyard,” Durand ordered. 

When the old woman returns with it, my friend takes the 


Juliette <6 1079 


twig lightly between thumb and forefinger and gazes at it atten- 
tively. For a moment the little stick hangs motionless. Then its 
free end rises, drawn to the left by some hidden suasion; Durand 
walks down a long gallery at whose end we come to another door. 
I try the keys; the door opens; the twig then gyrates rapidly be- 
tween Durand’s fingers. There were ten enormous chests in that 
room and, indeed, they were not women’s garments we found in 
them, nor instruments of torture, but coins, coins of purest gold, 
several million of them. 

“Splendid,” said I, full of courage and joy, ‘“‘we have simply 
to carry it away.” 

It was easier said than done. To call in the aid of the domestics 
would be to beckon to trouble. Impossible to lift those chests, to 
transport them out of the castle. They had therefore to be 
emptied. Before the choice facing us, we preferred to carry off 
less but to carry it off in greater safety. The old duenna, the two 
girls, Durand, and I, we each filled a sack with as great a load of the 
loot as we could bear, and from then on, for eight successive days, 
proceeded to remove Cordelli’s hoard. We gave it out that he was 
spending the month at his country seat, that he had invited us to 
come every day to be his guests; in the meantime we chartered a 
vessel for Venice..On the ninth day we went aboard, after having, 
while upon our last trip to the castle, cast the duenna into one of 
the cisterns, burying our secret by drowning it with her. 

During the voyage the weather was superb, the sea very calm, 
the attentions of our women excessive, their flesh excellent: thus 
rested and in high spirits we arrived at Venice. 


Incontrovertibly, it is a magnificent and imposing sight, that 
of a vast city floating upon the waters; as Grécourt somewhere says, 
it seems as if sodomy has chosen Venice for its citadel and inviol- 
able asylum, there to be able conveniently to extinguish, in the 
circumambient sea, the pyres wherewith fanatism might undertake 
to punish it; certain it is that unto sodomy this place provides 
sectaries without number whose devotion to the cult is outdone by 
the population of no other town in Italy. 

In Venice the air has a languid, caressing quality, conducive to 


1080 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


thoughts of pleasure, but often unwholesome, especially when the 
sea is at low tide; the wealthier citizens then go to spend as much 
time as they can upon the delightful estates they own on the main- 
land or on the neighboring islands. Despite this uninvigorating 
climate many are the venerable persons one sees among the in- 
habitants, and Venetian women age not so quickly as elsewhere. 

As a.rule, the Venetians are tall and comely, their physiognomy 
is cheerful, their manner spirited, and this far-famed nation de- 
serves to be loved. 

I devoted the first days after our arrival to investing my 
newly acquired assets; notwithstanding Durand’s entreaties that I 
keep all of Cordelli’s goid for myself, I insisted that we divide it 
equally. Our shares amounted to enough to earn each of us an 
annual return of roughly one million five hundred thousand livres; 
this, added to what I already had, brought my yearly revenues to 
around six million six hundred thousand pounds. But lest such a 
sizable fortune cause us to appear suspect in Venice, we took all the 
steps necessary to create the belief that our affluence was.the product 
merely of our charms and of the effects of our magical arts upon the 
simple. We opened our doors, in consequence, to everybody of the 
one sex and the other who was seeking voluptuous entertainment 
or instruction. Accordingly, Durand had built a laboratory and a 
cabinet with special mechanical effects along the same lines as the 
one she had formerly had in Paris. It was fitted with disappearing 
floors, sliding panels, boudoirs, dungeons, and everything that can 
deceive the eyes and impress the imagination. We hired some 
elderly female servants, who were speedily trained in all these 
maneuvers; and our two young Albanians were under orders to 
lend themselves, with alacrity, complacency, and submissiveness, to 
whatever chores either cf us might assign them. You will recall that 
they were virgins; that fact, coupled with everything we could 
reasonably expect from their charming faces and their youthfulness, 
enabled us to hope that those two little properties would produce 
rich yields once they had been brought under intensive cultivation. 
Moreover, I was to be at their side, and to resume all the old 
brothel exercises you saw me practicing years ago in Paris, when I 
first entered the career; the which, here in Venice, I was taking up

again out of sheer libertinage, for mine were not necessitous cir- 
cumstances—I believe I have made that plain to you. 

The first individual to present himself at our house was an 
old procuratore of San Marco who, after a narrow inspection of 
us all three, threw the handkerchief to me. 

“Perhaps,” was.his tactful opening, ‘‘my taste might incline 
me toward the choice of one of your maids, but my pronounced 
debility would prevent me from enjoying the delights she offered 
me. I shall surely be more at ease with you, and I shall now explain 
what our commerce will involve. 

“You shall be so good,” the nasty fellow said to me, “as to 
apprise me of the date when your menstruation will be at fullest 
spate: we shall meet upon that day. With you lying on a bed, your 
legs wide-flung, I shall kneel before you, I shall sip the wine, I 
shall fuddle myself upon those menses I adore: and when from 
bibbing them I become very high, I shall conclude the sacrifice in 
the same temple where I have been worshiping, while one of your 
domestics—and the function cannot be entrusted to anyone save 
one of your female servants—will have the kindness to thrash me 
with all the force she can muster.” 

“Good my Venetian Lord,” I replied, ‘“‘does your Serenity 
propose to repeat this lewd scene frequently, or is to be staged but 
once ?” 

“Once,” the Procurator replied; ‘‘beautiful as you are, my 
angel, when a woman has satisfied this passion with me, I am in- 
capable of renewing our acquaintance.” 

“Certainly, Excellency. Very well,” I said, “including supper, 
for a guest of your distinction never amuses himself in our house 
without honoring us with his presence at supper, ’tis one of our 
rules; including supper, then, and the whipper, that will cost you 
five hundred sequins.” 

“You are expensive, Mademoiselle,” said the Procurator, ris- 
ing to his feet; “but you are pretty, and so long as you are young 
you are right not to sell yourself for nothing. Upon what day am 
I to come?” 

“Tomorrow: that which you are fond of is beginning today, 
the inundation will occur tomorrow.” 


1082 sb THE MAR@UIS DE SADE 


“T shall be here without fail,’ the Procurator assured me. 

And having, the next day, satisfied his foul passion, having 
had him drubbed with a bull’s pizzle, I received his disgusting 
homage, by which I feigned to be deeply moved, nay, overwhelmed. 
For my pay, over and above the five hundred sequins, I got a 
diamond worth at least twice that sum, and whereof the old rascal 
made me a gift in appreciation of my good manners. 

A very wealthy merchant named Raimondi was my next 
suitor. 

“Dear heart,” said he as he examined my behind, ‘“‘is your ass 
intact ?”’ 

‘Most assuredly, Signor.” 

“Young woman,” he went on, spreading my buttocks, “‘you 
are telling me fibs; think not to impose upon a man who has my 
extensive knowledge and inveterate habit of asses.” 

‘Ah, Signor, I shall conceal nothing from you . .. merely once 
or twice, not more, upon my honor. .. .” 

And, without replying, Raimondi inserted his tongue into my 
asshole. He bade me stand up. He was all afire. 

“Listen,” said he, ‘‘I am going to explain my passion to you: 
you either take it or you leave it if it does not suit you. My whole 
pleasure consists in watching others fuck, that alone inspires me, 
without that wonderful spectacle I will not, I cannot accomplish 
anything. You will find me six handsome men who will one after the 
other encunt you before my eyes; I amuse myself with them while 
they fuck you, and when they discharge into your cunt, I carefully 
recuperate and meticulously swallow everything they have deposited 
in your vagina: your art consists in performing the impossible in 
order to expel that everything into my mouth. This operation 
completed, you offer me your behind: I sodomize you while your 
six men embugger me by turns. Once the sixth has discharged, I 
withdraw from your ass, I place myself upon a bed; you squat 
above me, and you shit into my mouth, while one of the men tongues 
your cunt, a second your mouth, a third masturbates in front of 
me, a fourth sucks my prick, and while I frig the fifth and the sixth 
with my two hands. Your mard tumbles into my mouth, and I eat 
it; that is quickly done. Then I get up from the bed; you take my 
prick into your mouth, you suck me exactly; all six men then come 


Juliette %& 1083 


one by one and shit into mine: I swallow their shit, you swallow 
my fuck, there is the climax of the drama and its conclusion. But 
have a care, dear heart,” added the Venetian. ‘“‘Have a care, for 
this great undertaking I have outlined to you is fraught with perils, 
they are grave and in number they are three: firstly, there is the 
chance that, despite your best efforts, you fail to eject into my 
mouth the sperm you have received in your cunt; secondly, it 
means trouble for you if you do not swallow mine; thirdly, you 
will regret it if you are unable to shit. Now, it were well that you 
be advised that each of these delinquencies is punishable by a 
hundred strokes of the whip, to be meted out by one of my six 
men; thus by failing to expel the six discharges, by refusing to 
swallow my fuck, and by not shitting, you accumulate a total of 
eight hundred lashes; one hundred if you have committed only one 
fault; et cetera. Speak.” 

“Signor,” was my answer to Raimondi, “your passion is not 
of the easiest execution, it entails great hazards. I should therefore 
fancy that, taking into account all the accessories I am to provide, 
two thousand sequins would not be an exorbitant figure.” 

“Your beauty is the deciding factor, I agree to the price,” the 
merchant announced. 

We took appointment, and two days later I satisfied him. 

Not long afterward Durand summoned me for a nobleman 
whose mania was not quite so dangerous. My friend frigged him, 
in the meantime he licked my nostrils, the outside and the inside of 
my ears, my eyes, my clitoris, the interior of my cunt, my asshole, 
the intervals between my toes, and my armpits. After an hour 
devoted to that ceremony he ended by having me suck his member 
and by discharging in my mouth. Durand had given me a week’s 
notice in order that I might have myself in a state of readiness, that 
is, of appropriate filthiness, for the quality of that libertine’s crisis 
was strictly proportionate to the greater or lesser degree of un- 
cleanliness in which he found the various parts. 

He told the whole town about us, and we were besieged by 
clients. There was one who brought two Negresses with him. 
Naked and flanked by those two women, I was to submit myself to 
frigging at their hands: the contrast of black and white shortly 
took effect upon him. Once aroused, he fell to flogging the 


1084 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Negresses, and kept at it until the blood was flowing; I sucked him 
while he whipped; and then he whipped me. Then it was the 
Negresses’ turn: knocked about by the iron-tipped martinets and 
the bull’s pizzle they alternately used upon him, he finished by 
embuggering me while one of the black women sodomized him with 
a dildo and he molested the ass of the other. From that personage 
I stole a superb diamond while I was in the act of sucking his 
prick ; and apart from the gem, that extraordinary party cost him 
one thousand sequins. 

A more unusual one appeared. He had to be bound naked to 
a painter’s ladder; two of our servants thrashed him mercilessly ; 
Durand sucked him. Perched on the top of the ladder, I shat upon 
his uplifted face. When at length his prick had lifted too, we made 
him kneel, we acted as his judges, interrogated him, sentenced him 
to be broken. All the instruments were there; but the bar was of 
pasteboard. Durand attached him to the cross; I delivered the 
beating, he discharged under the blows, gave us five hundred se- 
quins, and fled off in confusion, ashamed to show his face to those 
with whom he had just indulged in such a peculiar caprice. 

Our girls were also brought out upon the stage. We sold 
Rosalba’s maidenhead eighteen times over, her anal pucelage 
thirty times; twenty-two times that of Lila’s cunt, thirty-six times 
that of her ass. And after having extracted six hundred thousand 
francs from the harvest of those four first fruits, we surrendered 
them to the secular arr. 

The French Ambassador wrote to me one day, requesting me 
to come to his residence with a girl, as pretty a girl as I could find. I 
bring him a child of sixteen, as lovely as daylight, and who, snatched 
from the bosom of a family she was fated never to see again, had 
cost me a veritable fortune. His Excellency has the two of us un- 
dress in a small chamber situated in the uppermost story of his 
house; in the center of that room was a kind of deep hole, which 
one might have taken for a well. The Ambassador has us both 
lean over the edge, ancl gaze down into the shaft, that we might 
appreciate its depth; he observes our behinds, prominently dis- 
played thanks to the posture we have adopted. 

“Suppose I were to push you in, both of you,” the lewd 
diplomat hazarded, ‘‘what would happen?” 


Juliette 2 1085 


“Why, nothing dreadful provided we fell upon thick mat- 
tresses.” 

“Ha! ’Twould be into Hell you would tumble, sluts; that 
opening is the mouth of Tartarus.” 

And as he pronounces these words, from the hole mount 
tongues of flame, meant to frighten us; we recoil. 

“That pit, Excellency, is it then to be our grave?” 

“No doubt about it, for I see your doom spelled out upon 
your asses.” He was kissing them, pinching them, while speaking; 
and the behind of the young thing I had brought him was especially 
molested, he bit it and prodded it with a long needle. Nevertheless, 
there was as yet no sign of erection in his prick, even though, in 
consequence of his instructions, I had been stroking and shaking it 
as hard as I could: “Fuck!” I heard the libertine exclaim, and saw 
him wrap his arms around my companion’s waist and lift her off 
the floor. “Fuck!” he repeated, ‘“‘what a pleasure to throw this 
baggage into the flames.” 

The threat was swiftly followed by the act, and immediately 
I had contrived to put some consistency into his tool, the rake flung , 
the girl into the hole. 

“Frig!” he cried, ‘frig! frig! frig, bloody-fucking whore,” he 
shrieked as some mechanism, released by the impact of the girl’s 
falling body, sent flames shooting up from below. 

Then, seizing a poniard as he feels his discharge impend, he 
himself leaps into the hole to stab the victim, whose screams notify 
me of her death. I did not see the Ambassador again; an old 
woman paid me, counseled me to hold my tongue, and we never 
again heard tell of tkat notable. 

We were saying to each other, Durand and I, how odd it 
was that no women had been among our visitors, when Signora 
Zanetti, one of the wealthiest and most profligate ladies in Venice, 
communicated with us: she invited me to call upon her. That 
splendid creature, thirty-five years old, represented in the flesh the 
Roman noblewoman portrayed in classical sculpture. What a 
heavenly countenance! It was that of a living Venus, it was her 
figure, it was the complete assembly of all the goddess’ graces. 

“T caught a glimpse of you at Santa Maria della Salute the 
other day,” that charming woman said to me. “Like myself, you 


1086 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


were there doubtless in search of some object of lubricity; for I 
credit you with intelligence, and nobody with any ever goes to such 
places except with lewd intentions. "Tis the custom here: the 
churches serve as our brothels. . . . Do you know, my angel, you 
are very pretty; are you fond of women?” 

‘How could one be indifferent to anything whereof you offer 
such an inspiring example ?” 

‘‘Ah, there’s the French gallantry; ten years in Paris gave me 
an understanding of that jargon. Please tell me frankly whether 
you like women, and whether you would enjoy frigging yourself 
with me?” 

“Yes, by all the gods.” And to lend weight to my words, I 
fling my arms around the neck of the beautiful Venetian and tongue 
her mouth for-a quarter of an hour. 

‘You are enchanting, my angel,” says she, fondling my 
breasts, ‘“‘and I am going to pass some delightful moments with 
you.” 

We supped, and voluptuous frolic of the most piquant order 
crowned our lewd evening together. The most libertine of females, 
Zanetti had a prodigious grasp of the art of giving pleasure; few 
hands had ever frigged me with comparable skill or results. When 
we had each discharged five or six times, had exchanged lechings, 
suckings, dildo-fuckings, had, in sum, exhausted all the resources 
of the most far-reaching sapphism, “We may now fuck,”’ my 
tribade said. 

She rang. 

“Have I any men out there?” she demanded of her chamber- 
maid, an exquisite hussv of eighteen. 

“Yes, my Lady,” was the reply, ‘“‘ten of them have been in 
attendance; thinking that perhaps Signora may not be needing them 
this evening, they have retired most regretfully, for they are in 
sparkling form.” 

‘Have you been handling them, buggeress ?”’ asked the lovely 
Venetian. 

‘Yes, my Lady, I have touched one or two, but there have been 
no discharges; Signora may verify this.” 

“Bring them in, rascal, I want to give my new friend a treat.” 


Juliette % 1087 


Rosetti promptly led in the ten young men, whose faces and 
figures I found much to my liking. The soubrette and her mistress 
furbish those weapons in the twinkling of an eye, and I find myself 
threatened by ten pikes, and it was all I could do to encircle the 
least of them with my two hands. 

‘Well then!” said Zanetti, naked, her hair floating free, her 
face flushed, “all this is yours to enjoy; where do you wish to have 
those pricks placed?” 

“Fuck!” I exclaimed, awed by the prospect, “scatter them 
about, one here, one there, everywhere. . . .” 

“No, my dear, the good things in life deserve to be desired,” 
she said, “content yourself with taking them in the cunt during this 
first round, that will excite you, you will then have developed a 
yearning for the rest; and leave matters to us.” 

Rosetti has by now undressed herself; she and her mistress, 
rubbing briskly, maintain our athletes in shining condition; and my 
lovely friend introduces them one after the other into my cunt. 
Between introductions the slut stretches herself upon me, gives me 
her cunt to suck while she sucks my clitoris, while the two youths 
embugger her, and the soubrette fits the prick of a third into the 
ass of the one fucking me. 

The pleasures I derived from this opening series of tuppings, 
ah, good friends, those pleasures exceeded anything you can 
imagine. Once all ten had given me a taste of their instruments, I 
rolled over and presented my buttocks; the embuggery was begun 
without the delaying of an instant; during it, my cunt was sucked 
by Zanetti, who was in a kneeling position and was heating a 
prick in either hand. My fucker was sodomized, and I was sucking 
Rosetti’s cunt, she was electrifying the tips of two pricks by 
frigging them against her bush, in such a way that I was alternately 
able either to suck her cunt or pump the pricks she was masturbat- 
ing. When all the pricks had taken a turn in my bowels, we con- 
solidated the tableau so as to form a single compact society. I lie 
upon my back on top of a man who embuggers me; another encunts 
me; with my right hand I facilitate the introduction of a third 
prick into the ass of Zanetti, who, lying upon a fourth, was receiv- 
ing a fifth prick in her cunt; with my left, I rendered the same 


1088 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


service to Rosetti, also being fucked before and behind; an eighth 
man was sodomizing my sodomizer ; a ninth was in Rosetti’s mouth, 
the last in mine. 

“There is still room for two more,” Zanetti declared; “‘you 
observe that the pair sodomizing me and my chambermaid could 
perfectly well, without unbalancing the scene, each have a prick in 
the ass. Thus, a group of fifteen might easily be formed, and if it 
followed the lines of this one, it would be even more delightful.” 

But overcome, sotted with pleasure, I replied only by further 
heaving of my flanks; and delirium submerging the thirteen of us all 
at once, ‘twas in a torrent of fuck we extinguished . . . or rather 
temporarily soothed our consuming lust. 

The whole gamut of postures was repeated with Zanetti as 
their center and prime beneficiary, and now playing a subsidiary 
role, I had the revitalizing pleasure of watching that rascal’s 
extraordinary antics. Sappho, Messalina, every precedent was 
dwarfed; twas a frenzy, a mindless, convulsive lasciviousness, a 
string of blasphemies so energetic, of sighs so impassioned, of 
moans so deep, and shrieks so shrill at the instant of crisis! Oh, I 
repeat, never had Venus a proselyte so apt, never was delirium so 
intense, never did whore disport with such abandon. 

But she was not content with that; after having fucked, now 
we must drmk, and we did so with the same immoderation: the 
chambermaid joined us at table, but the men were dismissed; and 
when the three of us were raving drunk, we fell to frigging one 
another anew, like sluts. until the morning sun peered in upon our 
saturnalia, at last obliged us to suspend them and in rest seek the 
strength necessary to begin afresh. 

Several days later, that charming personage returned my 
visit. I had, she afirmed, made a prodigious impression upon her, 
she could not get the thought of me out of her head. 

‘‘Now that we are better acquainted, dear friend, I must 
confess my penchants to you,” she said. “I reek vice, and as reports 
agree that you have a very philosophical understanding, I have 
come in the hopes you will set my conscience at ease.” 

“Speak, my love,’ I hastened to reply, “what are the sins 
you cherish the most? In which ones do you indulge with the 
greatest pleasure?” 


Juliette @ 1089 


“Theft. Nothing amuses me like stealing others’ property; 
and although I have better than one hundred thousand livres a 
year, not a single day of my life goes by but I steal for enjoyment’s 
sake.” 

“Console yourself, my darling,” said I, taking my friend’s 
hand in mine, ‘“‘and in her whom you love behold one of that 
passion’s greatest zealots. Like you, I cannot dispense with steal- 
ing, and as do you, I derive pleasure from it—pleasure! why, I too 
have made of thievery one of my most precious pastimes. Stealing, 
my dear, is a natural institution; not only is it not an evil, but, 
manifestly, it must be classified as good. 

“Let me add, dearest friend,” I went on, embracing Zanetti 
with fervor, ‘‘that I am gladdened to perceive that your principles 
are untainted by any residue of moral scruple.” 

‘Upon all those questions nobody could be firmer than I,” 
the amiable Venetian declared. ‘Led by my mind into imagining a 
thousand infamies, there is nothing I deny myself when my passions 
speak.” 

“Goodness!” said I, “‘are you capable even of murder?” 

“Even of parricide; even of the most frightful crime possible, 
if ’twere possible to say that for us humans crime does rightly 
exist.” 

“Ah, by God,” I said to my friend, “kiss her and kiss her a 
thousand times over, the woman who resembles you so perfectly, 
and deem me worthy of you.” 

“Since you are so open with me,” said Zanetti, “I shall not be 
less so with you; listen, and shudder not at what I have to confide. 
And swear to me you shall never divulge to anyone the things you 
are about to hear.” 

I vowed silence; and then my friend began to speak. 

“You know, Juliette, that I am a widow, and therefore ac- 
countable to no one-for the way in which I choose to conduct my 
life. Refrain from asking me how I won my freedom .. . and, 
rather than forcing me to a confession, guess that it is the reward 
of crime.” 

‘Was it committed by your own hand?” 

‘‘No. That miserable foe of my pleasures fell to an assassin; 
in Venice it is easy, with a few sequins, to sever any tie.” 


1090 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“It might have been better to have done the thing yourself. In 
any case, that would have established between us one more point 
in common.” 

‘Dear soul! How I adore you! And what a praiseworthy 
thing one does when one liberates oneself from those rogues when 
they contrive to become troublesome ; by what right do they pre- 
sume to curb our freedorn? Let them grant us divorce and husband- 
murder will be a little less rampant. 

‘“‘At any rate, you must know that in Venice there exists a 
notorious association of villains devoted uniquely to robbing, to 
swindling, to blackmailing and, when the need arises, to killing 
anybody who resists them. This association’s members and cor- 
respondents are many, its influence extends for thirty or forty 
miles round about; and its headquarters are at the house of a 
certain Moberti, director of the organization. 

‘‘Now, this Moberti is my lover; I am mad about him: no 
one has such sentiments for a man as I have for him. And yet, my 
dove, when you see him you shall perhaps wonder at my passion 
for him; however, so soon as you come to know him your surprise 
will evaporate, and you will realize that it is possible to love a 
man for his tastes, his passions, his temper and cast of mind rather 
than for the physical amenities of his person. 

‘“Moberti is fifty-four; he is as red-haired as Judas; his eyes 
are rheumy and small, set near together; his mouth is wide and 
ill-furnished with teeth; ‘11s nose and lips negroid; he is short, squat, 
misshapen, but endowed, in spite of all that, with an instrument so 
prodigious that, notwithstanding my extreme habit of sodomy, he 
scorches me, he fairly splits me every time he embuggers me. . 
and he never takes his pleasure with me otherwise than in that 
manner. That, dear Juliette, is the description of the man I wor- 
ship, although I put horns of cuckoldry on his head a hundred times 
every day; but to my trvancies he raises no objection; he realizes I 
cannot forego them; ancl if, on my side, I tolerate unfaithfulness in 
him, even providing him with the game he is fondest of, he on his 
side allows me to fuck with whom and as often as I wish. No 
jealousy on either side: it is almost what one might call a spiritual 
union. 

‘“‘Moberti has the k:ind of mind I admire; his is a disorder of 


Juliette 2 1091 


the imagination so original, a ferocity so rarefied, an abandon of 
principle so prodigious, an atheism so profound, a corruption so 
complete, that all these qualities put my brain in a ferment, and 
upon their account I adore that man: the like of it is not to be 
found in any of the descriptions of love penned by your poets and 
your historians down to this day. 

‘“‘As you must imagine, Moberti has several agents in Venice, 
whom he places amidst the very rich, and who, in constant contact 
with the members of this caste, are in a position to provide him 
with intelligence. I am the foremost of those agents, I gather and 
sift information supplied by the others, and it is through me the 
principal thefts are planned. Our affair began but three years ago, I 
have been serving him for only that long, but I can assert that in 
this short space I have brought him into more than ten millions 
and I have had him assassinate at least four hundred people; and 
that is what swells my head. I discharge for three days and three 
nights running, my dear, each time I commit or am instrumental to 
the committing of crimes of this sort. He himself loves murder to 
the point where, like that famous Siberian robber, he will, during 
an expedition, appoint his comrades to carry off the loot in order 
to have his own hands free to cut the victims’ throats. He is, I 
insist, the cruelest and the most barbarous scoundrel alive today; 
and it is the wonderful concordance of his vices with those of my 
character that makes for my devotion to him. 

‘‘As if to prove that the criminal destiny is always far happier 
than the virtuous, provided it be incorrigible and bold, fate has 
been kind to my lover, who for twenty-five years has been leading 
a uniformly wicked existence; until now he has not even come under 
suspicion. Several of his lieutenants have been wheeled, hanged, 
burned at the stake, but none of them has ever compromised him. 
This man, rare through courage, rare through perversity, looks 
forward to another twelve or fifteen active years before we retire, 
he and I, in Dalmatia, where he has lately bought some superb 
estates. "Tis thus we intend to crown our lives, as evil as any that 
have left their blot in human annals. 

“That, my dear, is what I had to tell you; decide whether 
you would like to throw in your lot with us. If you accept, I shall 
shortly issue you an invitation to join my lover and me at dinner; 


1092 <% ‘THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


you will see him take his pleasure with me; with you too, if you 
desire; and we shall then all three confer upon arrangements for 
an intimate relationship.” 

“Be sure of it,” I answered, “you could make me no more 
agreeable proposal. I accept—accept everything—but upon two 
conditions: the first being, that if your lover cares to amuse himself 
with me, he shall pay my price, and I would add that, likewise, I 
shall only collaborate in his thefts provided I be given a substantial 
share of the proceeds. The second condition is that from this 
moment forward we share all expenses incurred in connection with 
our libertine exercises: it is your friend I wish to be, and not your 
whore anymore.” 

That conversation was followed by a delicious supper, and we | 
took leave of each other with promises to meet again before long. 

Not knowing how this friendship might develop, I thought 
best, until such time as matters became clearer, to say nothing 
about it to my companion. Besides, our relations, though close, 
allowed both of us a margin of freedom broad enough to enable us 
each to do whatever eack. wished independently of the other. 

A few days later Signora Zanetti advised me that she had 
been in touch with her friend; that the latter was exceedingly eager 
to become acquainted with me; and that she therefore hoped for 
my company.at dinner the next day. They would be expecting me at 
a charming house Moberti possessed on the island of San Giorgio, 
a few minutes by boat from the city. 

What I had been told touching that extraordinary man’s 
looks proved accurate: it would be impossible to be uglier than he, 
and difficult, at the same time, to have a more alert and crafty face. 

‘Here she is,” said Zanetti, embracing him, “the pretty girl 
I told you about; I trust: you will find her satisfactory in every 
respect.” 

The brigand then took me by the hand and, without a word, 
led me into an adjoining chamber, already occupied, I was rather 
surprised to discover, by :wo boys, fifteen years of age and of ex- 
treme beauty. 

“Do not allow yourself to be scandalized,” said the lewd 
little man, “I am a bugger. Notwithstanding, I shall fuck you; in 
the ass, be it understood. Show that part to me, but have the 


Julictte & 1093 


kind consideration to keep your cunt well out of my sight: enable 
me to suppose that you are completely devoid of one.” 

This opening struck me as rude. What it was that was attrac- 
tive about this person I cannot say; but from the very first I sensed 
that such a man was someone to be loved automatically. Moberti 
was long peering at my behind, no detail escaped his attention; 
then, giving two forceful slaps to each of my buttocks, “Good,” he 
pronounced, “it will do, you may take off your clothes.” 

“And your friend, Signor ?” 

“She will come; well she knows that nothing will be begun 
without her.” 

And while I was undressing, Moberti caressed the two 
adolescents. 

The beautiful Venetian appeared. 

“You have provided for everything ?” her lover inquired. “We 
are in no danger of being disturbed ? All the doors are locked? The 
dinner will be good?” 

“Rely upon me. You know that I never neglect anything.” 

“Then let us fuck in peace,” Moberti rejoined, “and sur- 
render to the curious caprices imagination engenders.” 

“Nothing stands in your way, my friend; you are screened 
from every gaze save that of God.” 

“Peugh, I worry very little about that witness,” the roué 
declared, “I am only sorry that no God really exists, sorry, that is, 
to be deprived of the pleasure of insulting him more positively. But 
can we speak in this young woman’s presence? Is she of our breed ?” 

“Indeed she is, you remember what I told you about her. She 
merely waits to be assigned to her task, and I dare predict her 
performance will please you.” 

“I am already pleased with her ass—as pleased, that is to 
say, as one can be with a female ass. Come, my dear, ready all 
the implements.” 

Promptly unbuttoning the two boys’ breeches, Zanetti ex- 
posed their behinds to the libertine, who, reclining upon a broad 
sofa, frigged himself while examining them. 

“Hurry,” my friend whispered to me, “I am sure that he is 
burning to see your ass next to those other ones.” 

My bush well camouflaged, I quickly take my place beside the 


1094 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


boys, and Moberti subjects the three of us to a moment of impartial 
scrutiny. However, he kisses mine with an unmistakable ardor, 
tongues it deeply; he then orders one of his bardashes to get be- 
tween my legs and pluck out some of my pubic hair, so that I am 
soon jerking and twitching about, and he goes on thrusting his 
tongue into my anus, and his mistress frigs him while she is herself 
frigged by the other bardash. 

“Now heed me well,” the brigand finally says, ‘‘and, above 
all, contrive to carry out my instructions to the letter. You are to 
loose a fart into my mouth at the very instant the boy pulls out one 
of your hairs, and when Le pulls out the sixth, just as you fart, you 
are also to piss upon his face, and to cover him with invectives 
also.” 

I have the good fortune to succeed in complying with this 
unusual prescription, and with all the punctuality the libertine re- 
quests; and when I get to the inundation and when he hears it 
being accompanied by hard words addressed to the object of his 
lust, he snatches up a bundle of switches and thrashes me for a 
whole quarter of an hour. 

‘What are you doing? What in the world are you doing?” 
Zanetti cries, pursuant to the role she is playing on the edge of this 
scene. ‘‘What wrong has this creature done to you?” 

“She farted, the nasty thing; more, she pissed her wretched 
urine all over my Ganymede, and sullied his delicious features; 
that’s what she did, and for such outrages no punishments can be 
severe enough.” 

“Well then, rascal,” Zanetti replies, learned in the fine science 
of ensuring her lover’s pleasure, “I am going to whip you until you 
stop treating my friend in this way.” 

Thereupon a sound thrashing is administered to him, and 
after fifteen minutes of this the Italian exhibits a member that has 
filled out to a foot in length and a circumference of eight inches. 

‘‘Have you ever bekeld another of this size?” he asks, bring- 
ing it near. 

“Heaven!” [ exclaim, “I am doomed if ever you perforate 
me with such a device!” 

“Yet that is what is about to happen to you,” says he, next 
ordering his mistress to undress also; “you will not be more dis- 


’

comforted than these children, they have virginal parts, you do 
not.” 

“But whatever befalls them, I have no wish to die.” 

At this point our colloquy is interrupted as Zanetti, naked, 
presents her hindquarters to him for kissing; and while one of 
the boys pulls a hair from her cunt, she fires a perfectly enormous 
fart point-blank at her lover’s nose, who swears, storms, hurls him- 
self upon her, and embuggers her straightway. He has distributed 
the little boys and myself so cunningly that during this operation 
our three asses, clustered about his goddess’ flanks, are all near 
enough to his face for his indiscriminate kissing. 

I was amazed, I confess, at the manner in which Zanetti stood 
up to that gigantic member’s incursion into her fundament; the slut 
never flinched; roaring oaths, the Italian was lunging backward 
and forward and snapping his teeth at our buttocks the whole time. 
He withdraws, the group dissolves, and he considers us, cruel lust 
glittering in his eyes; he lies down upon the sofa, his face buried 
between his mistress’ buttocks, whose anus he suckles, and from’ 
there he orders us to come one by one and frig him briefly, taking 
good care to kiss his device, to lick his testicles, and to insert three 
fingers into his ass. 

So extreme is the effect upon his member of this byplay that 
I am convinced he must be at the point of discharging; but no, his 
self-possession unimpaired, he contains himself, rises, calls for 
switches, and belabors the four of us with might and main: we each 
receive two hundred cuts at least. This operation over with, he 
seizes me, and in his glance I read trouble. 

‘“Buggeress,” he announces, “I am of a mind to kill you.” 

Accustomed as I was to all such scenes, fear nevertheless took 
hold of me, and it was not lessened by what I seemed to detect in 
Zanetti’s stare. 

‘Yes, damn your thrice-fucked heart,” the Italian continued, 
“yes, foul slut that you are, my urge is to kill you.” 

And as he spoke he squeezed my throat as if he were going 
to throttle me; next, he catches up a dagger, poises it over my 
breast while he is frigged by his mistress who pays no attention 
to me, who makes no gesture to reassure me. After keeping me 
several minutes in dreadful suspense, he bends me over the sofa, 


1096 .! THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


presents his prick at the entrance of my ass and drives it, without 
warning or preamble, so forcefully in that cold sweat bathes my 
face and I am on the verge of swooning. In the meantime, my 
friend was holding me fast, forestalling all the movements I might 
otherwise have made, so that I was ploughed, harrowed, cloven by 
that monstrous machine without being able to put up the slightest 
defense. While this went forward, Moberti was, with each hand, 
fondling the hinder parts of a bardash and kissing Zanetti upon 
the mouth. 

A few moments of this and he ordered me, who had been 
resting my hands on the edge of the sofa, to place them on the 
floor instead, and to raise my rump as high as I could, and to arch 
my neck, bending my head as far back as possible; one of the little 
boys, straddling my neck, stood facing him, and Moberti tongued 
his mouth for a time; then the other bardash replaced the first, 
and his mouth was tongued in its turn; and Zanetti, striking a 
different attitude, came up to place her asshole where her lover had 
found nought but mouths iin instant before. Discharge he did not, 
and withdrawing his prick suddenly and without precaution, he 
occasioned me almost as rauch pain by this precipitate retreat as 
when he had fought his wzy into the premises. 

‘Her ass is good,” he remarked when he had emerged from 
it, “it grips and it is hot; tut she wiggles while being embuggered, 
and you know, Zanetti, I cannot tolerate unsteadiness, it’s either 
absolute stillness or I don’t discharge.” 

His mistress then Hogs him a little with the switches; I was 
lying down upon the floor, the two acolytes were frigging his 
member against my behind. 

Next, I am told to get up and stretch out flat upon the sofa; 
he has the children climb upon my body and range their asses side 
by side and adjacent to mine; he approaches his prick to a juvenile 
vent; advances; meets with stoutest resistance. 

“Then tie the little bastards!” shouts the rake. 

And I complying with Zanetti’s request for aid, we bind and 
garrote the youngster, having rolled him into a ball, so that his 
head, thrust down between his legs, provides Moberti with a 
mouth to fuck as well as an ass; and to ensure that he will not 
budge out of position, Zanetti squats upon the child. Moberti comes 


Juliette 2% 1097 


up to the gate again, all possibilities of disturbance having now 
been removed. Three determined heaves and the colossal prick 
disappears into the anus of the puny little fellow; I frig the liber- 
tine’s ass in the meantime, and he handles the other bardash. 

During that voluptuous act the villain said dreadful things. 
He raved uninterruptedly about crimes, about abominations, about 
murders, about wanton destructions, about massacres. And for all 
that he still did not discharge. The second bardash was immediately 
trussed in the same position; Moberti enjoyed him in the same 
fashion, but, this time, he had hung the first, the boy already fucked, 
upside down and alongside his mistress, who, as hitherto, was 
squatting upon the bardash being embuggered; thanks to which 
arrangement, he had an ass, a cunt, and a mouth within reach of 
his lips. I was flogging him. His utterances became more horrible 
still, and the next instant I saw blood flowing in rivulets upon the 
floor: the cruel one, upon unleashing his seed, had stabbed a 
stiletto twenty times into both the boy he was sodomizing and the 
other dangling before him. 

“Villain!” I exclaimed, redoubling the blows I was bestowing 
upon his behind, “that is a signal piece of treachery you have just 
performed, and you may flatter yourself that you are a monster.” 

His discharge had been awesome, more like a volcanic 
eruption than anything else; his comportment was that of a wild 
animal rather than a human being. 

Calm once re-established, the two corpses were dropped into 
a hole already dug in the little garden attached to the chamber 
where this scene had just transpired; the three survivors then 
dressed and readjusted themselves. Moberti fell asleep before it 
was time for dinner. 

“Yes, he is indeed an unusual man,” I complimented his 
mistress. : 

‘You have not seen anything yet,” Zanetti replied; “his be- 
havior has been mild today, it is sometimes considerably worse.” 

Two other victims were there: he would come to grips with 
them after the midday meal. 

“And as they are girls, I can assure you that he will cause 
them ten times more suffering.” 

“Am I to take it that he finds our sex the more moving?” 


1098 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Of course. With people who are cruel in their pleasures it’s 
always the same story: the weakness, the frailty, the delicacy of a 
woman irritates them far more powerfully, their ferocity has far 
greater effect when pitted against helplessness than against strength; 
the more defenseless the object, the more violently they attack it, 
and as this introduces a greater portion of villainy into the deed, 
the enjoyment it affords 's increased commensurately. Did he really 
hurt you ?” 

“He nigh maimed me. I have confronted grandiose pricks in 
my day; never did one cause me so much pain.” 

Moberti awoke very shortly; scarcely had he opened his eyes 
when he called for food; dinner was served. We were in a cool, 
secluded room; everything required for the service lay ready and 
accessible, dispensing us from any need of domestics. It was while 
we were at table the brigand specified the tasks he meant to entrust 
to me within the framework of his criminal organization: I was 
to act as a cover for his thefts; I was to seek out victims for him; 
taking leave of Durand, I was to install myself in a house, alone, 
to which I would lure dupes whom he aimed to rob and kill. I 
immediately saw that were I to enter into this association, infinitely 
more danger than profit would accrue to me; and able, in my posi- 
tion, to disdain such mediocre earnings, I inwardly rejected this 
man’s proposals. But I was only too careful to conceal my true 
thoughts, and in order that nothing upset his illusion, I applauded 
his scheme warmly and promised to lend myself to it. Thus did we 
conclude the most magnificent repast I had enjoyed in a long time; 
when we stood up from table, Moberti drew me into a small 
chamber. 

“Juliette,” he said to me once he had closed the door and 
we were alone, “you have observed my tastes from sufficiently 
near on to have realized that I situate my major delights in mur- 
der. Can I be sure of the zeal with which you are going to under- 
take to multiply my victims? Have.I no weakness, no remorse, 
to fear in you?” 

“Try me, my dear, there is no other way for you to allay your 
doubts,” I replied; ‘‘my conduct will tell you whether it is through 
enthusiasm or through a more passive complacency that I am aiding 
you to attain your ends.” 


Juliette * 1099 


And at this point the most perfidious idea arose in my wicked 
imagination. I had no wish to become that man’s mistress, none to 
accept his offers of partnership, and yet, simply on evil principle, 
I feigned jealousy. 

“Only upon one score do I have any reservations,” I declared. 
“To play second fiddle in your schemes is not much to my liking. 
Trust, affection, those treasures so worth possessing when they 
are bestowed by a person one loves, will any of that be mine? 
have agreed to everything you proposed, true; but I should much 
prefer to be the only one to exercise this employment, and not to 
have, perpetually before my eyes, a rival as dangerous as your 
Zanetti... .” 

And the knave listened to me with equal amounts of surprise 
and interest. 

After a moment of silence he asked me a question: “You 
would actually be in love with me ?”’ 

‘“‘Ah, I would be crazy about a man whose tastes are in every 
point identical to mine.” 

“Excellent; not another word, everything will be arranged. 
You are infinitely more beautiful than Zanetti, I prefer you, and 
you are going to enjoy undisputed sway over my heart.” 

“But she will be in despair when she discovers this! As well, 
shall I not be making the very worst enemy for myself? Do you 
think she will ever be able to forgive me for having seduced you?” 

‘‘Oh, were she to bother us seriously—”’ 

“My God, what an idea! I tremble .. . a woman I am devoted 
to, a woman whom you once loved . . . have you given sufficient 
thought to this crowning act of horror?” 

“Horror? No such thing exists, all our acts are simply what 
they are, all are inspired by Nature: those are elementary precepts, 
and I wonder that you are still at the stage of doubting them.” 

“Ah, my scruples are certain to give way ere long before the 
charms of having you all to myself... . But I tell you now that so 
long as that creature breathes I shall be uneasy: on the one hand, 
I shall live in fear of her, and on the other I shall dread losing you. 
It seems to me that while we are on the subject it would be best 
to settle it right away. That woman is mischievous; if you but 
knew all the things she told me about you. . . . Ah, believe me, 


1100 <Q THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


if we do not take the necessary preventive measures she will never 
allow us one instant of peace.” 

“I adore you, heavenly girl,” said the Italian, folding me 
in his arms, “your rival’s fate is decided, you triumph, nothing now 
remains but to consult together upon the manner in which she is 
to die.” 

And, just as aroused by this idea as I, Moberti catches hold 
of my ass and flings into it without the slightest preliminary; 
that gigantean prick might have wrung shrieks from me upon 
some other occasion, but, in a fiery mood myself, instead of wilting 
before the dart I lunged at it, and discharged the moment Moberti’s 
balls danced against my buttocks. 

“What shall we do to her?” the rake demanded while he 
fucked away. “It must be as we are in the midst of pleasures that 
we decree her sufferings.” 

We did so; and the scene that is about to be described to you 
was the result of our de.iberatigns. We went back into the other 
room. 

Moberti, eager to be at the peak of his strength, had taken 
care not to squander any of it in my entrails. Zanetti had been 
worried by our lengthy absence, and upon our return her eyes 
plainly announced that the demon of jealousy had begun to torment 
her heart. She suggested that we all remove into the room where 
the morning’s orgies had been celebrated; and there she presented 
to her lover the new objects intended for the pleasures which 
were to close the afternoon. Awaiting us were a twenty-six-year-old 
mother, seven months pregnant, and two charming little girls, one 
of eleven, the other of nine, whom she held by the hand. Moberti, 
already familiar with the merchandise, having himself negotiated 
for it, was thrilled to have it in his clutches at last. 

“This,” he whispered to me gleefully, “is going to bring me 
an atrocious erection. Tat woman has been induced into error: 
she fancies I am going to render her some great services, but the 
tortures I have in store for her are hideous. Well, Zanetti, let us 
have the doors locked once again, let silence reign, let there be no 
noise in this house whatever, save that which I am about to make. 
I would like to have the entire earth stand still when I lift my 
prick.” 


Juliette ® 1101 


Moberti sits down, he bids his mistress undress Angelica 
while Mirza, the elder of the girls, and little Marietta are told to 
wait in respectful silence until the brigand issues his instructions 
to them. 

Zanetti, scrupulously veiling all of Angelica’s anterior parts, 
fetches the woman’s rump up to Moberti who, after handling it 
rudely, declares that before the hour is out there shall be changes 
wrought in the shape of this handsome ass. He pokes and prods 
the replete belly, pinches it lustily, and predicts trouble for it as 
well. 

‘‘Ah, Signor!” says the interesting Angelica, “you have cruelly 
deceived me; it is now but too plain what horrors lie ahead for me; 
at least respect the child I bear in my womb... .” 

’Tis with gales of laughter the villain greets this speech. 

“Double-dyed whore,” he cries, raining blows upon the un- 
lucky soul, “‘oh, indeed, indeed! rest assured, I hold your state in 
the very highest consideration; nothing, in my view, is more entitled 
to respect than a gravid female, and you must already sense the 
extent to which I am touched by your fascinating condition. Begin, 
nevertheless, by undressing your elder daughter for me, and bring 
her over here in the same way Zanetti has just presented you for 
my inspection.” 

All this time kneeling between the libertine’s legs, I was 
polluting him gently to keep his fire lighted, and he bestowed 
frequent kisses upon my lips. Nothing so pretty as the little girl 
who is led up to him, and nothing so cruel as the species of lewd 
caresses wherewith he overwhelms the tender thing. The younger 
child advances; she is dealt similar treatment. 

“Damn my eyes!” the exalted villain protests. ““What a furious 
shame I haven’t the means to embugger the three of them at the 
same stroke.” 

So saying, he takes the mother firmly in hand, lays her upon 
her back, lifts her Jegs straight in the air and with cords secures 
them thus, then bum-fucks her. Following his request, I leap upon 
Angelica and assume a position which places my ass. within reach 
of the libertine’s kisses; and upon my flanks his mistress establishes 
herself, presenting a second set of hindquarters to the insatiable 
one’s caresses; with each of his hands he has at a child, whose 


1102 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


buttocks he worries with tongs. Not content to molest those two 
little behinds, he begins to pluck at the mother’s with the same 
instruments; as for ours, he confines himself to gnawing them while 
we expel farts into his mouth. 

“Press down with your knees upon this worthless rascal, 
Juliette,” said he, ‘“‘see whether you cannot, through your combined 
weight, crush the nasty fruit stinking in her entrails.” 

Zanetti and I bestir ourselves, and there and then come near 
to squeezing the life out of poor Angelica. After fifteen minutes 
of reaming the anus of the sorely beset woman, who uttered 
piercing screams throughout this abominable torture, Moberti dis- 
embuggered and called for the elder of the two girls, Mirza. 
Zanetti opened up the way, and I presented the instrument, grown 
more terrible still from its incursions into the mother’s ass. At the 
price of much struggling we finally succeeded, the Venetian and I, 
in inserting that enormous mass into the narrow orifice offered to 
its furies. As soon as Moberti notices that some progress has been 
made, he bolts forward with such vigor that he soon sheathes his 
weapon to the hilt; but the unhappy patient faints. 

“That is what I was after,” our ferocious personage explains, 
“I never begin to enjoy myself until my vexations have reduced 
them to insensibility. Ha, Zanetti! Do you hear what I am saying ?” 
Then, to me, under his breath: ‘‘When I send her to hell, I want 
her to arrive there blackened by a crime of the very first magni- 
tude.” 

Directed by the Venetian, Angelica clambers upon the back 
of her unconscious daughter, so that both their behinds are facing 
the rake; my buttocks are: exposed to the right, those of the younger 
daughter to the left, and my friend kneels before her lover’s ass; 
but will you ever guess with what episode the libertine now regaled 
his lubricity ? Biting his buttocks fiercely, his mistress had to imitate 
the growlings of a bulldog, while he, simulating the same animal, 
worried Angelica’s ass. I never saw anything so droll as this concert 
of canines; I must say, however, that it was far less amusing for 
Angelica, whose buttocks, torn by the cruel brigand, were soon 
hanging in tatters down her thighs. He also gave a little attention, 
now and then, to mine and to the little girl’s, but that was only 


Juliette <2 1103 


to sharpen his teeth, which, with renewed fury, he would redirect 
against Angelica’s posterior flesh, soon reduced to such a state 
of ruination that, like her daughter, she collapsed. Moberti changes 
asses; the other sister is stoutly attacked, and tis now upon the 
buttocks of the one latterly fucked that he directs his fangs. 

In the meantime, Signora Zanetti is executing the orders she 
receives. While her lover is fucking, she, to promote his ecstasy, 
stabs the child he is gazing at, and the little creature falls dead, 
swimming in a pool of blood. 

“Scoundrel,” exclaims the Italian, “see what a frightful deed 
you have just committed; may the Eternal, by whose grace you 
shall live yet a while, grant you time to repent what you have done, 
for hell would be your share were you to die laden with such a 
crime. .. . Leave the corpse where it is, I shall be wanting it in 
a while.” 

These accumulated horrors have had their effect upon him, 
he withdraws now, having exhaled whole floods of sperm; this 
operation over with, he leaves Zanetti to keep the unhappy family 
company and retires with me into the room where we had held our 
consultation a short time before. 

“I am going to perpetrate atrocities,” Moberti declares, kiss- 
ing me feelingly upon the mouth and brightening’ his member 
against my behind, ‘“‘and your rival shall be enveloped in them. 
Would that I were able to devise something worse than what we 
have decided her fate is to be, would that there were some more 
terrible torture than the one she is to undergo; but limits there 
must be, and I grieve. None the less—ah, Juliette, I restiffen !— 
observe this treacherous idea’s influence upon my senses. What a 
superb ass,” he continues, fondling my buttocks, “I adore you, 
Juliette, you are full of imagination, in crime you possess inventive- 
ness, in performing it facility, and if I am immolating Zanetti 
tis because I want you with me forever.” 

“But, kind friend,” I interject, ‘do you not. forget that this 
woman idolizes you? I yielded to your perfidious desires in a 
moment of weakness; I reproach myself for it. Thus to treat a 
woman who is so attached to us—” 

‘What the whore’s sentiments happen to be is to me of no 


1104 @ THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


importance; it’s my passions that are sacred, my erection that 
counts. Ha, the slut! She suspects nothing, this is the occasion to 
turn upon her. I foresee a delightful evening. 

“Here,” he went on, “clad me in this tiger’s skin. They shall 
be all three of them naked next door, grouped around the corpse: 
I shall attack them indiscriminately, I shall eat them alive; and 
my feelings for Signora Zanetti, you shall soon see what they 
are when I have my teeth in her and her mortal woes have begun. 
Do not fail to exhort mz to extreme rigor during the scene. After 
that we shall terminate in the way we have planned; and if in the 
meantime anything more revolting occurs to you, you will include 
it among our resolutions; for, as now they stand, they are far from 
measuring up to my desires.” 

I entered and gave instructions to Zanetti. She was startled 
to be told to join the ranks of the others. Accustomed to command- 
ing, she found subordination strange, and, not a little bewildered, 
she could not prevent herself from questioning me. 

“What is he going to do?” 

“You shall see,” was my chilly reply. And I went back to 
Moberti. 

I found him masturbating, inspired by the execrations in the 
offing; catching sight of me, he heads toward my ass, submerges 
it beneath caresses: bending me forward, the mischievous fellow 
slides his stave into me, swearing that in all the world there is 
nothing that affords such pleasure as my behind. He sawed away 
for quite some time, during which we exchanged thoughts upon 
the forthcoming tortures, improved upon them, conceived horrors. 
at which even the most savage animals would have shuddered. 

“That should do,” said the rake, withdrawing, “I feel suff- 
ciently aroused.” And, dressed in his tiger’s skin, its four paws 
armed with monstrous talons, and its muzzle so arranged as to 
permit the wearer to bite anything within reach; thus disguised, 
I say, and with me following in his train, naked, and wielding a 
huge cudgel for use in the event he showed signs of laggardliness, 
we made our entrance. 

Zanetti is the first upon whom he leaps, with a blow of his 
claws he carries one of her breasts away, and sinks his teeth so 
deep into a buttock that blood gushes forth at once. 


Juliette %& 110% 


“My God!” cries that unfortunate, “I am lost, Juliette, and 
tis you who have undone me! Ah, I ought to have known—what . 
lies in store for me now? This monster, whom I loved so dearly, 
what horrors has he prepared for me?” 

And each of her lamentations was answered by fearful abuse. 
Moberti, however, gave his victim a minute’s breathing space while 
he assailed the other objects surrounding her. Angelica and her 
daughter attempt to flee; but what escape is there from this fury? 
The libertine contemplates them; but there is another target he 
wishes to have at first: the corpse preoccupies him, he fastens upon 
it, his carnivorous fang ravens for a moment upon the poor crea- 
ture’s inert remains, which he then abandons to pursue the two 
living objects cowering in a corner. He overtakes them both, 
martyrizes them with the same unabated fury; and it 1s precisely 
upon their fleshier parts the villain is happiest to batten. His prick 
is at an extraordinary stand. I am obliged to chase after him, 
sometimes thwacking him with all my strength, sometimes to frig 
him from underneath or to suck his behind: an operation I ac- 
complish by raising the tail of the tiger’s skin. 

His cruelties move gradually in the direction of refinement. 
He traps his mistress and signals to me as he leaps upon her; I aid 
him; we tie the wretch hand and foot, secure her to a wooden bench. 
He crouches upon her and with his sharp claws scratches out her 
eyes, tears off her nose, her cheeks: and he was kissing her, the 
brute, while she screamed; and I was frigging him as hard as I 
could. 

“But for me,” I was saying to myself, ‘‘but for my treacheries, 
my perfidies, my counsels, he would never have undertaken this 
horror: I am its sole cause.” That delicious thought cost me a 
spasm; and he, pursuing his abaminations, continued to kiss the 
doomed woman’s lips so as, said he, to lose not one of the precious 
gasps of the agony racking a mistress he had cherished! He turns 
her over, lacerates her behind, and has me pour molten wax into 
the wounds; at last, gone quite berserk, he pushes me aside and, 
while I frig him, the monster tears, assassinates, rips to shreds 
the woebegone object of his erstwhile passion, whom he finally 
leaves lifeless upon the floor. 

Drunk from rage and lust, he turns upon the other two 


1106 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


victims. With his claws alone he snatches the child out of the 
mother’s womb, smashes it against that poor woman’s head, hurls 
himself upon the surviving girl, chokes, rends, massacres them 
both. Thereupon he speeds like an arrow into my ass, ’tis there the 
maniac, along with his fuck, rids himself of the murdering fever 
which has reduced him to the level of Nature’s most dangerous 
animals... . 

And we speed back to Venice, promising to meet again at 
the earliest opportunity in order to settle the final details of the 
association into which, from the first, I had no desire whatever to 
enter. 

I spent a sleepless n.ght. Ah, ye gods! how I tossed and turned 
in my women’s arms as they frigged me and as I dwelt upon the 
crimes wherewith I had just soiled myself. It was then I realized 
that among the pleasures life offers us, none is so violent as that 
of murder; and that once this passion has stolen its way into the 
heart, there is no possibl dislodging it. Nothing, no, nothing bears 
comparison with the thirst for blood. Only taste it, and thenceforth, 
insatiable, you exist solely through the destruction of victims. 

However, not for all the world would I have fallen in with 
’ that man’s proposals: in them, as I have already told you, I saw 
risks infinitely outweighing profits; firmly resolved to refuse, I 
related everything to Durand, who assured me that my decision 
was wisely taken, since Moberti would undoubtedly cease to treat 
me as his mistress before three months were out. When he called 
I had the door shut in his face, and I never saw him again. 

Durand one day besought me to come to her apartments, she 
had a woman there who ardently desired me; for the attraction I 
exerted, outrageously if you like, but naturally withal, was stronger 
upon women than upon men. Signora Zatta, wife of a magistrate, 
perhaps fifty years of ag:2, was yet in possession of her beauty and 
endowed as well with a furious fondness for women. No sooner 
does she clap eyes upon me than the tribade sets to cajoling me as 
would a man, and her solicitations become such that she deprives 
me, as it were, of all means to resist her. 

We sup together, and when dessert arrives, the Messalina, 
half-drunk, flings herself upon me and takes off my clothes. Zatta 
was one of those idiosyncratic women who, full of clever and 


Juliette % 1107 


original ideas, are drawn to their own sex not so much out of 
taste as through libertinage, and whose behavior with it proceeds 
less from the quest for real pleasures than from a wish to indulge 
lascivious caprices. This creature had nothing but masculine tend- 
encies: I discharged six times beneath her cunning fingers, or rather 
"twas but a single ejaculation which lasted for two long hours. Once 
returned to my senses, I thought to criticize her preliminary tactics, 
which I held bizarre; but I found her as apt in their defense as she 
was adroit in performing them. She proved to me that the aberra- 
tion she delighted in was for her more enjoyable than any other; 
she added that she carried her manias to their logical conclusion, 
and that she never discharged more agreeably than when sur- 
rendering to them. 

She desired other girls; seven responded to the call; after 
having frigged herself with all of them, from her pocket she 
produced a dildo the likes of which I had never before set eyes 
upon. That singular instrument had four stems. Signora Zatta 
began by burying one of them in her ass and sodomizing me with a 
second. We were back to back: the two remaining stems were 
curved upward in a half-circle: these we buried in our cunts. In 
this position, we each had a girl between our legs, who sucked our 
clitoris and who maneuvered the machine with artistry. Employ- 
ment had to be found for the five others. Two were hence assigned 
to flog those who were sucking us; two more, perched upon chairs, 
gave us their cunts to drink from; and the last supervised all the 
others, moving about the ranks and seeing to it that everything 
was accomplished in strict accordance with prescription. Zatta and 
I fought together against the pack, and after having exhausted all 
our seven women, having had our buttocks lashed raw, she pro- 
claimed her intention of avenging herself upon our whippers. We 
flogged them unmercifully; they complained, they screamed, ’twas 
in vain, we were inflexible, and no quarter was granted until floods 
of fuck had appeased our fury. The indefatigable rascal, aroused 
rather than calmed by this series of lewd episodes, insisted that we 
spend the night together, and it was dedicated to a thousand 
imaginative impudicities, each one more voluptuous and more 
unusual than the last. That libertine’s greatest skill was probably in 
the licking of the asshole. She could so lengthen and stiffen her 


1108 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


tongue that the longest and most agile finger would not have 
procured sweeter sensations. 

That day’s requirernent of supplementary women led Durand 
to yield upon a point I had been pressing for quite some time. We 
added four charming creatures to our household, and retained, out- 
side, more than five undred others, ready at any hour of the night 
and day. 

The excesses of turpitude we witnessed in our house, excesses 
committed by individua.s of both sexes, were frequent and out- 
standing. Experienced though I was, I continued to learn, and I 
avow that I would never have supposed the human imagination 
could soar to such incredible heights of corruption and pervegsity. 
What I saw achieved there defies belief; ’tis a vast, an endless 
abyss of horrors and infamies into which libertinage is able to 
drive the human being. How dangerous he is when aroused! No, 
I may truthfully say so, the most ferocious and the most savage 
beasts never attain such monstrosities. The influence we enjoyed, 
the silence, the orderliness, the subordination which reigned in 
that asylum, the extreme ease with which the visitor availed him- 
self of the means to undertake every variety of imaginable and 
unimaginable debauch; everything encouraged the shy man, every- 
thing quickened the enterprising man’s enthusiasm; and passions, 
no matter what form in which they might present themselves, in 
no matter what kind of brain they might waken, were always sure 
to be fed, to be favored, and to be satisfied with us. 

It is there, my friends, I have said it before, I proclaim it 
again, yes, if one wishes to understand men, it is there one must 
follow his behavior: it is in his hour of lubricity, in his lubricious 
expressions that his character, laid absolutely bare, yields itself, 
in all its truest colors, to the appreciations of the philosophic. stu- 
dent; and it is after having scrutinized him in these moments of 
intimacy that one can estimate and predict the consequences of the 
impulsions of his execrable heart and of his terrifying hungers. 

In the matter of lust-murders our policy was severe; however, 
this fantasy’s adepts were so numerous, requests for permission to 
indulge in it were so frequent, and the price people were willing 
to pay was so high, that we were forced to establish a rate for 
this only too common mania in sanguinary mankind. For one thou- 


Juliette %& 1109 


sand sequins you obtained in our house the right to do to death, 
in the manner of your choosing, either one young boy or one 
young girl. 

But to enjoy all these extravagances and to benefit from the 
intellectual stimulation they afforded, we had, Durand and I, 
set up observation posts, secret alcoves whence, without being seen, 
we commanded a perfect view of everything that transpired in the 
boudoirs used by our libertines; and ‘twas from those vantage 
points we absorbed the richest instruction in a wide range of curious 
refinements. Whenever individuals desiring objects of libertinage 
struck us as worth the trouble observing, we would remove to our 
concealed loges, and there, at leisure, having ourselves fucked, or 
having ourselves frigged, we would dwell profitably upon the 
lascivious details untrammeled debauchery offered to our gaze. 
With my age and my looks, it often fell out that I was chosen in 
preference to one of the creatures the house had for hire; and in 
that case, if the client suited me and the figure seemed to justify it, 
I would prostitute myself unhesitatingly. Likewise, Durand’s 
originalities, her curious caprices and pronounced bent for crime, 
her charms, though somewhat on the decline, often brought in a 
demand for her services; and there were still other times when the 
two of us were contracted for, or when we were included along with 
one or more other girls, and then God knows what orgies they 
were! 

A member of one of Venice’s most distinguished families 
presented himself one day. The libertine’s name: was Cornaro. 

“It is a consuming passion that brings me here,” he an- 
nounced to me, “I must reveal its particulars to you.” 

“Speak forth, my Lord, make your orders known; we do not 
turn anybody away from this house.” 

“Why then, my dear, the thing is this: I require to embugger 
a little boy of seven, lying in the arms of his mother and of his 
aunt. And those two women must themselves sharpen the instru- 
ments which will be used by a helper I shall myself supply: he will 
trepan the child while I am sodomizing it. The operation once over, 
I shall have to embugger the mother, lying upon the body of her 
son; my helper, still using the instruments sharpened by the aunt 
and the mother, will ablate the latter’s buttocks; these, cooked 


1110 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


upon a grill, will be eaten by me, by the two women, and by you too, 
and with this meat we shall none of us drink anything except fine 
brandy.” 

‘What a horror, my Lord!” 

“Yes, yes, tis a horror, I know; but only horrors give me an 
erection, my dear; the worse they are, the more they excite me; 
and but for the fact they are never so horrible as I would like, 
I consider myself a happy man.” 

An appointment was fixed. His surgeon arrived with him, as 
did a pair of vigorous fuckers; Cornaro retired with them into 
a room, telling me that he would call when he needed me. And 
so I withdrew, and went promptly to one of the hiding places 
whence, as I mentioned to you, we were able to watch those of 
our guests from whose capers we expected to derive some pleasure : 
Cornaro set to work, and the effect the spectacle obtained upon 
me is something hardly to be described. 

Two hours later, he summoned me back, I entered. The 
little boy lay sobbing in nis mother’s arms while she covered him 
with her caresses and wet him with her tears. The surgeon, the 
fuckers were drinking, and the young aunt was weeping in the 
company of her sister. 

“Fuck!” expostulated the Venetian, “have you ever, I ask you, 
beheld a more sublime scene?” Then, after contemplating it for a 
moment, ‘‘Why,” he said, feigning surprise, ‘‘are those tears I see? 
You weep, whore, because I am going to kill your son? But what 
interest can you have in this little chap, since he is no longer in 
your womb? Come, let us operate, Juliette, let us operate; do some 
ass-fucking where I can see you while I am in action, take one of 
these bucks, I’ll keep the other: I am unable to do anything unless 
I have a prick in my ass.” 

While I adopt the libertine’s suggestion, he, laying firm hands 
upon the child, camps him atop his mother’s back and fucks him 
while being fucked and while the young aunt, kneeling, sharpens the 
tool needed for the forthcoming operation, under the inspection of 
the surgeon who flogs her in the meantime. I was so placed as to 
be able to miss nothing: although my ass, stoutly perforated, stood 
positively under Cornaro’s nose, he had given orders that my 
fucker retire from time to time and tender him his prick for 


Juliette & 1111 


sucking, which, having sucked it, he would then reinsert in my 
fundament. Everything had been proceeding as he wished, when, 
sensing his sperm about to boil over, he turns his head and nods 
to the surgeon. That artist snatches the blade out of the aunt’s 
hands, and in less time than it takes to tell, he slices the crown off 
not one skull, but all three, scoops the brains out, and braying like 
a donkey, our Venetian notable discharges deep inside the entrails 
of one of the masses he has just deprived of thinking being. He 
withdraws, the three wretched individuals, not yet dead, thrash 
about in the center of the room, and scream.-Does the wildest 
jungle beast commit atrocities of this kind? 

“Ha!” exults Cornaro, ‘“‘nothing has ever given me such 
pleasure; let us finish these victims off,” he goes on, clubbing at 
their heads with a bludgeon, “‘yes, by fuck, let’s finish them off and 
treat ourselves to a little grilled buttock.” 

“Villain!” I say to this barbarian, “do you not repent the 
horrors you have just perpetrated : on 

“Juliette,” he sighed, ‘‘when you reach the point where I am, 
the only thing you rue is an act of virtue.” 

Beside myself from lust, I hugged that divine scoundrel to 
my breast; I frigged him, by imparting delightsome sensations I 
strove to restore the energy he had lost with his ejaculation. He 
teased, he nibbled my teats, sucked my mouth. I whispered dis- 
gusting things in his ear, horrible things; to material titillations I 
added the provocation of lascivious conversation. When I heard 
him ask for my ass I thought my triumph certain; he knelt before 
my buttocks, he toyed with them, squeezed them while tonguing 
the hole for a quarter of an hour: but his prick did not lift out 
of its sagging condition. 

‘‘A discharge leaves me limp for a week,” he apologized; ‘‘the 
enormous amount of time required before I become aroused, the 
copiousness of my seminal loss, the entire thing exhausts me. Let 
us have supper; my forces may return amidst the lewdnesses with 
which we shall punctuate the meal, and perhaps, stuffed with food 
and drink, we shall consummate some further crimes. In the mean- 
time, have yourself fucked within my full view, for there is liber- 
tinage aglitter in your eyes, Juliette, and I should suppose your 
need for a discharge is urgent.” 


1112 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“No,” said I, “‘since you intend to wait, I shall wait too; you 
alone excite me, the others do not: it is your sperm I wish to see 
flow, and nothing else will cause the ejaculation of mine.” 

“If that be the case,” said Cornaro, “let our supper be as 
impure as possible, let us transform it into a frightful orgy. I need 
not specify the details; by now you know my tastes, you will leave 
me nothing to desire.” 

Garbed as a bacchante, Durand, when everything was ready, 
announced to us that supper was served. We removed into a vast 
feasting hall, in whose middle stood a table set for four: Cornaro, 
Durand, myself, and a fifty-year-old woman named Laurentia, 
reputed to be the most profligate, the most corrupt, the most 
lascivious creature in the whole of Italy. Laurentia, like the rest 
of us, elected to eat hurnan flesh, watched philosophically while it 
was brought on, and devoured it without repugnance. 

Nothing so delicate as the various dishes that accompanied 
those sanguinary viands. Eight courses, composed of everything 
of the rarest and most succulent, preceded and followed the 
grillades; but, as had been agreed from the beginning, nothing was 
drunk but the finest old brandy. Eight stewardesses of fourteen, 
with delicious faces, served the brandy: they had it in their mouths, 
and when beckoned, they would step forward and from between 
their rosy lips squirt it down the guest’s parched gullet. A pair of 
fifteen-year-old bardashes stood at attention directly behind each 
guest’s chair, eight in all, ready to execute whatever orders they 
might happen to receive. Deployed at each of the four corners of 
the table was a group made up of two old women, two female 
blackamoors, two vigorous fuckers, two more catamites, two girls 
of eighteen, and two children of seven. A simple gesture to the 
nearest group brought it up to the actor who cared to dally with 
any or all of the subjects composing it. At the four sides of the 
room were that many raised platforms, upon each of which a 
couple of Negroes lashed a girl of sixteen or seventeen who, once 
torn to shreds, would vanish through a trap door, to be replaced 
the same instant by a fresh one; to right and to left of each fusti- 
gator, and upon the same stages, were other Negroes embuggering 
mulatto bardashes, aged between twelve and thirteen. Four girls, 
fifteen years of age, hovered underneath the table: their function 


Juliette & 1113 


was to suck Cornaro’s prick and our cunts. From the ceiling de- 
pended a great candelabrum which at the same time spread 
throughout the hall a light as pure and bright as sunlight, and, 
uncommon particularity, also shot a concentrated and fiery beam 
at a choir of children stationed upon balconies under the arch of 
the ceiling, and, burning them, produced an incessant shrill com- 
plaint from on high. It was that phenomenon which most struck 
Cornaro, the one which amused him more than anything else, and 
for which he had the most fulsome praise. Our man, enraptured, 
after having glanced at everything warranting his notice, sat down, 
protesting that he had never seen anything so lubricious. 

“That woman,” he said, his eyes falling upon Laurentia, 
“what is she ?”’ 

“A bon vivant like yourself,” said Durand, “a slut capable 
of surpassing you in infamy and whose cunt is being frigged at this 
very minute, just as your prick is being sucked.” 

“All very pleasant indeed,” said Cornaro, ‘‘but it seems to me 
that before sitting down at the same table with me, that woman and 
Durand ought to have shown me their behinds.” 

“You are quite right,” the two of them answered, rising 
promptly and bringing their asses to within a few inches of 
Cornaro’s face. 

The libertine palpated them, kissed them; with his connois- 
seur’s discerning gaze still fixed upon them, “These,” he opined, 
“are asses whereupon libertinage has more than once placed its 
stamp; they are in degraded condition, I like it: it is the result of 
the years and the work of lubricity; these blemishes delight me. 
Oh,” he continued, addressing the company at large, “oh, how 
beautiful is corrupted Nature in its details, and how the poppies of 
age are, in my estimation, to be preferred to the roses of childhood! 
Kiss me, heavenly asses! Waft your scented zephyrs toward me, 
and then get back to your places so that we can all prostitute our- 
selves in concert. 

“And these women I see hereabout me?” Cornaro inquired 
next, considering the suppliants surrounding the table. 

“They,” I replied, “are victims who are under sentence of 
death and who, knowing the authority you wield in these parts, 
are on their knees to implore your mercy.” 


1114 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“They shall certainly not obtain any,” the barbarian declared, 
glancing fiercely at them; “many a time have I caused people to 
die, but I have never granted one reprieve or pardon.” 

Therewith we fell to eating, and everyone and everything 
with a role to perform entered into action. 

Cornaro, being sucked uninterruptedly, was halfway stiff al- 
ready; he demanded that each of the victims step forward and 
receive some abuse at his hands. One by one those charming 
creatures rise, begin by presenting their ass to the lewd dignitary, 
and afterward submit humbly to what he is pleased to mete out to 
them. Slaps, pinches, hair-pullings, nose-tweakings, bites, burns, 
buffets, ass-spankings, b-east-twistings, scratches, little is omitted, 
and once they have got what is due them, they return to their 
former places and resume their kneeling position. These prelimi- 
naries over with, Cornaro leans my way, having me take hold of a 
prick whose state I was beginning to feel rather proud of. 

“Those sluts are af‘ecting me,” he confided in my ear, “I may 
soon begin to misbehave.” 

“The means are al! there, my friend,” I replied, “we simply 
await the impulses of your heart and your mind’s instigations; 
speak, and an exemplary submissiveness will give you proof of our 
devotion.” 

Then Cornaro, sornewhat rudely, passed his two hands be- 
neath my buttocks and, pulling me toward him, lifted me a little 
into the air: he called one of the fuckers’ attention to my ass. “Over 
here,” said he, ‘“‘sodomize her as I hold her aloft.” 

A prick sounds my bum, Cornaro’s tongue probes my mouth; 
one of the young servants grasps his prick, another worries his 
ass. 

“Off with you, Juliette,” he says; “hither, Laurentia, take her 
place.” 

The same ceremony ; Laurentia is embuggered, Cornaro sucks, 
at intervals, the prick which is fucking her. Durand’s turn comes 
next; identical episodes. All the women undergo the same fate, all 
are ass-fucked by a fresh fucker who, as before, periodically inter- 
rupts his tupping in order to allow the libertine to lick away the 
maculations acquired during intercourse. The fricatrices are 
changed, and I dispatch the youngest and prettiest girls one by one 


Juliette 1115 


to fondle the rake’s member and to lend their buttoeks to his slaps 
and pounding. 

“Let us eat,” he finally says. ‘“That will do by way of prologue, 
we shall refine our gestures as we proceed. Juliette,” he asks me, 
“what is your view? Is there any more divine passion in the world 
than lust ?” 

“I would venture to say that there is not; but lust must be 
carried to excess: in libertinage, he who applies curbs is a fool 
who denies himself all possibility of ever knowing what pleasure 
is.” = 

“Libertinage,” Durand put in, “is a sensual aberrance which 
supposes the discarding of all restraints, the supremest disdain for 
all prejudices, the total rejection of all religious notions, the pro- 
foundest aversion to all ethical imperatives; and that libertine who 
has not attained this philosophical maturity, tossing back and forth 
between his desires’ impetuousness and the bullying of his con- 
science, will be debarred from perfect happiness.” 

“I donot think,” said Laurentia, “that fault can be found with 
his Lordship upon any of the articles that have just been enumer- 
ated, and I am convinced he has intelligence enough to be immune 
to the effects of commonplace ideas.” 

“It is in any case certain,” said Cornaro, “that I acknowledge 
the sanctity of absolutely nothing in human society, and that for 
the great good reason that everything men have instituted is 
absolutely nothing but the product of their self-interest and their 
prejudices. Is there a single man alive anywhere who can legiti- 
mately assure me that he knows more about the world than I do? 
Once one has ceased to have any belief in religion and therefore in 
a God’s idiotic confidences to mortals, everything of man’s invention 
must be subjected to the closest scrutiny and consigned immediately 
to scorn, if in me Nature’s urgings are to despise and trample 
upon those lies. Hence, once it is demonstrated that in the spheres 
of religion, of morals, and of politics, no man can be better informed 
than I, I may, as of that moment, be as wise as he, and from then on 
nothing he announces to me can rightfully claim my respect. It is in 
the lawful power of no human being to force me to believe or 
accept what he says or thinks; and however little regard I have 
for these human reveries, however much I flout them, there is no 


1116 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


person on earth who can pretend to the right to censure or punish 
me therefor. Into what chasm of errors or foolishness would we 
not tumble were all men blindly to adhere to what it suited some 
other men to establish! And through what incredible injustice will 
you call moral that which emanates from you; immoral that which 
I uphold? To what arbitration shall we apply in order to find out 
upon which side right arid reason lie? 

“But, some will object, there are certain things so visibly in- 
famous that no possible doubt can exist of their danger and their 
horribleness. For my part, dear friends, I sincerely declare that I 
know of no deed answering to this description, none which, recom- 
mended by Nature, has not at some time in the past formed the 
basis of some hallowed custom; and, finally, none which being 
seasoned by some attractions, does not through that fact alone 
become legitimate and good. Whence I conclude that there is not 
one which ought to be resisted, not one without its usefulness, not 
one which has not had somebody’s sanction in its favor. 

“But, it will be most stupidly said, since you were born under 
this or that latitude, you ought to abide by the usages prevalent 
there. Bah, enough; you are being absurd in wanting to persuade me 
that I should put up with wrongs done me because of accidents of 
birthplace; I am such as I was formed by Nature; and if there be 
a jar between my penchants and the laws of my country, blame 
Nature for it, impute nce fault to me. 

“But, it will be added, you will be a menace to society, society 
shall have to protect itself, to remove you from its midst. Plati- 
tudes. Renounce your senseless curbs, and give equally, equitably, 
to all persons the right to revenge themselves for the wrong done 
them, do that and you shall have no more need of codes of law, 
you will have no more need of the brainless calculations of those 
bloated pedants that go under the amusing title of criminalists, 
who, clumsily weighing in the scales of their ineptness actions 
beyond the grasp of their somber genius, refuse to realize that when 
Nature is all roses for us, she can necessarily be nothing but 
thistles for them. 

‘‘Abandon man to Nature, she will be a far better guide to him 
than your legislators. Destroy, above all, these populous cities, 
where the accumulation of vices drives you to repressive law- 


Juliette & 1117 


making. What necessity is there that man live in society? Restore 
him to the forest wilderness whence he came, and let him do there 
whatever he likes. His crimes, as isolated as he, will then be an 
inconvenience to no one, and there will be no further purpose for 
your restrictive regulations; savage man is subject to two needs 
only: the need to fuck and the need to eat; both are implanted in 
him by Nature. Nothing he will do in answer to the one or the 
other of these needs can possibly be criminal; if ever passions other 
than these are found in him, only civilization and society engendered 
them. Well, as soon as it is clear that these recent offenses are 
nothing but the fruit of circumstances, that they are inherent in 
social man’s way of life, by what right, if you please, do you blame 
him for them? 

“There, then, are the only two species of offenses man can be 
subject to: (1) those imposed upon him by the state of savagery: 
now, would it not be sheer madness on your part to punish him 
for these? and (2) those his social existence amidst other men 
inspire in him; would it not be yet more extravagant to deal severely 
with these? And so what is there left for you to do, ignorant and 
stupid moderns, when you see crimes committed? You should 
admire, and you should hold your tongue; admire . . . yes, most 
certainly, for nothing is so fascinating, nothing so arresting nor 
so beautiful as man swept away by his passions; hold your tongue 
. .. even more certainly, for what you behold is the handiwork of 
Nature, toward whom your proper attitude must be one of breath- 
less awe and silent respect. 

‘As regards my own self and personal affairs, I concur in 
your view, my friends, that the world can boast of no more im- 
moral man than me; there is not a single prohibition I have not 
violated, not a principle out of whose grip I have not delivered 
myself, not a virtue I have failed to outrage, not one crime I have 
neglected to commit; and I must confess that ’tis only when I have 
acted in uttermost defiance of all social conventions, of all human 
laws, that I have really felt lust throb in my heart and inflame it 
with its divine fire. Every criminal or ferocious deed excites me; to 
murder on the highways, that would excite me; to ply the hangman’s 
trade, that would excite me. And so why deny oneself these deeds, 
once they hurl one’s senses into such a voluptuous ferment?” 


1118 «» THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


” 


“Ah,” Laurentia murmured, “to murder on the highways. .. . 

“Yes, indeed. That is perpetrating violence, any violence 
agitates the senses; any sort of nervous emotion, directed by the 
imagination, essentially quickens pleasure. If, therefore, my prick 
rises at the prospect of going out and killing somebody on the 
highway, that action, to which I am impelled by the same principle 
that moves me to unbutton my breeches or lift a petticoat, must be 
excused on the same grounds, and I shall therefore commit it with 
the same indifference, but nevertheless with greater pleasure, be- 
cause its capacity to irritate is greater.” 

“What,” said my companion, “has the idea of God never 
checked your misbehavior ?” 

“Ah, do not talk to me about that ignoble chimera, it was 
already the object of my derision by the time I reached the age of 
twelve. I shall never be able to understand how any man in his 
senses can pay an instant’s heed to a disgusting fable which the 
heart abjures, which reason disavows, and which can win partisans 
only among fools, low knaves, or imposters. Were there actually 
any such thing as a God, master and creator of the universe, he 
would be, incontestably, if one is to judge by the notions wide- 
spread among his sectators, the most bizarre, the cruelest, the 
most wickedly spiteful, and the most bloodthirsty of figures; and 
none of us would have energy enough, force enough, to hate him, to 
execrate him, to revile him, and to profane him to the degree he 
would deserve. The greatest service legislators could render 
humanity would be an ironclad law against theocracy. Few realize 
how important it is to obliterate that hideous God’s baneful altars; 
until those fatal ideas can no longer rearise, man will know neither 
rest nor peace on earth, and the threat of religious strife will 
always be poised over our heads. A government that permits all 
forms of worship has not absolutely fulfilled the philosophic 
objective toward which we must all aim: it must go farther, it 
must expel from society’s bosom those elements which may hamper 
its action. Well, I shall demonstrate to you whenever you like that 
no government will ever be vigorous or stable so long as it allows 
in the country any worship of a Supreme Being—that Pandora’s 
Box, that keen-edged weapon destructive of every government, 
that appalling system in virtue of which everybody fancies he has 


Juliette & 1119 


the right to cut everybody else’s throat every day. Let him die a 
thousand deaths, the man who thinks to preach a God, in any 
country however governed. The blessed scoundrel the feeble- 
minded revere has no other purpose than to sap the foundations of 
the State; inside it he endeavors to form an independent caste, the 
everlasting foe of happiness and equality; he strives to achieve 
dominion over his compatriots, he strives to light the fires of dis- 
cord, and ends up enchaining the people, with whom he is aware 
he shall be able to do whatever he wishes once he has blinded them 
by superstition and gangrened them by fanaticism.” 

“And yet,” Durand remarked, merely for the sake of hearing 
our man’s conversation, “religion is the cornerstone of morality; 
and morals, however you have twisted them, none the less remain 
very essential in a government.” 

“Of whatever nature you may suppose this government,” 
Cornaro rejoined, “I shall prove to you that morality is useless to 
it. And morality, furthermore, what do you mean by the term? Is 
it not the practice of all social virtues? Will you then be so kind 
as to tell me what bearing the practice of any virtue can possibly 
have upon the workings of government? Are you afraid that the 
vice which is the opposite of these virtues might upset those work- 
ings? Never. Nay, it is far less important that governmental 
action be exerted against corrupt persons than against moral 
persons. The latter are addicted to arguing, and you will never 
have a solid government where men spend their time using their 
rational faculties: for government is a brake upon men, and the 
man with a mind wants no brakes upon him. Whence it is that the 
shrewdest lawmakers were eager to bury in ignorance the men they 
sought to rule; they sensed that the chains they meant to impose 
were more apt to keep the imbecile on his knees than the individual 
of genius. You are going to reply to me that in a free government 
this cannot be the lawmaker’s desire. And I am going to ask you 
what government is free; does any such thing exist anywhere on 
earth? More, can a single free government possibly exist? Is not 
man everywhere the slave of laws? And, once this is so, does that 
not mean he is everywhere in chains? Once enchained, is it not the 
desire of his oppressor, whoever he may be, to maintain man in that 
state where he can be most easily held captive? Now, is that state 


1120 <b THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


not plainly the state of immorality? The kind of drunken rapture 
the immoral and corrupt man perpetually vegetates in, is that not 
the state in which his legislator can maintain him most conveniently, 
paralyze him most easily? Why then should the legislator wish to 
inject virtues into him? Never save when man purges himself does 
he grow restive, contentious, examine his governors, and change the 
regime. For your government’s sake, pinion the citizen by means of 
immorality, drown him in immorality . . . and he will never cause 
you any trouble. I ask you, moreover, looking at things in a 
broader sense, I ask you whether vices are of any consequence in 
dealings between men: what matters it to the State whether Peter 
robs John, or whether, in his turn, John murders Peter? It is per- 
fectly absurd to imagine that these various tit-for-tats can be of the 
slightest consequence to the State. But there must be laws to keep 
crime in check. . . . What need is there to keep crime in check? 
Crime is necessary to Nature’s right functioning, her laws expect 
it, it is the counterweight to virtue: and it beseems human beings 
to undertake to repress it! The man of the primeval forest, say, 
did he have laws holding his passions in check, and did he lead an 
any less happy existence than you? Fear not lest strength be ever dis- 
comfited by weakness; if the latter always comes away the loser, 
tis because Nature wills that it be thus; and it is not for you to 
oppose her law.” 

“That,” said I, “is a system which opens wide the door to 
every sort of horror.” 

“But they are indispensable, horrors: does not Nature con- 
vince us of it when she causes the most virulent poisons to grow 
cheek to jowl with the most wholesome plants? Why do you 
object to crime? Not because you find it evil in itself, but because 
it is prejudicial to you: do you suppose, however, that the man who 
is served by crime thinks to condemn it? Why, no! If then crime 
makes for as much happiness in the world as unhappiness, where 
is the justice of the law that punishes it? The character of a good 
law must be to promote the welfare of everybody; the law you 
promulgate against crime will not achieve anything of the sort, it 
will satisfy no one but the victim of the offense, and will probably 
supremely displease the agent. The great shortcoming, the final 
misfortune of men is, in their lawmaking, never to consider more

than one fraction of humanity and always to utterly disregard the 
rest; you wonder that so many blunders are committed, now you 
know why.” 

We had reached that point in the discussion when a servant 
came to announce to us that a woman plunged in extremest poverty 
was waiting downstairs, and earnestly desired to have a few words 
with Signor Cornaro. 

“Send her in,’ I said before the Venetian had a chance to 
reply. 

The women surrounding the table immediately got up from 
their knees to make room for the ensuing scene, and joined the 
fifty sultanas who were exhibiting their asses upon the four stages. 

A moment later there entered, with modesty, a pregnant 
woman of about thirty, as lovely as Venus, and followed by two 
little boys belonging to her, one of whom was fourteen, the other 
thirteen, and by two girls, also her children, aged fifteen and twelve. 

“Oh, my Lord!” she cried, she and the rest of her family 
sinking down at the feet of Cornaro, the perfect dupe of a scene 
I had arranged with a view to playing upon his susceptibilities, “oh, 
my Lord, my Lord! ’tis your kindness I implore; in the name of 
heaven, have pity upon a poor woman abandoned by her husband 
and the mother of these unhappy children you see begging you for 
bread. For two years now have we been destitute; without work, 
without resources, the grave must soon claim us all five if harsh 
mankind persists in denying us any means to prolong our existence. 
Oh, good sir! look not unmeltingly upon the wretchedness that 
invokes your compassion: succor us, else we must perish.” 

As I said, this woman’s appearance was delicious; her negli- 
gent dress, her pregnancy, graces distributed everywhere about her 
person, the enchanting looks of her children, the tears bathing the 
cheeks of everyone in this fascinating family: so incendiary was 
the general effect, so furiously did it inflame our libertine’s criminal 
lust, that for an instant I thought he was going to discharge before 
a finger was laid upon him. But he fought his feelings into line, ’twas 
for much more piquant scenes the rascal was reserving himself; and 
*twas to execute them he took me with him into a chamber nearby, 
whither the victims I have just described had been promptly 
directed. 


1122 -& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And now that cannibal’s ferocity attains full flower. He is 
beside himself; incoherent speech declares his extreme disorder, he 
stammers, babbles, his words are foul, his phrases unconnected, 
his ideas blasphemous, dreadful. I shall continue to portray him in 
this distracted mood: no aspect of the subject can be left obscure 
by the artist who undertakes to portray for mankind the monstros- 
ities of Nature. 

‘Well then, bitch,” says he upon making his entrance, “I have 
come to relieve you; you are gravid, I am going to make you whelp. 
Quickly, strip... naked, naked, and buttocks especially . . . Juliette, 
I stiffen, I stiffen considerably . . . rub alcohol on my balls. . . but get 
these sluts out of their clothes, and make haste... .” 

And, pronouncing these words, he aims a terrible punch at 
the mother’s face: blackens her eye, breaks one of her teeth, sends 
her crashing twenty feet away; and the brute, the while leering at 
her, handles my ass so ungently that, fearing lest he turn upon me, 
I hurriedly remove the rz.gs covering the poor wretch, already fallen 
to the floor which her tears and her blood are soon to wet. Having 
to stoop over to undress her, I make the fairest exposition of my 
behind: lewd Cornaro takes firm grasp upon it and embuggers me. 

“Strip her,” he cries, “pull the clothes off her body, tear them 
off, strangle her if she resists; are you insensitive to my erection?” 

Cornaro now demands that the unlucky creature get upon her 
knees and beg me to undress her; and while she is doing so, he 
spits in her face. Once she is in the state he desires, he quits my 
ass, jerks her to her feet, then, himself, in the twinkling of an eye, 
snatches everything they are wearing off the two boys and the two 
little girls, and assails those four behinds with the most heavy- 
handed and the most loathsome caresses. Then, ordering me to 
sear the mother’s buttocks with a candle-flame for a few moments, 
“That will do,” he cries, ‘“‘now give me some switches.” 

These instruments having been furnished him, he has the 
mother stretch out upon her back; then, upon her swollen belly, he 
establishes the four children, one atop the other, which provides him 
with a belly and four behinds to flagellate. First, he kisses, paws 
that pyramid of charms, he praises their beauty, expresses wonder 
that poverty and privation have made no visible inroads upon these 
unhappy creatures’ health or plumpness. Then, shifting from sur- 


Juliette 1123 


prise to wickedness, and plying his switches with the speed of light, 
he thrashes the targets set tier on tier, from that overripe, snow- 
white belly to the uppermost of those eight appetizing buttocks. I 
frigged him during the operation, and resorted to the most 
atrocious and sanguinary stratagems to keep his energy from flag- 
ging. Now and again, when he would pause to rest, when he would 
gaze gloatingly at the stripes and slashes his barbarity had inflicted, 
he would thrust his prick into my ass, withdraw after three or four 
stabs, and resume his baleful fustigations. Weary of this inaugural 
pleasure, he gave it up in favor of pressing the young mother’s 
belly, of kneading it, beating it, hammering it with his fists, and 
while he did so he was covering the four children’s bloody behinds 
with his kisses. 

Positions are altered; he lays the mother in the middle of 
the bed, upon her back; between her legs establishes each of the 
children, one after the other, and embuggers them while inflicting 
every kind of painful outrage upon the mother’s belly. 

‘‘My friend,” I say, “you are in discharging humor, I can see it 
in your eyes: a little more and this scene will cost you your fuck, 
after which you will be unable either to consummate your crime 
or to enjoy the further episodes which ought to precede its accom- 
plishment.” 

“And what other entertainment do you intend to provide me?” 
the Venetian inquired, his head reeling from lubricity. 

“Come with me,” said I, “leave these creatures to catch 
their breath, you shall return to them in a few minutes.” 

I drew him into a little room where Durand, with the aid of. 
Laurentia, had just completed preparing the new scene you are 
now to behold. 

That room was decorated to represent one of those temples 
where the Saturnalia were celebrated in the Rome of olden days. 
Nine lubricious tableaux greeted the Venetian’s eyes. 

The first featured a handsome man in middle years, prick aloft 
and hovering close to the ass of a little boy, whom a catamite was 
caressing. 

In the second was seen a woman of forty frigging a girl of 
fifteen, herself being frigged by a girl of eighteen. 


1124 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


In the third was a vigorous athlete ass-fucking a beautiful 
Negress and cunt-sucking a pretty white woman. 

In the fourth, a mother flogging her daughter and being 
flogged herself by a man. 

The fifth offered a man embuggering a calf and being sod- 
omized by a large dog. 

The sixth, a man whipping his own daughter, bound to a step- 
ladder; he was in the meantime receiving a lashing from somebody 
else. 

The seventh, a group of ten girls, all ten with tongue in cunt. 

The eighth, a group of ten men, one embuggering the next, 
and so curiously disposed were the ten attached actors that they 
formed one spherical mass. 

In the ninth and last you saw men embuggering halfwit or 
syphilitic girls all the while they were cunt-sucking beldams of 
sixty at least, and small boys were nibbling their asses. 

In the middle of al. that, a couple of matrons looked to be 
offering Cornaro six little girls, aged only two or three, all naked, 
all as pretty as little cherubs. Everybody wore wreaths of flowers, 
everybody was in action. From all sides nothing could be heard 
but cries, whether of pleasure or of pain, and the whistling of 
thongs and the impact of leather upon flesh. Everybody was naked; 
everybody illustrated lewdness in its most scandalous colors. Lamps 
burning scented oil created an agreeable illumination and at the 
same time shed an encharting odor throughout the place, crowning 
touches added to so manv others that rendered this temple one of 
the most delicious sanctuzries that was ever edified for lust. 

Our man wanders among the formations; two masculine 
fuckers and two feminine whippers follow him wherever he goes, 
applying themselves by turns to irritate his ass in all possible 
manners.* Here, the lecher squeezes or wrings a teat; there, he 
tickles or claws a cunt; farther along, blows of his fist bloody a 
pretty face. Tis the raging tiger loose in the sheepfold. 

‘‘All right,” says he, “let’s have an end to this, I cannot endure 


4Never is one’s desire for a prick in the behind so keen as directly after a 
whipping; and never does one more keenly desire the whip than just after an ass- 
fucking. ’Tis incredible how these two pleasures hang together and mutually feed 
each other. 


Juliette & 1125 


any more. But I wish to operate before a public, I wish to join the 
pleasure of creating a scandal to the horrors which will finally 
bring my sperm forth. Give me half a dozen girls and as many 
young men, the most sensitive and honorable and decent ones you 
have here; they will stand about me while I act, and I shall do my 
best to give the most appalling performance possible.” 

I promptly bring him what he asks for, and we all troop into 
the chamber where the unhappy family is waiting for us. The crowd 
surrounds Cornaro. Death is decreed for those who prove unable to 
bear the spectacle, or who wilt before it, or weep. Cornaro lays 
hands on the mother; he hangs her by the feet from the ceiling, 
thus causing her to be stifled by the child in her womb. He has the 
prettier of the two daughters held by her sister and embuggers 
her; then, armed with a carpenter's saw, he slowly severs the poor 
creature’s head, while doing so sodomizing her steadily. The cruel 
man made that execrable operation last over an hour. It upset three 
of the feminine spectators, who collapsed and from falling sustained 
serious hurt. 

“Mark them,” said Cornaro, “I shall attend to them when I 
have finished over here.” 

The neck is at last cut all the way through. Another member 
of the family is brought forward; and it is not until Cornaro has 
installed himself in the ass of the last of the children, a boy, not 
until he has hacked through the neck of this last victim, that the 
villain unleashes the tides of foamy sperm whose seething has 
rendered him so ferocious. Before the end came, three more mem- 
bers of the audience, all feminine, had swooned; and all the others 
had given way to tears. As for the mother, she was no more: the 
pressure of the child weighing upon her diaphragm had suffocated 
her. Thus it was that in this horrible den one beheld nought but 
crime’s incarnation on the one side, and its sinister effects on the. 
other. 

“Why, what is this, my friend!” said I, approaching the 
culprit and rattling his device, “what! you are going to leave these 
victims unpunished, you are not going to carry out the sentence 
you pronounced against them?” 

“No,” sighed the Venetian, “I am exhausted; I am not sur- 
feited with crime, but it has worn me out. I need rest... .” 


1126 e THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


Despairing of extracting anything further from him, I had him 
served a cup of hot broth, and he withdrew after having paid 
one hundred thousand francs for the orgies he had just celebrated. 

Following Cornaro, the next of our memorable visitors was a 
Venetian lady of quality and outstanding wealth, very famous for 
her debauchery. Silvia, forty-five years of age, tall, superbly 
proportioned and with the most beautiful eyes possible, arrived 
for a three days’ sojourn at our house. 

‘My friends,” she announced to us, “I have a repletion of fuck 
which cannot be let otherwise than in horrors, and these I desire 
in every kind. To begin with,” continued this contemporary 
Messalina, “I want you to prostitute me to some libertine, bizarre 
in his tastes, who will take me upon an extended promenade through 
the most noisome hogwallows of dissoluteness.” 

“IT have someone ready downstairs, and I believe he is the 
personage you require. However, Signora, he will undoubtedly 
lift hands against you. Nay, he is sure to thrash you.” 

‘“‘Ah, dear heart, that is all I ask; I burn to be the victim of 
such a libertine. ... What will he do to me after that?” 

‘After having treated you like the lowliest of the low, he will 
oblige you to frig pricks upon his face; he will have you cunt-fucked 
while he looks on, and he will conclude by embuggering you.” 

“Delicious!” was Si.via’s reply; “that is exactly what I am 
looking for. Let us begin the scene at once; later, I shall indicate 
to you the way in which I would have it terminate.’ 

I had the man in question brought up. It so happened that he 
had requested someone of precisely Silvia’s age and shape; great 
was his joy at being introcluced to her. Our two actors were swiftly 
come to grips; and I, behind my partition, nonchalantly reclining 
between a set of girls frigging me before and behind, I missed not 
a detail of the ceremony. Dorsini opened with a dozen stout kicks 
delivered to the ass, rapidly succeeded by twenty slaps in the face 
and eight or ten fist-blows, but all that meted out with such speed 
that Silvia might have thought she was caught in a hailstorm. She 
remains of firm countenance.withal, and the expression in her eyes is 
of nothing unless it be pleasure. That flurry of hands is followed by 
tirades of hard language; rarely has a woman been insulted as 
Dorsini insults his partner. 


Juliette 2 1127 


“Very well,” says he, “let pricks be fetched in; I want to see 
how this whore does her work.”’ 

Six first-rate fuckers appear; Silvia, naked, her buttocks 
pressed against the rufhan’s belly, empties out the engines, spraying 
their contents over Dorsini’s face; he is dripping with sperm; she 
rubs it upon his nose; his prick has scarcely begun to stir. A further 
half-dozen youths appear; he orders them to fuck his high-born 
whore. 

‘Bleeding Christ!” he exclaims, watching her squirm beneath 
them, “what a jade, what licentiousness! You have some heat in 
you, eh, old bag of bones? Make some noise, whore, curse a bit, 
tell Almighty God what you think of Him.” 

And it is by a torrent of invectives against the Eternal that 
Silvia responds to this invitation. Never was the idiom of blasphemy 
carried so far. Of that I would probably still be persuaded today 
had not Dorsini contrived to outdo her. While swearing, the mis- 
creant was frigging himself, fondling the fuckers’ behinds one by 
one, and fondling that of his slut also. At length he has her turn 
around; a vigorous fucker who encunts her exposes her hindquarters 
to Dorsini, who, after a preliminary examination of that ass, an 
examination which is not, as you might suppose, conducted with- 
out a few vexations, trains his member at the immoral orifice and 
flings thereinto in a matter of moments. Silvia endures everything 
and never once flinches: for true it decidedly is that one may glean 
as much delight in the patient’s role as in the agent’s: the imagina- 
tion is the only cradle where pleasures are born, it alone creates, 
fashions, orients them; where the imagination is still, when it does 
not contribute inspiration or embellishment, all that remains is the 
physical act, dull, gross, and brutish. 

But Dorsini, being himself embuggered while embuggering, 
excites himself only temporarily in the anus; the mouth is the 
shrine where he is ordinarily wont to sacrifice, tis there his homage 
is normally consummated; he roars out his need for the mouth, 
Silvia lends hers, he lodges himself there without interrupting his 
copulatory motions and discharges to the great contentment of the 
hussy, who sucks him with an ardor wholly appropriate to her 
whorishness, and all the dreadful disorder of her lubricious mind. 
Dorsini pays and takes his leave. 


1128 ds THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘Let us share it,” Silvia said to me, “I like money earned in 
the whorehouse, it has always brought me good luck. Well, that 
has limbered me sufficiently,” she went on, ‘‘we can now proceed 
with the rest.”’ 

The shameless creature then gathered twenty-five superb men 
and twenty-five girls of exceeding beauty together in a spacious 
drawing room, and for the next sixteen hours gave herself over, 
with myself as witness, to the most monstrous riot of debauchery, 
to the most inordinate and unseemly passions, to whimsies at once 
foul beyond words and beyond belief extraordinary in a woman 
who, necessarily, could have contracted such habits only after first 
having renounced all concern for her reputation, all principles of 
modesty and virtue, whereof, according to the legend, our sex 
must be the exclusive repository, and from which we women never 
depart save it be to surpass everything men can achieve of the most 
execrable in this kind. 

Silvia, all afire, ended up with cruelties; this is customary. Here 
is the horror she invented. For victim she chose a little boy of 
thirteen, fair as an angel. 

“I am going to reduce him to such an extremity that he’ll be fit 
for nothing but burial in a few days. For how much are you willing 
to sell him to me ?” 

‘One thousand sequins.” 

The bargain is concluded. 

The rascal has this child secured to a curved bench, in such 
a way that, as though he were over a barrel, his ass is entirely 
exposed ; Silvia then squats over the face of a handsome young man 
lying upon the piles of cushions, and has her cunt licked by him 
while another, on all fours, comes up from behind and tongues her 
ass. Excited by these proceedings, she picks up a lighted candle 
and gleefully scorches the buttocks, chars the asshole of the victim 
who, as you must surely imagine, utters frightful screams through- 
out the operation. As for Silvia, she discharges; swearing like a 
trooper, the slut goes into an ecstasy, and ferocity brings her to 
the poirit where, having had the child turned over, with her teeth 
she tears away its genitals. We bore the boy out unconscious, he 
died three days later; and Silvia, triumphant, after having paid 


Juliette & 1129 


me a king’s ransom, was before very long back with us again to 
renew similar horrors. 

’Twas to her recommendation we owed the visit paid us 
several months afterward by Senator Bianchi, one of the Republic’s 
richest figures, and aged about thirty-five. That libertine’s mania 
was to betake himself to a brothel with his two nieces, whom he 
had in ward, and to prostitute them there. Though he had striven 
to annihilate modesty in those two young girls’ souls, the influence 
of an exemplary upbringing was yet strong enough in them to 
transform the experience into an ordeal. They blushed red when 
I looked at them; thus covered with confusion, all their candor 
shone forth, further enhancing the graces wherewith Nature had 
ornamented them: no living creature could have been lovelier than 
either one of those two. Simply to gaze at the pair sufficed to make 
me embrace the roué’s lewd scheme; and I could not resist employ- 
ing certain formulas calculated to scandalize those chaste ears. 

‘What order of merchandise do these whores require,” I 
asked the Senator, ‘do they like their meat fat or lean?” 

“They are too shy to answer, look and see for yourself,” 
Bianchi replied, raising the skirts of the one and the other, 
‘measure their cunts and gauge their needs.” 

“Good,” said I, after a certain amount of poking about with 
my fingers, “it’s something not too filling that seems to be called 
for.” 

“To the contrary!” Bianchi protested. “I want these child- 
ren to grow; give me the biggest articles you have.” 

And in accordance with this expressive order, at which the 
poor dears’ crimson cheeks only paled a little, I produce six young 
fuckers the least of whose members showed a foot in length by 
eight inches in circumference. 

‘That is what I want,” our man says to me as he handles the 
goods; “but six are too few. You don’t know these young ladies’ 
appetites; meek as lambs they may appear to you, but when they 
fuck, they fuck like she-wolves, and I venture to say that it will 
take twelve men if they are to be satisfied at all.” 

‘Well, here are another six. And you, amiable libertine,” I 
ask, “what shall be your needing? What are you wont to do while 
your nieces are being dishonored ?” 


1130 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“T fuck boys; get me six of them, and nothing older than 
twelve.” 

I have them for him in an instant; by the time the operation 
begins I am at my post, for I need hardly tell you that I was not 
one to miss many such scenes. 

That libertine performed horrors, and upon his nieces had 
still worse performed. Ele died not long after his visit to us, and in 
expiring the wicked patrician disinherited his unlucky wards. So 
it was that by and by, having already endured severest hardships, 
they came to seek refugz with us, and it was granted them at the 
price of a prostitution whence we earned a pretty penny. It was the 
younger of the two, that is to say, one of the loveliest girls in 
Europe, that I provided to a man whose passion merits a separate 
article in this encyclopaedia of inhuman lewd practices. 

Alberti was a tall and sinewy man of fifty-five years or so, 
whose mere glance sufhiczd to petrify a woman. I showed him the 
beautiful and delicate child I had appointed to him. He bids me 
remove her clothes, and then examines her, palpating her uncouthly 
or as one might a horse whose defects one wishes to ascertain. 
Not a word during this inspection; not a gesture indicative of 
lubricity; nothing apart from a bright light in his eyes, and his 
labored breathing. 

“Is she pregnant?” he asked me after a while, applying his 
muscular hands to her belly. 

“T do not believe so,’ I rejoined. 

‘A pity; I am prepared to pay double when they are. In any 
case, knowing the purpose I shall be putting it to, what is your 
figure for this animal ?” 

‘Two thousand sequins.” 

“You'd get it if she were pregnant; since she isn’t, you'd 
better take half.” 

The bargaining was conducted in the victim’s presence; we 
finally reached an understanding and I sold her. Bought, she was 
immediately shut away in a small chamber in our house, so thick- 
walled and narrow and isolated that there was no chance of her 
cries being heard. There, with some straw to lie upon, the wretch’s 
sufferings were to last nine days: her ration of food was to be 


Juliette & 1131 


reduced gradually during the first four, thereafter she was to be 
fed nothing whatever. Each day the fierce Alberti would come to 
torment his victim; he would spend two hours doing it: Rosalba 
and I were regular witnesses to those sessions, along with another 
girl who was changed every day. 

Upon his first visit, the first thing that cruel libertine did was 
press the victim’s buttocks and breasts; he pressed them forcefully; 
he softened them, pinched them, crushed them with such skill that 
in less than an hour those four globes of flesh were all black and 
blue. Placed opposite him, my ass was on an exact level with his lips, 
he kissed my behind while toiling over his prisoner; in the mean- 
time Rosalba frigged him, and the third girl flogged him as hard 
as she could. Lost in meditation, nothing came from Alberti’s 
mouth but a few unconnected words, occasionally interspersed with 
oaths. 

“Vile flesh,” he remarked ironically, ‘‘execrable ass. Such offal 
is fit for nothing but to be boiled down into soap.’ And every 
grace embellished the objects he dared refer to in that manner. He 
did not discharge. 

On the second day the proceedings were the same as on the 
first; on the third, the fleshy parts of the victim were in such a 
swollen, such a woeful state, that she was taken by a high fever. 

“Excellent,” said Alberti, “this is better than I expected; my 
intention was not to halt her food until the fourth day, but in the 
light of these developments, it can be stopped now.” And he 
continued to squeeze, to compress. Toward the close of the visit 
he sodomized the victim, while pinching her thighs vigorously; then 
the girl assisting us was treated likewise, and my behind was 
tongued. The next three days’ episodes were identical; never once 
did he discharge. By then, the victim’s buttocks and breasts 
resembled steer hides that had been cured in the sun, and the fever, 
having continued to rise despite the suspension of nourishment, we 
wondered whether the wretch would last until the ninth day. 

“She had better be given confession,” Alberti said to me at 
the conclusion of the eighth day's activities; ‘‘she will die without 
fail tomorrow.” 

This precaution made me laugh; but when I learned that the 


1132 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lecher wanted to be a secret witness to the ceremony, and that it 
was but a further vehicle to his lubricity, I fell in gladly with the 
idea. 

A monk came and confessed the sufferer while in the adjoining 
room, between Rosalba and me, Alberti listened to all that was 
said. This episode appeared to entertain him enormously. 

“God blast me!” sad he while we frigged him, “the plight she 
is in, tis uniquely my doing. Oh, how I love to hear the slut tell of 
her sins... .”” And, having previously warned the doomed creature 
that the confessor was hard of hearing we lost not a syllable of 
that pious exchange. The monk disappears; the lecher enters. Ex- 
hausted by hunger, by fever, and by contusions, the young girl looks 
to be ready to give up the ghost. Such is the spectacle the villain 
wishes to enjoy. He settles himself squarely in front of her and 
while he embuggers Rosalba, while the girl accompanying us flogs 
him, he orders me to carry forward the work he has been pursuing 
for a week. I approach the victim, I lay hands on those derelict 
parts, I tug, I squeeze; and at the second or third application of 
pressure, the miserable thing, worn out by such prolonged suffer- 
ings, falls at our feet, Hifeless. And it is at that instant our Alberti 
discharges. But, mercifu. heavens! what an outpouring: never in 
all my days had I seen such a lengthy nor such an impetuous ex- 
penditure of sperm. He was for more than ten minutes in ecstasy; 
no clyster, however copious, could have yielded results quantita- 
tively comparable to that villain’s ejaculation. 

Alberti became one of our best clients: not a month went by 
but he passed a nine-dav period under our roof. We soon gave 
him Bianchi’s other niece; she was more delicately constituted 
than her sister, however, and expired on the seventh day. 

Concurrently with all this Durand was enjoying a great 
success with her cabinet of marvels. So extensively had she informed 
herself touching all the irtrigues in town that in a very short space 
she was in a position to tell everybody his fortune. She learned 
that Senator Contarini, father of the most gloriously beautiful 
young daughter, was head over heels in love with her; having 
found that out, she went to see him. 

“Rouse in your charming Rosina the desire to hear what the 
stars portend for her,” said Durand; “‘mention my house; I shall 


Juliette & 1133 


hide you there, and guarantee you the fullest enjoyment of her in 
the course of the various ceremonies I shall prescribe that she 
undergo in order to discover her destiny.” The Senator, trans- 
ported, promises Durand everything her heart desires if only she 
succeeds. The modest sorceress inquires to know the father’s pas- 
sions; and as in his reply he alluded to all sorts of requirements, 
she asked him for three thousand sequins. Contarini was a wealthy 
man; he paid half the sum in advance; and the rendezvous was 
made for two days hence. 

Very eager to have her future foretold, Rosina writes to 
Durand, requesting an audience, and in her answer the latter 
proposes the same day she and the Senator have already agreed 
upon. Rosina arrives, sends her duenna home; and I do declare 
that when that superb child was rid of the thin veils enveloping 
her, it was as though we were beholding a sunrise. Figure to your- 
self that most perfect thing heaven can make, and you will still 
have but an imperfect idea of the fascinating girl whom I shall, 
though it be in vain, endeavor to describe to you. 

Rosina, sixteen years of age, tall and shaped like one of the 
Graces, belonged to the line of those virgins immortalized by the 
brush of the painter Albani. Her chestnut tresses fell in gently 
curling waves upon her alabaster breast; her large blue eyes 
inspired at once love and desire; and to those lips of freshest pink 
would be drawn anyone who sought the spirit of the divinity of 
whom Rosina was the pure embodiment. No skin was ever so fair; 
no breasts were ever so round; no thighs were ever so plump; never 
was there a cunt so strait, so warm, so dainty and sweet; and 
buttocks! ah, what living being could have resisted that wondrous 
ass? To see it was to be overpowered; I for my part could not 
withstand the temptation to caress it. She must, we advised that 
adorable child, to obtain the predictions she was so eager to know, 
cooperate in the consultation; the auguries supposed certain sacri- 
fices. 

“You shall be whipped, my angel,” Durand notified her; 
“submitted, what is more, to a personage who will take his pleasure 
with you in every imaginable manner.” 

“Heaven! If ever my father were to—” 

‘‘He is severe, your father ?”’ 


1134 -& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘‘Jealous of me as of a mistress.” 

“So be it; but never shall he hear a word of what is about to 
come to pass: ’tis the Supreme Being who is going to visit you, dear 
girl, and the breaches sustained through your intercourse with him 
will be mended in the most magical way. This ceremony, I must add, 
is indispensable; unless you submit to it, farewell all hope of learn- 
ing what you wish to know.” 

And, my friends, be certain that I was mightily amused by 
the struggle I now saw being waged between modesty and curiosity. 
Rosina was of two minds; repelled by the prescribed tests, seduced 
by the prospect of instruction, she was at a loss what to do or what 
to say; and had it not been for the arrival of her father, we might 
well have spent the rest of the day enjoying her perplexity. But as 
the Senator was there, the shilly-shallying had to be brought to an 
end; Rosina finally decicled. While Durand remained with her, I 
went and joined her father. 

Powerful though Contarini’s feelings for his daughter as- 
suredly were, in a soul lixe his libertinage had an ascendancy over 
sentiment, and the Senator found himself capable of a few teasing 
gestures which were enough to persuade me that he would not take 
it ill were I to display my charms to his eyes. I complied; and from 
his caresses I soon reaciied conclusions touching his tastes. The 
- lewd rascal was passionately fond of the behind, and he was busy 
paying court to mine when we heard a tapping on the other side of 
the partition. 

“That is the signal, Excellency, get ready; the body of your 
charming daughter is about to be delivered to you.” 

A panel slides open and the lower five-sixths of the beautiful 
Rosina, that is, everything of her from toe to chin, arrives naked 
before us and at the disposition of the incestuous Senator. 

‘‘Ah, fuck!” he cries, feasting his eyes upon the treasure, “frig 
me, Juliette, frig me, I am going to die from pleasure examining 
such a wealth of charms.” 

I frig; the libertine explores. For a moment, everything before 
him appears to warrant his desiring; aye, he has kisses to bestow 
upon the cunt itself; but soon he is conquered by the ass. There is 
no imagining the ardor with which he embraces that part. 


Juliette & 1135 


“Frig from underneath,” he said to me, “while I lick the hole 
of this incomparable posterior.” 

His self-possession soon gone, his iron-hard prick lifts toward 
that vent, he embuggers. Rosina, little accustomed to such attacks, 
utters ringing screams; that libertine’s impetuosity is lessened not 
one whit, he pushes, he presses, he strikes bottom. The rake gropes 
for my buttocks; he would have my mouth glue itself to his, he 
would that with one of my hands I favor his assaults, that with the 
other I tickle his anus. 

“Libertine,” I ask, obeying his instructions, “is your intention 
then to confine yourself to that? are you not going to aim a thrust 
into this pretty little bush ?” 

“No,” the loyal sodomite replies, ‘‘no, I am not the man for 
such an undertaking: it’s fifteen years since I last touched that for- 
bidden fruit, my abhorrence of it is of fifteen years’ standing; how- 
ever, I plan to whip.” 

So saying, he withdraws, seizes the withes I hand him, and 
falls to thrashing his daughter with such violence that the blood we 
needed for the operation was soon flowing down her thighs. 

“You find me cruel, my child,” Contarini said to me as he 
smote away, ‘but one’s passions are what they are; the more they 
are refined, the more dreadful are their excesses.” 

At that point, the desire to augment the pretty little wretch’s 
sufferings introduced abominable ideas into my head. 

‘You doubtless have designs regarding the future of your 
daughter,” I said. 

“Yes; they are to fuck her soundly, to flog her cruelly, to 
make this festival last three months, then to force her to take the 
veil.”” And the loveliest skin in the world was being covered with 
stripes during this dialogue. 

“In truth, Signor, I very much wonder whether that is the 
wisest course. However, once you have had your fill of her, the 
means for disposing of her will be supplied to you here, you will 
avoid having to pay her dowry to a convent.” 

“What is this you are saying, Juliette?” 

“Ah, there are a thousand different means to that end... . 
What! Is it possible? The idea of a venereal murder has never 
defiled your imagination?” 


1136 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


‘““A murder? Why, yes . . . once or twice . . . but, bless me, 
murder my daughter ?”’ And I saw the Senator’s prick twitch, its tip 
rise, rubicund and wrathful: proof positive that the mere allusion 
to the project was having an inflammatory effect upon his senses. 

“Juliette,” he went on, fervently kissing the marks left by 
his cruelty, ‘‘admit that it would be a horrible crime . . . an appalling 
act before which all Nature would shudder. .. .” 

“Perhaps; but you will enjoy it.” 

Then, to rouse the lecher to the final pitch of excitement, I 
reach for a silken cord, tug it. The light dims in the chamber 
where we are; I rap upon the partition; and the next moment, 
hidden machinery sets into motion and we have the entirety of 
Rosina before us. 

“Take a firm grip upon yourself,” I whisper to Contarini, 
“she is there, all of her. Proceed; but not a word from you.” 

The libertine lands upon his daughter, presses ecstatic kisses 
to her mouth, to her breasts, re-embuggers her, discharges. 

“Good lord! See what you have done,” I say; “I surrender 
her to you, and you throw your opportunity away. Let’s send her 
back, I shall do what I can to restore you to life while Durand 
draws up her horoscope.” 

I signaled again, the child was borne away; the panel slid 
shut, and in another rcom the resourceful Durand sold her to 
another buyer. Our trade included three or four regular clients 
exclusively interested in prostitutions of this sort, and we took care 
to provide them with what seemed likeliest to suit their needs. 

I moved heaven anc earth to rekindle a spark in our Senator; 
all my efforts came to nought. Contarini was one of those limited 
individuals unable to carry out criminal projects except in the 
throes of passion; my suggestion had been too strong for him, and 
now he asked to have his daughter back. I went at once to notify 
Durand; but she, in view of the piles of gold the delicious little 
thing was certain to earn, simply would not hear of parting with 
Rosina. Won over to her opinion, I quickly struck upon the solu- 
tion that would satisfy all concerned. 

“Excellency!” said 1, rushing into the room where the Senator 
was waiting, “Excellency!” said I, tears streaming from my eyes, 
“your unhappy daughter. . . . Alas, terrified by the predictions 


Juliette 2 1137 


contained.in her horoscope, she has just leapt from a window; she 
is no more, Excellency, she is dead.” 

Deeply grieved, Contarini followed me into my companion’s 
apartment; he was shown a disfigured body which in point of age 
and figure looked to be that of his daughter; and that was what the 
simpleton believed. He thought for a moment to threaten us with 
prosecution, but, quickly sobered when reminded of the likelihood 
of well-founded countercharges, he fell silent and went out weep- 
ing like a fool, leaving us in possession of his cherished and ador- 
able child, who, promptly seduced by us, soon turned into one of 
our most accomplished whores. 

Not long afterward a noble Venetian came to us to buy poison 
for a woman he had doted upon and whom he had married two 
years previously. The poor fellow was convinced she had cuckolded 
him. He was mistaken; his wife was a model of good behavior and 
restraint. I alone was responsible for his suspicions, I had manu- 
factured them from sheer spite. That woman displeased me; I 
decided to organize her downfall, I succeeded. She was envenomed 
by her aristocratic husband; you may imagine how I rejoiced at the 
deed. 

A little while later we had a request from a son who was eager 
to take the straight way with his father. Here, the question was 
one of an inheritance and of an impatient young man who was 
tired of waiting; for two thousand sequins we sold him the secret 
thanks to which he was his own master the next morning. 

You will, I know, render me the justice of believing that I was 
never so much engrossed by this whirl of activity as to neglect 
myself; rich enough to devote an enormous outlay to my pleasures, 
and to surrender my body to others through wantonness or 
sordidness alone, I bathed, carefree, in an ocean of horrors and 
impudicities. My tastes for theft and murder were given generous 
expression throughout; and once my perfidious imagination had 
conjectured a victim’s doom, seldom was there more than the brief- 
est interval between the intention and the deed. 

Such was the high level upon which I was pursuing my moral 
and physical disorders when one day from Zeno, Chancellor of the 
Republic, I received an invitation to come, along with mv two 
friends, to his house lying by the Brenta Canal. We spent an entire 


1138 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


day there, rioting amidst everything of the most piquant that 
lewdness can devise. Wearied after so much voluptuous revelry, 
we were enjoying a delicious supper when an eighteen-year-old girl, 
the loveliest of creatures, urgently requested an interview with 
Zeno. 

“What! Here, in this place, consecrated to my pleasures, and 
at this hour ?” 

“Your Grace,” said the servant, ‘she pushed past the gate- 
keeper, past the footman, she is in despair, she has rushed hither 
from Venice, she says that the matter is vital, that there is not an 
instant to lose.” 

“Have her enter,” said the Chancellor. ‘Oh, Juliette,” he 
went on, lowering his voice, “lest I am greatly mistaken, I believe 
an occasion is at hand to put my principles into practice.” 

The door opens, and the most beautiful girl I have ever seen 
falls weeping at the magistrate’s knees. 

“My Lord!” cries the lovely one in distress, ‘‘my father’s 
life is at stake. Arrested yesterday on charges of conspiracy, he 
whose brain has never entertained a seditious thought, he, abso- 
lutely innocent, goes to the scaffold tomorrow. To save him there is 
nobody but you; I beg you to intervene. If blood must flow, oh, my 
Lord, let it be mine rather than his, let me die in my father’s stead.” 

“‘Amiable child,” said Zeno, lifting the girl up and directing 
her to take a chair at his side, ‘‘are you not Virginia, the nobleman 
Grimani’s daughter ?” 

“Ty am.”’ 

“Signorina, I am acquainted with this affair; and however 
you may interpret it, I must assure you that your father is exceed- 
ingly guilty of treasonable plotting.” 

“No, my Lord.” 

“Guilty, I repeat. Be that as it may, all is not yet lost. . 
Juliette, come with me. I shall be yours in an instant, Virginia; I 
am going to prepare the document needed to save your father.” 

“Blessings be upon Your Grace!” 

“Be not overhasty with expressions of gratitude, my dear; 
this pardon has yet to be granted.” 

“What?” 


y 


Juliette & 1139 


“You shall be apprised of everything, Signorina, everything 
shall soon be in your hands; and you will be able to blame no one 
but yourself if you do not obtain what you ask.” 

We remove into a chamber nearby. 

“There,” said Zeno, ‘is a creature who arouses me to an 
uncommon degree; Venice boasts of no more beautiful girl; I must 
have her, have her at any price. Save her father, however, that I 
cannot do, and even if I could, I am convinced, Juliette, that I 
would not. I am going to write two letters; in one, I shall request 
his pardon; his prompt execution in the other. And I shall see to it 
that she carries the second back with her, although supposing it is 
the first. Persuaded that in her hands she has the instrument to 
rescue her father, Virginia will grant me what I ask of her. But 
when she discovers that I have deceived her... ah, Juliette, there’s 
the rub.” 

“Is it necessary, to send her back at all ?” 

““Grimani’s daughter ... Venice, the entire Republic—” 

‘‘She must be denounced.” 

‘‘But I cannot both accuse her and enjoy her. Once she stood 
before a court, why, it would all come out: it would be my ruin.” 

‘Zeno, your accusations are secret, your tribunals obscure, 
your executions nocturnal: promise this girl that you are pardon- 
ing her father; send her off, as you said you meant to do, with the 
note that will put the noose around his neck; accuse her im- 
mediately afterward: I assure you that my women and I will act 
as your witnesses. These little horrors are my depraved heart’s 
delights; certify that this girl came here with no design other than 
to seduce you, we will bear out your contention; dismiss as cal- 
umnies, recriminations, whatever she invents for her defense; fee 
well the lawyer who shall be given her for the sake of form; let 
the preliminary hearings be conducted promptly and perfectly in 
camera; and inside twenty-four hours, if that is what you want, she 
will be out of the way.” 

“You are right,” said he. “As for the letters, there they are. 
Oh, Juliette, I foresee an enjoyable experience. What a charming 
girl you are !”” 

He returned to the company. “Signorina,” said Zeno, “I be- 


1140 qd THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


lieve this should be sufficient: read this paper. However,” he went 
on, “such favors, as I presume you realize, are not granted for 
nothing.” 

“Oh, good my Lord, all we have is yours for the asking, I am 
under instructions from my family to accede to whatever your 
requests may be.” 

“They are not for money,” said the Chancellor, “what I 
demand is more precious: your charms, Virginia, must be aban- 
doned to me. I want no other reward, but I shall not forego that 
one: and this letter shall not leave my hands until I have obtained 
what I ask for.”’ 

““Great God, what a sacrifice! O thou whom I love,” said she, 
drawing from her bosom a locket containing the portrait of her 
intended, “why must I be placed between infidelity and infamy! 
Your Grace, would it not be a noble thing, to content yourself with 
the happiness of saving an innocent man’s life—” 

“Impossible. And you have not an eternity to make up your 
mind; I give you one minute. Your father’s crimes are such that it 
were better for you to take rapid advantage of my charity.” 

And, leaving her to meditate her decision, Zeno moved into 
a neighboring boudoir w.th Lila to prepare himself for the infamies 
that were animating him. I nodded to Rosalba, whose powers of 
penetration were showing new signs of development with every 
passing day; and, height of wickedness, we, Rosalba and I, fell to 
preaching to the girl. 

“Ah, beware, Signorina,” Rosalba warned her, drawing her a 
little to one side and employing a confiding tone, “do not trust that 
libertine; he is capable of anything who is capable of demanding 
your honor in exchange for your father’s life. Once he has had his 
way with you he will play you false; and who is to say whether, to 
cover up his crime, the monster will not immolate you upon the 
still-palpitating remains of the worthy author of your existence? 
But, supposing that he does abide by his word, how will your 
fiancé view this sacrifice? It is of the species which love is little 
inclined to overlook, and you must consider it a certainty that he 
will never pardon you; [ tell you, beware of all the snares being 
set for you. You are undone if you weaken. .. .” 


Juliette - 1141 


At this point I address Virginia in my turn, pretending not to 
have heard the drift of Rosalba’s speech to her. 

“Signorina,” say I, “only too well do I know that at your age 
nice scruples and fine feelings are the gods to which one fancies it 
one’s duty to devote oneself. This stubborn constancy you main- 
tain toward your lover, ought it, I ask you, to outweigh all the 
filial sentiments owing to your father? Zeno, the most upright of 
men, is incapable of deceit; remember, besides, that it is not your 
heart he solicits, but merely your body. Ceding it to him, you will 
remain no less pure in your lover’s eyes. 

‘Ah, believe me, lovely Virginia, in the situation where cir- 
cumstances place you, it would be sinful to refuse. Will you coolly 
watch your father walk to his death when an instant’s complacency 
on your part could save him? And, Virginia, there is this too: are 
you sure that the fidelity to which you would sacrifice everything is 
being as religiously observed by your lover as by you? and are you 
yet unfamiliar with the way of all flesh? Were it to happen, now, 
that the man you love had less than your share of virtue, think of 
how bitterly you would repent having immolated your father to an 
unrequited sentiment! No, Signortna, you cannot disdain the pro- 
posal that has been made to you, you cannot, I repeat, without 
guilt; the modesty you are going to set aside is a virtue created by 
convention, whereas the filial piety you would outrage by not 
yielding, that, my dear, is Nature’s true sentiment, the authentic 
and priceless sentiment you cannot stifle without perishing from 
grief.” 

Fancy, if you will, my friends, the anguished perplexity that 
such words were able to produce in this timorous and sorely beset 
soul; so upset was she in her mind that her moral forces were near 
to deserting her. Zeno’s return occurred at that point, and he 
arrived in such a state of indecency that there could be no further 
doubt, his unhappy victim was lost. The rascal had a towering 
erection, and Lila, naked, led him in by the end of his prick. 

“Well, has she reached her decision?” he stammered. 

‘Yes, my Lord,” I replied, “yes, indeed, this young lady is 
too reasonable not to feel that she owes much more to her father 
than to her alleged virtue, and she is prepared to lay it by here and 
now.” 


1142 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“No, no,” cried the poor girl, tears springing to her eyes, “I 
would rather die. .. .” 

But, seizing her without further ado, we, my women and I, 
stripped off her clothes and in two minutes, despite her struggles, 
her nudity stood revealed to the Chancellor’s impure gaze. 

Dear God! what forms! what skin! what rosy freshness! Not 
Flora herself could have matched those charms. Zeno admired 
them avidly, and each cf his multitude of lewd kisses seemed to 
coincide with the discovery of a new wonder. We offered the ass to 
him: great heaven! what: allurements, what firmness, what rotund- 
ity ! and when we pried it open, when to Zeno’s eyes we exposed the 
cunning little aperture, object of his desires, we thought him about 
to expire of pleasure as he fucked it with his tongue. 

“Let us see how she looks when aroused,” said the Chancellor; 
“Juliette, and you, Rosalba, tickle the sensitive parts of her body; 
watching you at work, I am going to have myself worked upon by 
Lila, and as you progressively inflame this damsel, my mouth, 
straying over her charms, will verify the glow of pleasure in them.” 

I was not sorry to be entrusted with this chore, for, ever since 
my first glimpse of that celestial creature, I had been fairly dying 
to frig her. We attacked so skillfully, my companion and I, that 
lust soon began to gleam in Virginia’s beautiful eyes; and the 
pretty rascal, trembling ecstatically in our arms, summons Zeno’s 
prick to the destruction of her maidenhead. Lila brings the 
Chancellor’s engine up to the gate; the libertine thrusts; as he is 
lightly weaponed, and as Virginia has been exhaling whey in 
abundance and now discharges afresh, all difficulties vanish, there 
he is, master of the fort; I alone am holding the victim, frigging 
her at the same time; as for Lila, crouching atop Virginia, she 
presents her handsome posterior to the lecher’s kisses; and Rosalba 
flogs him. 

He was rushing toward the crisis when I checked him, a hairs- 
breadth short of it. 

“You cannot afford a thoughtless expenditure of munitions,” I 
reminded him, “do not forget that another stronghold awaits 
storming.” 

“True,” he conceded, retreating. 


Juliette &% 1143 


And, in a flash, to his lewd covetings we swung around the 
most divine ass Nature had fashioned since the creation of Gany- 
mede’s. Zeno contemplated it. 

‘“Buggerblast me!” said he. ‘‘What a treasure mine eyes do 
behold!” But rather than amuse himself bestowing further praise, 
the scoundrel, profiting from the help we provided him, soon forced 
the barriers. Virginia, through the position I had made her assume, 
lay upon my face and I sucked her cunt while the Chancellor 
sodomized her; my friends were frigging, handling, ministering 
to Zeno. Everything enfolded him in pleasure, everything hastened 
the escape of the fuck which he soon shot to the depths of the 
world’s most beautiful ass, despite the outcries, the writhings of 
the victim, who had not endured this assault as patiently as the 
other. 

‘What a fucking I have had,” said he as he drew forth his 
member. “Oh, Juliette, save only for yours, no ass on earth can 
produce such a sensation; I am still in its grip—” 

“Come, my friend, let us dispatch that letter.” 

‘For a certainty,” the monster replied to me, “I have just 
acquired, from fucking this girl, all sorts of reasons to condemn 
her father. However,” he added in a subdued voice, “however, 
Juliette, I do not intend to limit myself to that piece of mischief.” 

Then lower: 

“T shall not stop there, Juliette. I would like my wickedness to 
dazzle you, my dear, and for-the means necessary to further 
fuckery I count upon the episode about to follow.” 

‘Do you mean to allow its object to remain alive for long ?” 

“Why,” said Zeno, “I believe that if I were to add a little 
postscript to the letter, the authorities would come here to my 
palace to arrest her; and as between now and then I shall have 
achieved a fresh erection, perhaps I shall be in her ass at the 
moment they arrive to take her away to death.” 

‘You are to be congratulated upon the idea,” I say to Zeno, 
“act upon it quickly.” 

The appropriate lines are annexed to the missive, the courier 
departs for the city, and we return to our lewd play. From the 
manner in which I saw Zeno caressing Virginia’s buttocks it was 


1144 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


easy to tell that he was inwardly scheming against that splendid 
behind. There is no imagining the atrocities an ass inspires, when 
one has enjoyed it thoroughly. 

‘‘Ah ha! you want to whip it, do you? You want to tear that 
magnificent ass to shreds, my friend; and you hesitate to do so? 
To work, Lord Chancellor,” I say, “satisfy yourself; in my pocket 
I have a lotion which, applied to the stripes, will efface all sign of 
them in three minutes. And if, as proof of what she has suffered, 
the baggage wishes to show the marks, the evidence will contra- 
dict her, and everything else she has to say will that much more 
surely have the sound o* calumny.” 

“Juliette,” Zeno.exclaimed, ‘“‘you are delightful, I shall never 
cease to proclaim your merits.” 

Thereupon, listening now to nothing but the voice of his 
passion, the villain has us hold Virginia and, swearing like one of 
the damned, with barely one hundred strokes he transforms a peer- 
less behind into mincemeat. He starts in upon the second hundred, 
and I take his prick into my mouth; my two women flog him while 
he flogs Virginia; and soon his prick begins to lift, and when ’tis 
up, and hard, he hurls himself like a madman upon the girl, 
sodomizes her, and disc.aarges shrieking. 

“Oh, Juliette!” he declares once he has finished, ‘“‘what a 
shame I cannot myself immolate this slut, what pleasure it would 
give me to kill her! With her profound sensitivity she would be 
responsive to every tor:ure we could invent, the one more divine 
than the other. Think, to flay that bosom! to burn those buttocks! 
Juliette, Juliette! I wou'd like to roast her heart on her belly, then 
eat it upon her face.” 

When I drew forth my lotion and prepared to anoint Virginia’s 
wounds, Zeno stayed my hand. “No,” the monster said to me, 
“leave my marks upon her, I want her to wear them to the scaffold, 
I want her to have the possibility of exhibiting them, I want her to 
dare not do so; the idea strikes me as droll. .. .’ And with horrid 
remarks and cruel jibes we slew and slew again all hope in the 
poor girl, sporting with her thus till the sbirri were there. 

For Zeno’s fatal letters had succeeded but too well; Grimani’s 
daughter was placed under arrest. 

‘Just Heaven!” the wretch cried upon perceiving the effects 


Juliette & 1145 


of the Chancellor’s traitorous maneuvers; ‘“‘you deceived me, vil- 
lain, but my judges will hear me and I shall be revenged for your 
horrors.” 

“Do your duty, gentlemen,” the phlegmatic Zeno said to the 
officers, seeming to ignore the imprecations being addressed to him, | 
“take this girl away; grief appears to have addled her brain. 

‘Has action been taken,” the monster went on to ask, “upon 
my recommendations that the culprits be put promptly to death?” 

“Your Worship,” said one of the policemen, drawing forth 
two bloody objects from underneath his cloak, ‘“‘here is how your 
orders were executed.” 

And Virginia sinks to the floor in a swoon, having recognized 
the severed heads of her father and her beloved. 

Zeno turned to me with a smile. ‘‘Quite a scene, is it not?” he 
whispered. “It is restiffening my prick, I will have you note. Let us 
obtain privacy so that we can devote ourselves to further horrors.” 

“By all means. Keep the heads, Sire, and send those myrmidons 
away.” 

“Very good, gentlemen,” said the Chancellor, ‘that will do: 
Virginia will be in a Venetian dungeon within two hours. Leave 
these relics here, and return to your other duties.” 

“One moment,” I murmured to Zeno, “‘the fellow who brought 
the heads, would he be the trusty who performed the decapita- 
tions ?” 

“Ves.” 

“If that be so, then there is a refinement to outrage we can 
ill afford to neglect. Unhandsome as he is, and his hands still 
steeped in gore, the man who just beheaded the girl’s father and 
her lover must now fuck her, so it would seem to me.” 

“Decidedly,” said Zeno; “there are delicious things to be 
done in life, one must be careful to omit none of them.” 

One of the sbirri leaves, Zene enclosets himself with the other, 
with Virginia, with the two heads, with the three women, and with 
me. We give our attentions to the victim, mindful to place the 
heads before her so that, upon opening her eyes, they be the first 
objects she sees. To the headsman is appointed the task of sum- 
moning the girl back to life, and upon recovering her senses, they 
are the grisly vestiges of her dear ones she beholds, ’tis in the arms

of her executioner she finds herself. I was frigging that ill-favored 
man while he was ministering to Virginia. 

“Fuck this attractive girl,” the Chancellor said to him. 

“Your Grace!” 

‘“°Tis an order; you assassinated the father, continue at 
present, fuck the daughter; you killed the lover, I want you to 
fuck the mistress now.” 

Smitten by these words as though by a thunderbolt, Virginia 
sinks back again upon my breast, nearly unconscious. 

“Softly, softly,” I say to Zeno, “since, unfortunately, this is 
to be your last discharge, it ought at least to be complete, and we 
should use every means at our disposal to make it brilliant.” 

Put in charge of affairs, herein as follows was the voluptuous 
grouping I adopted. The sbirro slides underneath Virginia, encunts 
her, opens and presents the sublime creature’s buttocks to Zeno, 
who embuggers her; one in each hand, Virginia holds the severed 
heads in place upon the executioner’s chest, I give him my cunt to 
suck, turning my behind toward Virginia; Zeno frigs, to right and 
to left, my two friends’ asses; a charwoman flogs him. Before that 
onslaught of delightful sensations, the lewd Chancellor could not 
be expected to hold out forever; by and by, he discharges; we all 
do the same; Virginia is borne out inert from this scene of horrors. 

We leave. The Chancellor in person conveys his victim to the 
prisons of the Palace of Justice; and twenty-four hours later, 
thanks to our depositions, Virginia’s sentence is handed down. That 
was the moment we were waiting for. By dint of gold and seduc- 
tions, Zeno arranges to have another girl take her place at the 
block; and Virginia returns into our clutches. We ourselves act the 
part of her executioners, a substitution whence she derives no 
benefit. God! what a scene it was! the thought of it had me seeping 
for a week afterward; [ can recall few infamies which wrought 
upon me as that one did. 

Women, in the meantime, continued to arrive in droves at 
our house; some to have their fortunes told, the others, in security 
and secret, to wallow in the rarest and most extreme forms of 
libertine misconduct. Owing to measures we had taken, we were in 
a position to furnish our female clientele with boys and girls, and 
that under conditions of inviolable clandestinity. We also provided 


Juliette & 1147 


everything needed by youthful couples who, embarrassed by the 
obstructions created by parents, were grateful to take shelter with 
us. Other matches were made in obscurely lit apartments, where 
the men were unable to recognize the women we supplied to them. 
To how many fathers did we thus contrive to give their daughters; 
to how many brothers, their sisters; to how many priests, their 
penitents | 

There came to me one day two women, of twenty and twenty- 
five, both charming, and who, having both taken a fancy to me, 
besought me to direct their games and in them to play a third. We 
all three had supper together; their mania consisted in sucking my 
mouth and my cunt. They proceeded by rapid shifts, in such a way 
that she who had just cunt-tongued me now tongued my mouth, and 
she who had been kissing my mouth moved instantly to my cunt. 
During this luxurious to-and-fro my role was to frig them simul- 
taneously and uninterruptedly, one with either hand, and after 
that, fitted with a dildo, to fuck them in turn; while she who was 
not being fucked was having herself tongued by her who was; 
exceedingly lubricious they were, that pair. There is no imagining 
the things they invented, the things they said in the course of their 
lewd antics. One of them, I recollect, was so carried away that she 
was moved to go and have herself fucked by the inmates of a 
hospital full of syphilitics. 

Welcome, you who will now explain to me the workings of the 
imagination in persons of my sex; for my part, it is beyond me. In 
general, those two libertines were as lively, as clever, as amiable as 
they come: my own belief is that Nature is infinitely more lavish in 
her favors to tribades than to other women, and that just as she 
accords them a richer, more flexible imagination, so she has pro- 
vided them with superior means for experiencing pleasure and 
bestowing delight.° 

Another adventure which you will insist upon hearing was the 


5 These charming creatures, of whom fools are wont to have a low opinion, bring 
to society the same qualities they demonstrate in pleasure: they are always more 
original, more intelligent, more agreeable than others; almost all of them have graces, 
talents, imagination: why therefore hold against them a failing for which only Nature 
is responsible? Clumsy, dull-witted devotees of ordinary pleasures, you censure them 
only because they reject your advances; but if one pauses to analyze the women who 
appreciate you, they will always be found to be almost as stupid as yourselves. 


1148 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


extraordinary outing I made in the company of four Venetian 
ladies. 

They waited for a stormy day, then arrived to fetch me in a 
gondola at a moment when flashes of lightning were flickering 
across the sky. We headed a certain distance out to sea; the storm 
broke; claps of thunder filled the air. 

“This is the instant come,” said the rascals, “let us frig one 
another; and let it be with streams of sperm we hurl our defiance 
at the tempest.” 

And the sluts spring upon me like a quartet of Messalinas. 
Bless me, I reply in kind: too sensitive to pleasure to be chilled by 
such everyday natural phenomena, I[ join them in blaspheming the 
chimerical God who, it is said, produces them. Meanwhile, 
the thunder rumbles, lightning leaps in all directions. Caught in the 
rising swell, our gondola is tossed about like a cork; and we swear, 
we discharge, we brave alarmed Nature, risen in wrath against all 
existing things, and respectful of our pleasures alone. 

Another very pretty woman sent to request me to come to 
lunch at her palace. I was obliged, while she surveyed the proceed- 
ings, to pollute her fifteen-year-old son; after that, we frigged each 
other in his presence. She had her daughter called down, who was 
one year younger. She ordered me to excite that maiden, while she 
had her son embugger her; next, she herself held her daughter 
before the youth’s sodomite attacks. While that was going forward, 
I was cunt-sucking the daughter and the mother was exciting, 
lingually, the asshole of the young lady’s fucker. Never had I met 
with a more cold-bloodedly libertine nor more composed intelli- 
gence. The moment she learned that we traded in poisons, she 
purchased a complete store of them. I asked her whether she 
planned to employ any with the pretty objects we had lately 
enjoyed. 

‘Why not?” she answered. “When I indulge in these infamies, 
I never restrict their scope.” 

“Delicious creature,” I responded, kissing her upon the 
mouth, “‘the more restraints one thrusts aside in these cases, the 
more one discharges.” 

“Then I shall discharge plentifully, 
riers are things I ignore.” 


” she observed, ‘“‘for bar- 


Juliette & 1149 


Six months later she was husbandless, fatherless, motherless, 
without children. 

A member of the Council of Ten sent for me, needing a woman 
to serve his son’s pleasures while he himself embuggered that son. 

Another, belonging to the same Chamber, required that I frig 
myself with his sister, who was old and ugly. He embuggered that 
sister; after which, he did the same to me; then I received one 
hundred lashes from that sister’s hand. 

In brief, there was no species of venereous activity, of de- 
bauchery, of infamy to which Durand and I did not dedicate our- 
selves from morn to night; and not a day passed but our fourfold 
trade of whore, procuress, fortune-teller, and poisoner brought in 
a thousand sequins, and often much more. 

Supported, applauded, sought after by all the most amiable 
libertines, male and female, in the city of Venice, we were, without 
the slightest doubt, leading the most delightful and the most 
lucrative of lives when a dreadful reversal disrupted our partner- 
ship, deprived me of my beloved Durand, and caused me the loss, 
in the space of a day, of all the sums I had brought to Venice for 
investment, and all those I had earned there. 

In the punishment it meted out to Durand, fate expressed an 
intolerance of the same weakness for which I myself had been 
made to pay many years before. My fault, leading to my enforced 
departure from Paris, had been a reluctance to carry crime to its 
ultimate degree. The same misfortune befell Durand; and such 
cruel lessons could only reinforce her conviction, and mine, that 
the most dangerous course, when you are in crime’s train, is to face 
about in a virtuous direction, or to lack the boldness necessary to 
pass the final frontiers; for my friend’s failure was indeed one of 
courage rather than of will; and if the unhappy creature suffered 
defeat, twas not through default of ambition, but through that of 
nerve. 

The three State Inquisitors had, one morning, summoned 
Durand before them; and after having sworn her to absolute 
secrecy, they divulged their need of her destructive assistance for 
the purpose of annihilating a numerous faction which had formed 
inside the city. 

“Unfortunately, affairs have got beyond the point,” they ad- 


1150 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


vised her, ‘‘where legal means can be employed; poison is the only 
One remaining to us. You have, as you know, benefited from our 
indulgence during the three years you have been in Venice, we have 
allowed you to enjoy the fruits of your crimes in perfect tranquillity ; 
today, as token of your gratitude, we expect you to tend yourself 
in an advisory capacity or as an executant to crimes similar to those 
which our duty might otherwise have required us to punish most 
severely. Would you be able to disseminate the plague through a 
town and at the same tire preserve from its ravages such persons 
as will be indicated to you?” 

“No,” said Durand, although she did in fact possess both the 
required secrets; she possessed them, but she was afraid. 

‘Very well,” said the magistrates. A door was opened and she 
was dismissed. 

And what added to her fright was the fact that they had not 
even bothered to warn her to keep silent. 

She returned straight to the house. “We are lost,” she told 
me the moment she entered. Thereupon she related everything that 
had just taken place. My first thought was to send her back at once 
to see the Inquisitors. 

“It would change nothing,” she replied. “Carrying out the 
work, I would lose my life just the same; they would do away with 
me secretly. No, the only thing for me to do is leave you this very 
minute; for if they discover or suspect that we have seen each 
other, you shall be compromised.” 

The poor thing made ready to go. “Farewell, Juliette, 
she, ‘“‘adieu. We may pehaps never meet again.” 

Not two hours after my friend had departed officers appeared 
at my door with a warrant from the Republic. I am escorted to the 
Palace; I am led, deeply disturbed, to a remote, very isolated room 
in one of the uppermost stories. My guards form close ranks about 
me. A wide black taffeta curtain divided the room. Two Inquisitors 
appear; the police leave. 

“Stand up,” one of the Inquisitors says to me, “and give clear 
and precise answer. Have you known a woman named Durand?” 

“Ves,” 

‘‘Have you committed crimes jointly with her ?” 


“No ” 


” said 


Juliette %& 1151 


“Did she in your hearing ever speak ill of the government of 
Venice?” 

“Never.” 

The other judge now spoke up, his voice was grave. “Juliette, 
your replies are calculated to deceive; you tell us less than we 
already know; you are guilty.” He paused for a moment, then drew 
the black curtain aside. Behind it, hanging from the ceiling, was the 
body of a woman at which I no sooner looked than I averted my 
gaze in horror. “There is your accomplice; and that is the manner 
in which the Republic punishes cheats and poisoners. Get you gone 
from its territories inside twenty-four hours, else you will meet 
with the same fate tomorrow.” 

My head swam, I lost consciousness. 

When I returned to my senses I was in the hands of an un- 
known woman and still surrounded by police officers. I was dragged 
out of that room. 

‘Now go home,” the chief of the sbirri advised me, “comply 
scrupulously, punctually, with the orders of the Republic. Refrain 
from obstructing the task of the bailiff who will confiscate your 
holdings and chattels, that is to say, the funds you have in Venetian 
banks, your household furniture, and your personal jewelry. Leave 
with the rest, otherwise you die if sunrise finds you still in the city.” 

“I shall obey, good sir,” I replied, “I shall obey, I have no 
wish to remain any longer in a town where they punish people for 
having declined to do evil.” 

“Silence, Madame, silence; were anyone else to hear such 
remarks, you would not leave this palace alive.” 

‘My thanks to you, my good man,” I said to that turnkey, 
dropping one hundred sequins in his palm, “I understand your 
advice and I appreciate it; when tomorrow comes I shall be far 
away from your melancholy swamplands and lagoons.” 

My packing was accomplished in no time. Lila and Rosalba 
appeared to wish to stay in Venice, where they were earning a 
comfortable living ; I left them there; with me I took only one 
woman, who had been at my side ever since my marriage and of 
whom I have not spoken hitherto because she never played any role 
in my adventures. Having permission to keep my pocketbook and 
my cash, I set out with a little more than eight hundred thousand 


1152 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


francs; everything else was seized by the Republic; but still intact 
were my Roman investments, from which I had dividends of five 
million a year, and that helped cheer me up. That night I reached 
Padua; less than a week later, Lyon, where I halted for a few days’ 
rest. During my northward journey I had not once paused to dally, 
and that little fast had drought on a violent need for fucking; to 
satisfy it, I betook mysclf most naturally to the house of a cele- 
brated bawd whose address I had been given, and who in the course 
of the fortnight I spent with her, furnished me with everything I 
could possibly wish for in the one and the other sex. 


Considering no risk entailed in a return to Paris, since the 
Minister from whom | had fled was no longer among the living, I 
decided to proceed thither once I received a reply from Noirceuil, 
to whom I penned a letter describing my intended move. Delighted 
at the prospect of seeing me again, that stout and cherished friend 
assured me that it was with the greatest pleasure he looked forward 
to a sight of me and of the progress his outstanding pupil had made. 
I dispatched another letter to Abbé Chabert, asking him to bring 
my daughter to Paris, and I named the hotel at which I planned to 
stop. We all converged there at almost the same moment. Marianne 
was entering her seventh year. No child could have been prettier 
than she; but Nature was mute in me, libertinage had extinguished 
its voice. Such then are its effects; taking a soul in its tyrant’s grip, 
it is loath, so it would seem, to allow room there to any sentiment 
other than those it inspires, and if in its despite some other con- 
trives to penetrate, it is able to corrupt it at once and turn it to its 
advantage. I am obliged to say that in embracing Marianne I felt 
absolutely nothing stir in me but the pulsations of lubricity. 

‘‘There’s a pretty subject for educating,” I murmured to 
Chabert; ‘oh! I am eager to preserve this creature from the errors 
that drove her mother f-om Paris, and from those that brought 
about the downfall of Durand in Venice. I shall make her so aware 
of the necessity for crime that she will never stray out of its path, 
and if ever virtue strives to worm its way into her heart, I want it 
to discover vice so firmly entrenched there as to have not even the 
chance to launch an attacx.”’ 


Juliette & 1153 


Chabert, who had presided over Marianne’s upbringing, was 
pleased to have me admire all her little talents; she played the 
piano, she danced charmingly, drew prettily . . . spoke Italian, etc. 

‘“‘And the animal temperament?” I asked the Abbe. 

‘‘Animal enough, I believe,” Chabert replied, ‘‘and if we do 
not watch our step, the little minx will be frigging herself fairly 
soon.” 

‘Why, I shall aid her,” said I, “I shall be overjoyed to gather 
the first indications of her nubility.” 

“Wait just a bit,” the Abbé advised me, ‘else you may en- 
danger her health.” 

This consideration, however, attected me barely at all. The 
Abbe, who had come to Paris several times during my absence, 
informed me of the most recent developments and took charge of 
the transfer of my funds from Rome. I soon acquired two fine 
town houses, as well as the country estate you are familiar with. 

The day after arriving I went to find Noirceuil; he welcomed 
me with every sign of happiness, and declared that in his opinion I 
was more beautiful than ever. Having continued to profit from 
the Minister’s favor up until the time of his death, Noirceuil, while 
I had been away, had tripled his fortune, and all Paris looked upon 
him as one of the foremost men of the day. 

“Juliette,” he assured me, “‘be certain that I shall never take 
a step upward without enabling you to rise alongside me; you are 
indispensable to my existence; I like committing crimes with no- 
body but you, and delicious excesses await us if we succeed in 
obtaining a still greater amount of influence than the very consider- 
able amount of it I enjoy already: it shall therefore be necessary 
for us to combine our efforts in order to exploit this vein.” 

After that he invited me to recount my adventures; and when 
I came to the five hundred thousand francs I had promised to turn 
over to Fontange de Donis, being brought up in a convent at 
Chaillot, and who must then have been seventeen years old, he 
urged that we amuse ourselves with the girl and pocket the half- 
million. His arguments touching this matter were so compelling 
that I cannot resist repeating them to you; I should interject that 
I deliberately adopted a hesitating attitude, which incited him to 
reason more forcefully and at greater length than he might other- 


1154 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


wise have done. Here then is how he combated my simulated ob- 
jections, one evening when we were supping together in his little 
house at Barriere-Blanche. 

‘“‘When one has two reasons for doing a thing, Juliette,” said 
he, “and none for not doing it, I confess to you that I am inclined 
to disbelieve my ears when I hear the question raised of whether 
it should be done. When one is thirty years old, when one has 
intelligence, no prejudices, no more religion, no more God, no 
remorse, the most thorough habit of crime, much to gain from 
doing that thing, I confess to you, once again, that it strikes me as 
passing strange to hear it asked whether that thing is to be done 
or not. Once one has ready to hand everything required to operate, 
once one has already accomplished greater and more difficult things 
by far, once one has found pleasure in doing them, once one has 
been thrilled by that pleasure, I frankly confess to you, when over 
and above the same dose of pleasure the thing offers still greater 
advantages, then it sounds very peculiar indeed to hear one debate, 
shall I succumb to the temptation? shall I not succumb to it? You 
merit the whip, my dear Juliette, yes, the whip, for daring to consult 
me upon any such futile affair as this; I therefore declare to you 
that if four days hence it has not been attended to, executed, done, 
I shall break off all dealings with you, and regard you as one of 
those insipid, characterless women who spend their lives fidgeting 
without ever achieving anything. Are you going to allege that you 
are rich enough to dispense with a sum upon which the welfare 
of an unhappy orphan may depend? Ah, Juliette! does one ever 
have enough money? Granted, as spent by you, this half-million 
will go merely for superduities: I ask you whether the enjoyment 
of these superfluities would not, from your point of view, be pre- 
ferable to the vain pleasure of renouncing them for the sake of a 
little girl with whom you have no acquaintance, and whom, through 
this gift, you would furthermore be robbing of the only pleasures 
to which you ought to submit her. 

“Let us, if you like, glance inquiringly at the existence of this 
little girl—for, oh yes! it is not so devoid of importance as to be 
undeserving of investigation. What is she to you? Nothing. Who 
is she? The bastard engendered by a woman with whom you had 
libertine traffic. Very respectable titles! But, one moment now: 


Juliette & 1155 


what will happen if you fulfill the prescribed commission ? Nobody 
in the wide world will congratulate you; they will simply say you 
performed your duty. If, on the other hand, you keep the sum, 
never will anybody know it was given you in trust to hold for 
another, and you will have the delicious pleasure of enjoying it: 
say, the more attractive in your eyes, is it this empty and pointless 
duty, or the happiness you will procure for yourself with the sum? 
Oh, Juliette! can you waver for an instant? I shall go farther; I 
myself have never seen this girl, but you, look carefully at her, 
tell me whether upon her brow it is not written: ’T1s for thy little 
pleasures Heaven placed me in this world; consider all the irresist- 
ible fatalities which have led our paths to cross, and see whether it 
is not a victim Nature offers thee in my person. Yes, that is the 
legend writ upon her brow, you shall read it there; and whose hand 
but Nature’s could have inscribed it? But, you may perhaps reply, 
tis to hurt the interests of a friend; I behaved badly with her, all 
the more reason why I should make up for it now. There are, 
here, two things to be proven: that you are not hurting your friend’s 
interests, and that there is not the slightest wrong in thwarting a 
dead person’s intentions, whatever the idiotic respect fools have 
always had for such things. In what way, to begin with, will you be 
deceiving your friend? Her pure and simple intention was that 
this sum go to her daughter; but no clause denies you the right to 
benefit from it beforehand. Thus, hold on to the money with the 
intention of bequeathing the sum to her when you are gone, if she 
outlives you, and there’s your conscience at rest, if matters are 
such that you feel the need to placate it. What would be a violation 
of your friend’s wishes, would be to leave this property to a third 
person; but when you put it profitably to use with the idea of 
leaving it behind you, those wishes, certainly, are perfectly carried 
out. Madame Donis did not say to you, keep this child out of 
danger’s way, I recommend her life to your protection, and if by 
ill chance she dies, the funds will be yours, but yours only under 
those circumstances; no, not at all, she merely said: here are five 
hundred thousand francs, I am leaving them to my daughter. Well! 
if this child survives you, let the money become hers, and the dead 
mother’s desires shall be satisfied. 

“But there is more: were you, I must now point out, even 


1156 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


were you to violate this dead woman’s intentions, would you not 
simply be declining to act like a fool? for how do you suppose one 
can possibly feel obliged to honor the instructions of someone who 
has departed out of the world? To fail an individual while he is 
alive is to cause him hurt, because his passive existence sustains 
injury and suffers from your refusal to obey him; but once this 
existence has ceased, it cannot feel pain anymore, no more pain can 
there be; the shock is nullified, there being no one there to endure 
it; it is therefore perfectly impossible to offend a dead person; 
whence it results that every heir who to his own detriment executes 
a will for no other purpose than to cocker a corpse is as thorough 
an imbecile as the man who throws his money out the window; for 
the latter sacrifices his raoney, and the former sacrifices his hap- 
piness to the satisfaction of a nonexistent being, and according to 
my belief, between the one piece of madness and the other there is 
not much to choose. The world is full of many such benign little 
institutions of which peovle are loath to get rid, but which are not 
for all that any the less ridiculous. The clauses contained in testa- 
ments should none of them be executed, for it is absurd to think to 
be bound by them; absurd to think to endow a man with the faculty 
of action when he is deac,, ’tis contrary to every law of Nature and 
of good sense: and there’s an end to the question. Retaining the 
five hundred thousand francs, you in no wise counter your departed 
friend’s intentions ; I have, I think, demonstrated it sufficiently well. 
Let us now examine another branch of your dilemma: if I surrender 
the money, I secure this Jittle girl’s well-being; whereas if I do not 
surrender it, I secure my own. To this the following reply may be 
made. 

“We are able, it seems to me, to estimate the qualities in others 
only through the intimate relationships they have with us: some- 
one’s features correspond, fit in nicely with ours, only then do we 
have a motive for liking him; we are charmed by his face, his mind, 
his character, his attitude, all that affords us pleasure, and to 
frequent this object is for us a real delight. But when between two 
delights only one can be had, common sense dictates, there is no 
question about it, that the choice be for the better. Such is your 
position: either you must enjoy Fontange, at the expense of the 


Juliette % 1157 


tive hundred thousand francs, or you must enjoy the five hundred 
thousand francs at the expense of Fontange. Here, there is no need 
for me to offer you any advice; you alone can choose which enjoy- 
ment suits you best. Compare, deliberate, and simply remember that 
whatever decision you come to, you will inevitably feel some mis- 
givings, for virtue provokes remorse just as does crime. Con- 
sequently, if you abandon Fontange and keep the money, you will 
be saying to yourself, why did I choose this course? I regret that 
pretty creature. If it is the opposite course you elect, it will be, 
how weak I am! I would have enjoyed five hundred thousand francs, 
and today I am obliged to make shift without them. Observe, how- 
ever, that the former of these regrets is necessarily counterbal- 
anced by a real consolation, a physical consolation. True, you will 
say to yourself, I have lost Fontange, but I have enjoyment; 
whereas for the latter the only compensation is an isolated, transi- 
tory pleasure, an insipid sacrifice to virtue whence you will never 
derive merit, a small inner satisfaction, an intellectual pleasure in 
itself very mediocre and apt at all times to be troubled by the other 
regret. The one involves a privation of slight importance, while 
ensuring much and delightful material happiness; the other, a very 
substantial privation and a little mental thrill. Your way of thinking, 
besides, is incompatible with such pitiful little moral delights ; it is 
not when one believes in nothing, it is not when one detests virtue 
and adores vice, it is not when one loves crime for its own sake 
or for the advantages it yields, that one can be interested for long 
in virtuous pleasure. Simply compare that with the charms of 
enjoying your five hundred thousand francs, and you will sense 
the difference at once. The main object, you say, is to avoid remorse. 
If that be so, then, immediately and unhesitatingly, commit the 
crime you are projecting; for I say unto you, that if you do not 
commit it, you shall no sooner have denied yourself the possibility 
of committing it than you shall be devoured by chagrin at having 
let go by such a splendid opportunity to appropriate this money. 
For you, crime is not what it is for others. You have attained the 
point where you find the very keenest excitement in crime, it affords 
you the extremest voluptuous pleasure; therefore doubt not that 
this pleasure, which you will, in this case, enjoy all the more, there 


1158 ee THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


being no further restraints to cast off; doubt not, I say, that this 
pleasure entirely offsets the little pangs and qualms by which 
anybody else might have: been afflicted, undertaking this deed. 

“And so I see for you, in the case of the crime done, enjoyment 
firstly, in the doing of it, a further enjoyment, subsequently, for 
having done it; and in the other case, I see nought but a decided 
privation, a privation whence you will suffer not once, but con- 
tinually and increasingly, as with every day your caprices become 
more numerous, and every day demand further resources to be 
satisfied; and by way of compensation, I see nothing but the solitary 
feeling, a feeling that for everybody is temporary and dilute, that 
is entirely frivolous for you, of having accomplished not a good 
deed, but an exceedingly ordinary one. For I might perhaps excuse 
you for doing it were it in any sense what they call heroic, since 
. that would at least mean some satisfaction for your pride; but no, 
instead I see no pleasure whatsoever accruing to you. Your deed 
is not great, it is not glorious; it is merely common. You accomplish 
no good through ensuring Fontange’s enjoyment of the money, and 
you do yourself a very preat disservice by not preventing it. But 
that would suppose, you say, getting rid of this little girl in order 
that she never find out I have robbed her. Well indeed! once you 
have no difficulty conceiving of murders committed for lewdness’ 
sake, it seems to me that it should be just as easy for you to con- 
ceive of those warranted by material considerations. Both sorts 
are inspired by Nature; both have the same aim, and proceed from 
the same passions. You commit lust-murder to put yourself in a 
proper frame of mind for sensual pleasure; you commit all kinds 
of other murders for the identical purpose of satisfying a passion. 
Between this murder and that murder there is not a particle of 
difference: any difference you were to try to establish between them 
would be frivolous; only the motives behind them permit dis- 
tinguishing one murder from the next. Now, assuredly, Juliette, 
it is far more legitimate to commit the misdeed prompted by a 
powerful interest than merely for the sake of an agreeable ejacula- 
tion. You are quite prepared to murder for mental stimulation, for 
your imagination’s comfort, and yet you dare not do it when a 
fortune is at stake! 


Juliette 1159 


“From the foregoing two sets of alternatives emerge: first, 
if the transports Fontange procures you are greater than those 
you can expect from her property, the right course is to preserve 
Fontange, find a husband for her, and enjoy the milksop pleasure of 
having done your duty, of having done well with respect to Fon- 
tange, but very ill with respect to yourself: for, make no mistake 
about it, to perform a good deed is one thing, but to deprive one- 
self of a bad deed is something else, and it cannot be taken so 
lightly. There are perhaps times when some small amount of merit 
may attach to the performance of a kindly act; none ever exists in 
denying oneself the pleasure of performing a wicked one; because 
the former shines in the eye of the public, the latter does not. The 
second set of alternatives is this: if the pleasures you may expect 
from this supplement of fortune are to you of greater moment than 
Fontange’s well-being, you must waste no time getting rid of her: 
for you cannot enjoy both these happinesses, and you must per- 
force sacrifice the lesser, the weaker of the two. 

‘Let us now determine what kind of sentiment you owe to 
Madame Donis. . . . None, so far as I can see. Sensual pleasure 
brought you together, crime separated you. Were she yet alive, 
you would certainly owe her nothing; dead, she is obviously entitled 
to still less. "T'would be absurd, extravagant to continue to have 
any feelings whatever for a person who can no longer benefit from 
them; to this person’s shades, neither respect nor consideration, 
neither love nor remembrance is owing; he can be allowed no place 
in your imagination, because his presence there could not be any- 
thing but disagreeable, and you know that it is included among our 
principles never to permit any ideas to enter the mind save pleasant 
or voluptuous ones. Well, this train of ideas points smoothly, and 
logically, toward mistreatment of the daughter, since ’twas out of 
lust you killed the mother; these ideas would be disrupted, would 
inevitably be spoiled if you were now to go and render the daughter 
a service. Hence, not only is there no disadvantage in your refusing 
to be helpful to the girl in any way, but it is even necessary to your 
pleasure that you render her exceedingly unhappy. The idea en- 
gendered by the unhappiness into which you are about to plunge 
her will renew those of the atrocities you wrought against the rest 


1160 & THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


of the family; and from the interweaving and combining of all 
these ideas there shall necessarily result for you a voluptuous whole, 
certain to be disintegrated by contrary behavior on your part. 

“Do not allege to me the tender feelings for Madame Donis 
that inhabited you once upon a time. It would be absurd to re- 
awaken them; not only because you have damaged them through 
your crime, but because one must take good care not to preserve the 
least tender feeling for someone who exists no longer; it would 
be to wear out the heart’s faculties needlessly, and to impair the 
effectiveness of its action upon more real objects; nothing should 
be of less concern to us than a person deprived of life. Thus, as 
regards Madame Donis you are in a position where you have 
every right to offend her, since you owe her nothing, and where, 
offending her, you offend nobody, since she exists no more; and so, I 
repeat to you, it would be the most dreadful folly for you to 
hesitate. But, do you tell me, you hear an inner voice which seems 
to be urging you to resist; you ask me whether this is the voice of 
Nature? No, Juliette, no; this voice, about whose source you cannot 
conceivably be in error, is no other than that of prejudice: if it 
still sways you, lay it up to weakness, and to the fact that the 
criminal deed involved here is less familiar to you than those you 
ordinarily indulge in, even though it amounts to nothing else than 
the theft you are fond of and commit day in and day out. Here, 
it is most certainly the voice of prejudice you are hearing, instead 
of that of Nature, for when Nature speaks, her urgings are in- 
variably to seek happiness, no matter at whose expense. Therefore 
let it be the most critical kind of audition you accord that voice, 
sift the chaff out of its message, you will then hear it in all its 
purity, and ceasing to driit anxiously, buffeted by doubts, you will 


6 It is, of course, at this poinm: that we should examine the revolting absurdity of 
weeping over the dead. Sooner than lament, one should rejoice; for by perishing, this 
dear one you loved obtained his deliverance from all life’s tribulations. Furthermore, 
our grief, our tears can be of no use to him, and they affect us unpleasantly. The same 
applies to burial ceremonies, and to the respect one might still have for the deceased: 
useless, superstitious, all of it. To a cadaver one owes nothing other than to deposit it 
in good soil, where it can germinzte at once, swiftly metamorphose into worm, house- 
fly, or vegetable, which is difficult in cemeteries. If one wishes to render a last service 
to a dead man, then place him at the foot of a fruit tree, or in some fertile meadow; 
that is all you owe him, all the rest is absurd. (Touching this matter, see the remarks 
on p. 959.) 


Juliette & 1161 


then act in confidence and peace, without any fear of outraging 
Nature whom, to the contrary, you will be serving when you accom- 
plish the crime that you know she would have you commit, who 
assures you pleasure from committing it. 

“Thus, what I would do, were I in your place, would be to 
amuse myself thoroughly with this girl, to rob her, and then to 
put her in such a damnable plight that you could at any moment 
add further height to your happiness by feeding it upon the charms 
of seeing her languish; which, from the standpoint of voluptuous 
pleasure, is preferable to killing her. The’ felicity I recommend to 
you will be infinitely keener; beyond the physical happiness acquired 
from enjoyment, there will be the intellectual happiness born of 
the comparison between her fate and yours; for happiness consists 
more in comparisons of this sort than in actual physical enjoyments. 
It is a thousand times sweeter to say to oneself, casting an eye upon 
unhappy souls, J am not such as they, and therefore I am their 
better, than merely to say, Joy is unto me, but my joy is mine amidst 
people who are just as happy as I. It is others’ hardships which 
cause us to experience our enjoyments to the full; surrounded by 
persons whose happiness is equal to ours, we would never know 
contentment or ease: that is why they say, and very wisely indeed, 
that, to be happy, you ought never look upward, but always at those 
who are below you. If then ’tis the spectacle of the luckless who 
must necessarily complete our happiness by the comparison they 
furnish between themselves and us, one must take care not to 
relieve such downtrodden as exist; for by raising them, through 
this aid, from the class which provides elements for your compari- 
sons, you deprive yourself of these comparisons, and henee of that 
which improves your pleasures. However, simply to limit oneself 
to withholding aid from the needy in order to preserve this class 
useful for the comparisons whence the best portion of your happi- 
ness derives, that is not enough; you must neglect no opportunity 
to generate misery, both in order to increase the size of this class 
generally, and in order, particularly, to create a sector of it which, 
your own personal handiwork, sharpens the delights that are going 
to result for you from the comparisons it will provide. Thus, in the 
present instance, your complete pleasure would consist in making 
away with this girl’s inheritance, in then reducing her to beggardom, 


1162 > THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


in constraining her as it were to come begging at your gate, where 
you would cruelly refuse her the pittance she asks; thus, by drawing 
the spectacle of misery into your immediate vicinity, improve your 
enjoyment through comparison as intimate and at the same time 
as advantageous to you as possible, since all the woe confronting 
you is of your unique fzbrication. That is what my advice to you 
would be, Juliette, that is what I would do if I were you. ... I would 
have a daily erection thinking about these delicious ideas, standing 
before the still more divine spectacle of the distress I would have 
caused; and in the midst of these rare pleasures, I would exclaim, 
Yes, there she is; by means of a crime I got possession of her; and 
this inheritance I havz usurped, I spend upon pleasures so 
sweet that nothing I do is not crime; I am, through my behavior 
toward her, nothing but criminal, I am perpetually in a state of 
crime; not one of my pieasures is untainted by it. ... And with 
an imagination like yours, Juliette, oh! how heavenly such a.com- 
plication must be!” 

Noirceuil was very hot by the time he reached the end of his 
digression, and as since my return we had still done nothing to- 
gether, we now moved straight to a sofa. Lying there in his arms, 
I admitted that at no moment had I been visited by doubts con- 
cerning the fate of little ’ontange, and that what I had said to him 
had been said only in order to give him the occasion to expound his 
doctrines. I promised hira the young girl, assuring him that, how- 
ever interesting she might be, we would not fail to establish her in 
a quagmire of grinding poverty, after having wrung all we wanted 
from her. 

‘Well, well, Juliette,” said Noirceuil, fondling and kissing 
my buttocks, “if you depraved yourself in the course of your 
travels, J was not idle during the same period either; and you have 
returned to find me a thousand times worse than I used to be; 
there is not a single horror I have not accomplished since we last 
saw each other. Will you believe it? I am responsible for the death 
of Saint-Fond; I aspired to his post, I missed getting it; but 
nothing will prevent me from succeeding the man occupying it at 
present; his doom is a matter of time only, the machinery is in 
place; and once I hold office, which I ambition for what it will put 


Juliette 1163 


in my hands, to wit, all the power of the idiot prince and all the 
wealth of his kingdom, then, oh, Juliette, the mountain of pleasures 
that shall be ours! Crime, such is my wish, must stamp every 
instant of my career; you will not weaken with me as you did with 
Saint-Fond, and together we shall go far.” 

By and by I had to present my ass to that maniac; but he 
withdrew from it without leaving any fuck behind him. 

“I am waiting for someone,” he explained. “Allow me to 
inform you: she is a very attractive creature of about twenty-five, 
whose husband I have had jailed: this in order to get possession of 
the wife. If she opens her mouth, he can be put to death tomorrow; 
but as she adores him, I think she will keep silent. She also has a 
child, whom she idolizes; my aim is to induce her to forsake the lot; 
I propose to fuck the wife, have the husband broken on the wheel, 
and send the child to the workhouse. I have been preparing the 
operation for two months; up until now, the young woman’s love 
and virtue have held out admirably. You shall see how pretty she 
is. I should like you to help me seduce her. What has occurred is as 
follows. 

“A murder was committed in her house; she was there when 
it happened, along with the victim, her husband, and another man. 
Her testimony is crucial; the other man has deposed against the 
husband, but this woman’s evidence is needed, and the case cannot 
progress until she gives it.” 

“Rascal! this entire intrigue smacks of your confection: you 
had the man killed by the witness whom you seduced and who has 
sworn ’twas the husband did the deed; you want the wife to cor- 
roborate the thing, both for the pleasure of making her yours and 
for that other pleasure, more piquant still, of turning her into her 
husband’s assassin.” 

“Quite right, Juliette, how well you know me! All that is my 
doing. But I am eager to round out my crime, and I count upon 
you. Ah, my dear, it’s a voluptuous discharge I see ahead of me 
when this evening I shall fuck that woman.” 

She arrived. Madame de Valrose was indeed one of the 
prettiest creatures you could hope to see: petite, but exquisitely 
shaped, well fleshed, with a dazzling fair skin, the world’s loveliest 
eyes, breasts, and an ass that made the mouth water.

“Good evening to you, Madame,” said Noirceuil, “you have 
reached your decision ?” 

‘Good Lord,” that charming woman replied, her eyes filling 
with tears, “how can you expect me to agree to such a horrible 
thing?” 

“Take care, Madame,” I broke in sharply; ‘Monsieur de 
Noirceuil, having acquainted me with your business, has authorized 
me to offer you a word of advice. Bear in mind that as matters now 
stand, your husband is doomed, for to that end but a single witness 
is required, and one exists, as you are aware.” 

“But he is guiltless, Madame; the witness who accuses him is 
the murderer himself.” 

“You shall never convince your judges of it. This witness had 
no relations whatever with the dead man, but your husband had a 
good many. Therefore, I repeat, you should consider your husband 
as done for, incontestably. When, in the light of this terrible cer- 
tainty, Monsieur de Neirceuil, whose influence you know to be 
great, offers to save him if you agree to testify against him, I for 
my part—” 

“But what purpose does it serve, this testimony, since Mon- 
sieur is eager to save my husband?” 

“Without that testimony he cannot do it; it will enable him 
to show irregular procedure, and that slander doubtless exists, 
if not perjury, once the accused’s wife testifies against him.” 

“Then shall I not be punished ?” 

“A convent ... whence we will have you out again in a week’s 
time. Madame, that you are able to hesitate is more than I can 
understand.” 

“But my husband will believe that I sought to undo him, he 
will blame me in his heart; and in mine this idea shall weigh forever. 
It shall lie between us everlastingly: I save my husband only by 
creating an undying distrust which means eternal estrangement, 
which means—” 

‘Agreed, but is that not better than sending him to the gal- 
lows? And if you truly love him, should you not grant his life 
greater importance than the possession of his affections? If he 
dies, will you not also be separated forever ?” 


Juliette & 1165 


“Terrible alternative! And if I am being deceived . . . if this 
avowal seals his doom instead of saving him ?”’ 

“This injurious suspicion,” said Noirceuil, “is my reward for 
wishing to be of help to you, Madame, and I thank you.” 

‘Why, yes, Madame,” I put in heatedly, ‘“Monsieur de Noir- 
ceuil ought by all rights to drop your case this very minute; how 
dare you cast such aspersions upon the most virtuous of mortals?” 

‘For the aid he proposes he has set a price that dishonors me. 
I worship my husband, never have I broken faith with him, never, 
and it is not when he is beset by cruel troubles that I need crown 
his misfortune with such a woeful outrage.” 

“This outrage is imaginary: your husband will never learn 
of it. Manifestly, you are an intelligent person: how then, I 
wonder, can you cling to these illusions? It is not, moreover, your 
heart Monsieur de Noirceuil is seeking, but simply your favors, 
which should greatly reduce the hurt in your eyes. But, I shall 
further add, even were this hurt to exist, even were it grave, of 
what account can it be when your husband’s life hangs in the 
balance? 

“By way of conclusion I may say a word in defense of the 
price Monsieur de Noirceuil asks. Ah, Madame, you are” ill- 
acquainted with the spirit of the age if you fancy that kindnesses 
are accorded for nothing nowadays. Actually, in return for a service 
which your entire fortune would not begin to pay for, Monsieur 
de Noirceuil, by demanding nothing beyond a little forbearance 
on your part, is willing to accept exceedingly little, it seems to me. 
In short, your husband’s life is in your hands; it is saved if you 
accuse him, lost if you do not. There is your dilemma: Speak.” 

And at that point the dear little woman was seized by a dread- 
ful fit of sobbing which so aroused Noirceuil that the scoundrel had 
out his member and gave it to me to frig before Madame de Val- 
rose’s very eyes. She fainted. 

“Quickly there, buggerblast me!” said Noirceuil, “pull up her 
skirts, let me fuck her.” 

Her pretty bosom having been brought into view when I un- 
laced her stays, Noirceuil was soon kneading and mauling her in 
that barbaric manner with which he is wont to caress breasts. I fin- 


1166 <2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ished undressing the poor creature; she was still unconscious when 
I took her upon my lap, exposing that pretty ass to the libertine 
who, while I tugged at his pubic hairs, readied himself for his be- 
loved sodomy. Careless of his victim’s feelings, Noirceuil drove into 
the breach with such impetuosity that he soon summoned the little 
lady back to life. 

‘Where am I?” she gasped upon opening her eyes, “and what, 
good lord! is being done to me?” 

‘Have patience, my child,” I said in a rather chilly tone, 
won't be long before we have everything we want from you.” 

“But these things—”’ 

“Strange things which your husband never did, eh?” 

“Never, oh never! I shudder—”’ 

“Shudder away, but at the same time think a moment, Ma- 
dame,” said the ferocious Noirceuil, pursuing his embuggery, “it 
would require no more than to cut through the thinnest of partitions 
and the act you take exception to would be nullified; and so, if you 
like, Juliette, with a razo-—” 

“Fuck, Noirceuil, fuck, your mind is beginning to rove.” 

And the little woman, continuing to struggle: “Let go of me, 
let go! Tis a violence, an abomination—” 

“Why, God damn your soul!” Noirceuil roared, seizing a 
pistol and clapping the barrel to her temple, ‘‘any more disturbance 
from you, just one more word, and I blow your brains out.” 

’T was then the unhappy creature realized that resignation was 
her only course. Wearily, tearfully, she bends her head, lays it upon 
my breast, I pinch her belly, pull the hairs from her bush, cause her, 
in fine, such sharp pain that Noirceuil, locked in that trim little 
anus as though in a vice, senses the sperm rising in his balls. He 
catches hold of her breasts from underneath, wrenches them so 
cruelly, her pain becomes so extreme that the rake fairly screams 
as he discharges. He withdraws; and I, leaping upon that charming 
woman, I in my turn derive an excruciating pleasure from her. This 
scene revives Noirceuil; his prick rearisen, he comes forward to 
join us. Through the posi:ion | am in, my buttocks are accessible to 
him, he kisses them, and. inserting his prick in Madame de Val- 
rose’s mouth, orders her to suck it: her initial reaction is one of 
horror, her next impulse is to disobey. What a group! I was 


oe 


It 


Juliette & 1167 


sprawled atop Valrose; Noirceuil was lying upon me; he was warm- 
ing himself in that pretty little person’s mouth and was tonguing my 
ass. I poured fuck into my fricatrice’s cunt, Noirceuil loosed his 
into her mouth. Then we readjusted ourselves. 

“There we are,” said Noirceuil, his self-possession once re- 
turned, ‘“‘the infidelity has been committed; do you or do you not 
intend to save your husband ?” 

“Will he be saved by that, Monsieur?” was the charming 
creature’s question, asked in the mildest and sweetest voice; “are 
you very sure it will save him?” 

“I swear it by all that is holy,” the traitor declared, “and if 
I am mistaken, I am willing to forego all renewal of the pleasures 
I have just tasted with you. Be here tomorrow morning, we shall go 
to the judge together, you will sign a deposition affirming your hus- 
band’s guilt; I shall have him at your side the next day.” 

“Oh, Noirceuil,” I murmured to that monster, ‘how I admire 
this perseverance you are able to display in crime, even beyond the 
moment when the passions have subsided.” 

“Why, you saw me accomplish my act of pleasure,” Noirceuil 
replied; “‘you know, do you not, that my every expense of fuck is 
the signing of a death warrant?” 

We separated. Madame de Valrose, whom I conveyed to her 
home, besought me to take an interest in her case; and I promised 
that I would, with the sincerity one owes to a whore one has become 
tired of. The following day she made her deposition; and on the 
day after that Noirceuil arranged affairs so cleverly that the poor 
little thing was declared her husband’s accomplice, and hanged be- 
side him where he, after having been broken, lay exposed upon the 
wheel. We were, Noirceuil and I, watching from a window, I 
frigged him during the spectacle, he frigged me. Was my discharge 
agreeable? Not in ages had I enjoyed a better one. Compassion 
moved Noirceuil to ask for the custody of the child, he obtained it, 
he fucked it, and inside twenty-four hours had flung it into the 
streets, penniless and naked. 

“Far, far better that than to kill it,” he pointed out to me, 
“its sufferings will last longer, as shall my joy at being responsible 
for them.” 

Meanwhile, Abbé Chabert had found me everything I needed. 


1168 < THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


A week after having arrived in Paris I moved myself into a town 
house, you know what a delightful place it is; and I bought this 
property in the neighborhood of Essonnes, where we are for- 
gathered today; I invested the rest of my funds in various holdings, 
and when all my business was completed, estimated my income at 
roughly four million a year. Fontange’s five hundred thousand was 
spent furnishing my two houses, magnificently, I think you will 
agree. Next, I turned my attentions to libidinous arrangements; I 
assembled my several seraglios of women, in town and in country ; 
I hired thirty valets, all of them tall solid fellows, comely, chosen 
especially for size of member; and you know the service I get from 
them. I have, besides, six mackerels of my own in Paris, they pander 
exclusively to me, and when I am in the city I always spend three 
hours at one of their establishments, every day. Out here in the 
country, they send me what they find, and you have often been able 
to. verify the quality of their furnitures. With all that, I would ven- 
ture to suppose there are few women who can claim to lead a 
more delightful life; anc. yet, you know, I do not cease to want; I 
consider myself poor; ray desires are infinitely in excess of my 
possibilities; I would spend twice as much, if I had it; and I leave 
no stone unturned to increase my wealth, criminal or not, there is 
nothing I am unwilling to do for money. 

Once these divers arrangements had been made, I sent a ser- 
vant to bring Mademoiselle Fontange from Chaillot; everything 
owed for her keep was paid, and she was led out of her nunnery. 
Nothing in all the length and breadth of Nature could equal that 
girl’s beauty. Imagine Flora herself, and of Fontange’s graces and 
attractions you will still have a very imperfect idea. Seventeen years 
of age, Mademoiselle Donis was blonde; loosened, her superb 
tresses reached nearly to the floor; her eyes were a lovely brown, 
of incomparable liveliness, sparkling with love and voluptuousness 
at once; her delightful mouth never seemed to open save to heighten 
her beauty; and her faultless teeth resembled pearls set amidst 
roses. Naked, this heavenly creature could have served as model 
to the painter of the Graces. That richly rounded mons veneris! 
Those gloriously turned, infinitely inspiring thighs! That ass, that 
sublime ass! O Fontange! the cruelty it required, and the liber- 
tinage, not to spare such a host of charms, and not to exempt 


Juliette & 1169 


at least you from the rigorous fate I reserved for all my playthings. 

Five years before, when her mother had first talked to her 
about me, Fontange had been told that all possible respect and con- 
sideration were due me; upon learning who had sent the servant to 
fetch her away, she was overjoyed; and upon arriving, dazzled by 
this opulence, by this multitude of valets, by these magnificent fur- 
nishings, things which were all very new to her who had never until 
now been outside her convent, she blinked her eyes in disbelief, won- 
dering whether she had not been transported to an Olympus, borne 
above the clouds to some aerial dwelling place, habitat of gods: she 
may even have taken me for Venus. She sank down at my knees, I 
raised her up; I kissed her rosy mouth, her glistening eyes, her two 
cheeks so fair and which so quickly took Nature’s brightest crimson 
hue when touched by my lips. I hugged her to my breast and felt her 
little heart beat excitedly against mine, like that of a fledgling dove 
one has stolen from its nest. She was dressed with a degree of 
stylishness, albeit simply; from underneath a pretty flowered hat her 
superb blonde hair fell in curls to her two exquisitely shaped shoul- 
ders. When she spoke it was in a gentle tone, in a musical voice full 
of sweet mildness. 

‘““Madame, J thank a generous heaven for the privilege of be- 
ing able to devote my life to you. My mother is dead; in this world 
I have no one else but you.” 

As the words came forth her eyes grew moist, and I smiled. 

“Yes, my child,” I said to her, “‘your mother is dead; she was 
my friend; hers was an untimely, an unusual death . . . she left in 
my trust a certain amount of money for you. If you behave deserv- 
ingly toward me, you may be rich; but that will all depend upon 
your conduct, upon blind obedience to my will.” 

“I shall be your slave, Madame.” And she bent and kissed 
my hand. 

And I kissed her mouth again, rather more lingeringly this 
second time. I lifted her kerchief away, freed her bosom from its 
veils. She reddened; though unsteadied by agitation, nevertheless 
she continued, in measured and respectful terms, to sound the well- 
bred and decent young lady. Then for the third time I take her in 
my arms... her hair is a little disheveled, her lovely breasts are en- 
tirely bare; and, after fastening my mouth upon hers, “I believe,” 


1170 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


I say to her, “I believe I am going to love you, for you are young 
and pure and sweet.” 

The idea of shocking her occurred to me then: nothing is 
prettier than virtue scandalized by vice. I ring for my women; I 
have them undress me in the presence of this heavenly little girl; 
I gaze at myself in a looking glass. 

‘Tell me, Fontange,” I say, kissing her anew, “is it true that 
I have an attractive body ?” 

And the poor thing: averted her eyes; her face was scarlet. 
Around me I had four 0% my most beautiful women: Phryné, Lais, 
Aspasia, and Theodora; all four between sixteen and eighteen years 
of age; so many Aphrodites. 

“Come, Mademoiselle,’ Lais said to her, ‘“‘do not be back- 
ward. 'Tis a favor Madame is granting you; take advantage of it.” 

She advances, but with lowered eyes. I take her by the hand, 
draw her dowa upon my body. 

‘What a child she is,” I murmur to my women; “Phryné, show 
our babe in arms what shz is to do.” 

And Phryné sits dcwn beside me, takes my head upon her 
breast and, reaching a hand toward my cunt, begins to rub my 
clitoris. No woman acquits herself of that chore so well as she. Her 
execution is adroit, tutored, the play of her fingers lascivious, 
unerring; she kisses and caresses the behind in a singular manner; 
her tongue, when that is what I wish, tickles the anus marvelously ; 
her movements upon the mons veneris harmonize amazingly with 
what she is capable of doing in the other temple, which she sucks 
indescribably when called upon. While Phryné was in action; Lais, 
astride my chest, advanced her dear little cunt into position for 
sucking; Theodora was frigging my asshole, and the beautiful 
Aspasia maintained Fontange nearby the spectacle and her atten- 
tion fixed upon it, while frigging her to soothe her aching conscience. 

“Did you not use to do the same thing with your compan- 
ions?” Aspasia asked her. 

“Oh, never !”’ 

“Fiddlesticks,” said I from between Lais’ buttocks, ‘‘it’s 
nothing but masturbation in convents, I know it from experience. At 
your age I had already had my hands under everybody’s skirt.” 


Juliette & 1171 


Then, leaving the cunt I had been sucking: “Come here and kiss 
me,” I ordered Fontange. 

She approaches; I devour her. 

My women received instructions to undress her. And proceed- 
ings were temporarily interrupted while the clothing that was 
hindering my pleasures was removed, Fontange’s first, then every- 
one else’s. Ah, great God! how beautiful the child was when naked! 
what fairness of skin! what proportions! 

“Very well,” said I, “place her upon me, in such a way that I 
have this most winning of cunts above my lips. To you, Aspasia, 
will go the ass her position will be offering you: tongue her anus. 
Phryné, you shall frig her clitoris, seeing to it that all exhalations 
drain into my mouth. I am going to spread my legs; you, Theodora, 
between my thighs, shall cunt-suck me while, Lais, you shall be 
licking my asshole. Fair friends, pray put all your science to best 
purpose; use every trick you know, invent others, for this maid 
excites me exceedingly, and I wish to shed a sea of fuck on her 
account.” 

I need not describe to you all the pleasure I was to extract 
from this celestial scene; I went half-mad from joy. Lust did in due 
time assert itself in the young Fontange; she was unable to resist 
the voluptuous sensations vibrating throughout her being. Modesty 
gives way to raptures, and the novice discharges. Oh, how delicious 
is the first lowing of fuck! With what joy I fed upon that nectar! 

“Turn her over,” were the next instructions I issued to my 
women; “have her place her head between Theodora’s thighs, and 
suck her cunt; I in the meantime shall frig her ass with my tongue; 
Lais will do the same to me; I shall be fondling, stimulating an ass 
with each of my two hands.” 

Another ecstasy, another ejaculation on my part; it is more 
than I can bear, I seize Fontange, I leap upon her, I press my 
clitoris hard against hers, I rub frenziedly, I devour her mouth, my 
women tease my ass, spank it, thrash it, slip their hands underneath 
and worry my sex, in short, they overwhelm me with pleasure, and 
I loose what must be my tenth discharge, with my impure sperm 
drenching the delicious cunt of the prettiest and most virginal of 
girls. 


1172 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


The fuck gone forth, the illusion faded away. Beautiful as 
Fontange was, I now saw her with nought but that malign indiffer- 
ence which wakes cruelty in me when I am weary of objects, and 
soon her doom was spelled out in the depths of my heart. 

‘Put the clothes back on her,” I said to my women. 

I too got dressed; I sent the others out, we remained alone. 

‘‘Mademoiselle,” I said to her harshly, ‘‘augur nothing from 
a fleeting moment of inebriety into which Nature plunged me 
against my will; banish any thought that predilection might, on my 
part, have had something to do with it; I am fond of women in 
general; you satisfied me; there’s an end to it. You must now be 
informed that your moter gave me five hundred thousand francs 
for your dowry; it were simpler that you learn the fact from me 
than from some other source.” 

“Yes, Madame, I already know it.” 

‘Ah, Mademoiselle, you already know it; my congratulations 
to you. However, what you do not already know is that your good 
mother contracted a debt in this very same amount to a certain 
Monsieur de Noirceuil, to whom I of course transferred the sum, 
and who may bestow it upon you, if he chooses, or else keep it, for 
it belongs to him, both the money and the decision too. I shall take 
you tomorrow to see this gentleman, and urge you to behave with 
utmost obligingness should he happen to make any demands upon 
you.” 

‘‘Madame, the ethical and moral training which supplied the 
very basis of the excellert education I have been given—Madame, 
I wish to say that they are hardly consistent with your counsels.” 

“Nor with my actions, you may as well add, since you have 
taken it into your head tc scold me. Blame me even for my kindness 
to you, I advise you to do that also.” 

‘I am not saying that, Madame.” 

‘Well, do say it if you want to, for I assure you that your 
reproaches affect me as little as your praise: one frolics with a 
little girl like you, and when the game is over, one scorns her.” 

“Scorn, Madame! I thought that only vice was to be scorned.” 

“Vice amuses, virtue bores. And according to my belief, what- 
ever promotes our pleasures always deserves preference over that 


Juliette & 1173 


which gives nothing but headache and depressive vapors. . . . But 
you answer back, my fair one; you are tart, you are forward, you 
are insolent, and you are far from that degree of superiority which 
renders such failings excusable. An end to these discussions, 
Mademoiselle, if you please; the fact is that I owe you nothing; 
that with the half a million intended for you I paid a creditor to 
whom your mother was in debt; and that it lies with that creditor 
to decide whether to retain the sum or return it to you; and I warn 
you that he will keep it unless you show all kinds of consideration 
for him.” 

“What kinds of consideration, Madame?” 

“The same kinds I have just required from you; I should 
think you must understand what I mean.” 

“In that case, Madame, your Monsieur de Noirceuil shall 
keep everything. I am not the person to embark upon any such 
infamous career as this you propose to me; and if, out of respect 
for you, out of frailty or childishness, I was able a little while ago 
to forget what I have been taught to regard as my duty, so well 
have you opened my eyes that I have been punished for my fault.” 
And from those eyes, the most beautiful in all the world, there now 
gushed a flood of tears. 

“Indeed,” I said, ‘‘it is scarcely to be believed. We do not fall 
down at Mademoiselle’s knees, and lo! she makes a scene. My God, 
where would we libertines be if we had to perform curtsies and 
reverences before all the little harlots who frig us?” 

The word harlot was the signal for a veritable tempest; there 
was a banging of the head upon the table, there were shrieks of 
despair, there were tears scattered all about the room; and, if you 
wish to know the truth, ’twas not without the most trenchant 
pleasure I carried on my humiliations of the Fontange for whom I 
had been all afire a short moment before. Pride is salved by the 
illusion’s collapse; and from disdain for the idol one obtains an 
indemnity for all one spent when prostrate before it. That silly 
little goose irritated me to a point beyond description. 

“Look here, my child,” I said to her, “if Monsieur de Noir- 
ceuil does not give you your dowry, you will enter my service; it 
just so happens that I need a girl in the scullery, you can surely 
wash my pots and pans.” 


1174 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


And this brought forth tears in such abundance that I won- 
dered whether she was not going to suffocate. 

“On the other hand,” I continued, ‘‘if you dislike kitchens you 
can always go abegging or try whoring. Whoring, that’s what I 
believe I would suggest; your looks aren’t bad; and you have no 
idea what’s to be earned from frigging pricks.” 

‘‘Madame,” said Fontange, quite beside herself, “I am 
destined to neither of those trades. I wish to leave this house, 
kindly allow me to go. I repent the things I have done here, all my 
life I shall pray to be forgiven by the Supreme Being. . . . I intend 
to return to my convent.” 

“Do you? Your convent won't take you in. To live in convents 
costs money. You have none.” 

“T have friends there.” 

‘“‘No, you don’t, now that you are poor.” 

“T shall work.” 

“Come, come, little fool, calm yourself, dry your tears; my 
women will look after you this evening, tomorrow I shall take you 
to Noirceuil, and if you are mild in your manners you may not find 
him quite so harsh in his, nor as mischievous as I have been.” 

I ring, recommend the girl to the care of my tribades, have 
horses hitched to my carriage, and dy to Noirceuil’s house. He 
requests details; painting Fontange for him in none but truth’s 
colors, I could not fail to arouse him. 

“Here,” says he, trundling out a very rigid prick, ‘behold, 
Juliette, the effect of your descriptive abilities.” 

And bidding me accompany him into his boudoir, he engaged 
me to cooperate in several of those curious fantasies which rather 
double than extinguish th: effects of desire, which are not pleasure- 
takings but which, with libertine spirits like Noirceuil, outvalue all 
the licit conjunctions whether of hymen or of love. We were two 
hours at play, for I too am fond of those little horrors. I satisfy 
them for men with the same pleasure they take in submitting me to 
them ; their lubricity ignites mine; no sooner do I content them than 
I want them to content me in my turn; and after, as I say, several 
hours of foul frolicking, which cost us no loss of any kind, this, 
according to my recollection, was the declaration Noirceuil made 
to me: 


Juliette % 1175 


“It is a most extraordinary caprice I have been dwelling upon 
for a very long time, Juliette, and I have been awaiting your re- 
turn with impatience, having in all the world nobody but you with 
whom I could satisfy it. I should like to marry . . . I should like to 
get married, not once, but twice, and upon the same day: at ten 
o'clock in the morning, I wish, dressed as a woman, to wed a man; 
at noon, wearing masculine attire, I wish to take a bardash for my 
wife. There is still more . . . I wish to have a woman do the same 
as I; and what other woman but you could participate. in this 
fantasy? You, dressed as a man, must wed a tribade at the same 
ceremony at which I, guised as a woman, become the wife of a 
man; next, dressed as a woman, you will wed another tribade wear- 
ing masculine clothing, at the very moment I, having resumed my 
ordinary attire, go to the altar to become united in holy matrimony 
with a catamite disguised as a girl.” 

“Assuredly, good sir, this, as you yourself have said, is a 
curious caprice that has entered your head.” 

“Yes, but since Nero married Tigellinus as a woman and 
Sporus as a man, I am originating nothing except the celebration of 
the two unions in the space of a single day and, of course, the 
whimsical idea of having you imitate me; there is the matter of the 
ties which already subsist between ourselves and the objects which 
shall be utilized in this farce, and here I think we have greatly 
improved upon Nero. Your two wives are, firstly, Fontange who, 
clad in mannish garb, will become your husband; secondly, your 
daughter who, dressed in the customary raiments of her sex, will 
marry a Juliette in man’s clothing. My husband and my wife, who 
shall they be, do you wonder? They shall be two children, Juliette, 
yes, two children sired by me and of whose existence you have until 
now been unaware, of whose existence, indeed, nobody knows. One 
of them is nearing eighteen, he is to be my husband: a Hercules for 
vigor and looks. The other is twelve; ‘tis the incarnation of Eros. 
Both are the fruit of the most legitimate commerce; my first wife 
produced the elder, the younger was given me by the sixth. All told, 
I have had eight wives. That, I believe, you do know.” 

“But did you not tell me that you had no children left?” 

“These two have been dead to the world; both have been 
raised with great care, and in the strictest conformance with in- 


1176 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


structions, in one of my castles far off in Brittany. Neither one has 
ever seen the light of day. They have just been delivered to me here 
in town, they made the journey in a sealed coach. They are a pair of 
veritable savages, scarcely able to speak. But that is of little im- 
portance; properly guided, they will do very nicely for the cere- 
mony ; the rest is our affair.” 

“And appalling bacchanalia, I take it, are to succeed these 
unusual weddings ?” 

“Exactly.” 

“And Noirceuil, you wish to have my poor adorable little 
Marianne become one of the victims in these hideous orgies, is that 
it?” 

“No, she’ll not be a victim, but she will be present, my lust 
demands that. No harm will be done her, of that you may be 
perfectly certain: your women will entertain her while we are at 
work, thatisall....” 

Noirceuil obtains my agreement to everything. It will soon be 
seen how the villain kept his word. 

*Twas not immediately nor without difficulty that Mademoi- 
selle Donis succeeded in understanding the peculiar arrangement 
of the forthcoming scene : virtue regularly has trouble accommodat- 
ing itself to vice’s extravagances. Partly from fear, partly from 
eagerness to please, the unhappy girl did at last give her whole 
consent, but only after I had solemnly vowed that these scandalous 
weddings would conclude in nothing apt to alarm her modesty. The 
first ceremony took place in a small town lying two leagues from the 
magnificent castle Noirceuil owned outside Orléans, and in which 
the postmarital festival was to be celebrated; the second ceremony, 
in the chapel of that same castle. 

I shall not fatigue you with the details of those two rites; you 
will be content to know that everything transpired decently, punc- 
tually, and in strictest accordance with tradition; the religious 
ceremonies were followed by their civil counterparts, enacted in an 
equally dignified manner. There were wedding rings, there were 
Masses, benedictions, constituted dowries, witnesses; nothing was 
lacking. Costumes and paint artistically disguised the two sexes, 
embellished them where necessary. 

By two o'clock that: afternoon Noirceuil’s dual project had 


Juliette 2 1177 


been carried out: he had become the wife of one of his sons, the 
husband of the other, while I found myself the husband of my 
daughter and the wife of Fontanges. Everything completed, the 
gates to the castle were shut and barred. The weather being ex- 
ceedingly cold, great fires were lit in the superb hall where we were 
to forgather; and severest orders having been issued that the 
impending bacchanalia be interrupted under no circumstances, we 
closed ourselves up inside those baronial surroundings. In number 
we were twelve. 

We being the two heroes, Noirceuil and I sat upon a black 
velvet throne placed in the center of the hall; below the throne 
there were to be seen, all wearing crowns of cypress, the elder of 
Noirceuil’s two sons, named Phaon, eighteen years of age; the 
younger, aged twelve, whose name was Euphorbe; my daughter 
Marianne and Mademoiselle Donis; the two groomsmen at the 
weddings, agents of Noirceuil’s sodomite pleasures and his hired 
killers, one of whom was dubbed Desrues, the other Cartouche, 
each of some thirty years, both garbed as cannibals, with switches, 
daggers, and live snakes in their hands, both posted at our sides in 
the attitude of bodyguards; on the right of us as on the left, seated, 
were two of my tribades, Theodora and Phryné; at our feet, two 
whores, likewise naked, appeared to be awaiting our orders. These 
girls, simply picked out of a bawdyhouse, were a bare eighteen and 
twenty years of age, and both were of the most charming physi- 
ognomy : they were there as auxiliaries to the scene. 

Surveying these preparations, I felt just a little apprehensive 
for my precious Marianne and was moved to remind Noirceuil of 
the assurances he had given me. 

“‘My dear,” was his reply, “it ought to be plain to you that 
I am tremendously overwrought. Consider what it did to me this 
morning, to satisfy the incredible longing that had been preoccupy- 
ing me for years. It crazed my brain, Juliette, that’s what it did, 
and I fear you have chosen a bad moment to remind me of promises 
of good behavior: let a little added irritation set the nervous 
system ablaze, and you know as well as I that all such guarantees 
go up in smoke. Let us enjoy ourselves, Juliette, let us amuse our- 
selves; perhaps I shall abide by my word; but if I do not, in the 
lewd pleasures which shall soon see us gripped in ecstasy, strive to 


1178 <& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


find the strength to endure the misfortune you seem to dread—a 
misfortune which, between us two, is by no means as dreadful as 
they make out. Think, dear Juliette, that for libertines like us, the 
hand is stayed by nothing, nor is the mind; that, for us, an object’s 
ten thousand titles to inviolable respect are that many reasons to 
outrage it further: the more exigent virtue appears, the sooner it 
pleases furious vice to defile and degrade it.” 

One hundred candles lit that hall as the scene opened. 

“Cartouche, Desrues,”’ said Noirceuil to his two ministers, 
‘worthy emulators of the famous men whose names I permit you 
to bear; you who, like your patrons of whose high feats history 
shall transmit an indestructible record down to the last generations 
of mankind; you, I say, who have never failed to lend your arm to 
the noble and ennobling cause of crime, go undress the four destined 
to holocaust and whose brows are wreathed in the foliage of death’s 
tree, go strip them, and of their raiments, whereof there is no 
further need, make the employment I have prescribed to you.” 

The emissaries step forward; the four victims are despoiled 
of every article of clothing, which is flung piece by piece into the 
roaring blazes that warm the hall. 

‘What baneful ceremony is this?” asks Fontange, seeing the 
fire consume everything she has been wearing, her skirts, her petti- 
coats, even her shift; “why burn these garments ?” 

‘Dear girl,” Noirceuil replies, ‘‘a little earth, some sod, you 
shall soon need no more than that for cover.” 

“Good Lord! what do I hear! And what have I done to earn 
this ?” 

“Bring that creature to me,” Noirceuil says. 

And while Lais sucks him, while one of the whores toils over 
his ass, and while I excite him verbally, the libertine glues his 
mouth to the mouth of that enchanting girl, and pumps it an entire 
quarter of an hour despite Fontange’s resistance, which is keen but 
vain. Then, shifting his lewd attentions to her behind, “‘Oh, Juliette, 
she has an ass too! a beautiful ass,” he cries, working himself into 
an ecstasy before it; ‘‘’twill be delightful to fuck all that and to 
martyrize it... .” 

Therewith his tongue slips into the cunning little hole; mean- 
while, upon his orders, I with one hand pluck out the silky hairs 


Juliette -& 1179 


growing upon that lovely girl’s cunt and pinch her budding breasts 
with the other. He forces her upon her knees, bids his two men 
tongue her here and there, and ends with having her kiss his bum. 

These commencements were trying for the young thing, her 
shame and discomposure were extreme; if anything was more 
powerful than these two feelings, ’twas the terror inspired in her 
by the preparations for what, as best she could tell, seemed due to 
follow. Trained to modesty, having received none but the best 
principles in the house whence she came, Mademoiselle Donis 
was necessarily in an evil situation; and nothing amused us more 
than the fierce conflict raging between her sense of decency and her 
perception of iron necessity. There was one point at which she 
sought to elude the inevitable. 

‘Stop that squirming and stay just where you are,” Noirceuil 
told her harshly; ‘‘do you not realize how delicate the imagination 
is in a man like me? A mere nothing disturbs it, the instant service 
fails, everything breaks down, comes all to pieces; understand that 
the divinest charms are null unless presented to us submissively and 
with obedience.” 

And while he spoke the rascal was fondling the girl’s ass, ’twas 
over that angelic creature’s buttocks the impurest and most feroci- 
ous hands were wandering. ‘‘Bugger-fuck!”” he exclaimed, pursuing 
his palpations, “how unhappy I intend to make this little jade! 
Look at these charms, and tell me whether they do not cry out for 
horrors!” 

He then has her take hold of Cartouche’s prick, obliges her 
to frig it, savoring the sight of innocent hands accomplishing the 
chores of vice; and as the poor girl, all in tears, exhibits much 
disgust for the work but no skill, he orders one of the whores to 
give her lessons and compels the student to humbly thank her 
teacher. 

“Some abilities as a fricatrice may well stand her in good 
stead,” Noirceuil remarked; “the frightful state of misery to which 
I propose to reduce her shall oblige her to do something to stay 
alive.” 

He bade her tongue the two whores’ cunts; after that, to suck 
his prick; and enjoined the company to slap her hard upon the face 
whenever the slightest hint of repugnance could be read there. 


1180 «& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Very good,” said he, “let us give thought to hymeneal 
pleasures, we have devoted ourselves long enough to those of love.” 
Then, casting a murderous glance in Fontange’s direction: ‘Aye, 
well may she tremble,” said he, “‘and more than tremble in anticipa- 
tion of the moment when I return to busy myself with her again.” 

Lais and Theodora are dispatched toward Phaon, at once 
Noirceuil’s husband and his son; they soon succeed in erecting him, 
and lead the boy up to Noirceuil who, bent over me, nonchalantly 
presents his behind to tke chaste consort whom my tribades guide 
his way. I was frigging him from below and he was tonguing now 
the one whore’s asshole. now the other’s. 

“Have the customary ceremonies observed,” he says to 
Phaon’s conductresses, ‘‘rhis young bridegroom is not to make away 
with the favors offered to him until he has first shown himself 
worthy of them.” 

Phaon kneels, adopts a worshipful attitude before the ass 
facing him, kisses it respectfully, rises to his feet, and, yielding to 
the impulses being developed within him, the handsome youth runs 
his instrument hilt-high into his dear papa’s ass. Membered like a 
mule, his capers and heaves soon produce quivers of joy in the 
patient, and rakish Noirceuil falls to simulating the little shrieks, 
the smirks and smiles of the bride undergoing her defloration; he 
sighs, he moans, his contortions are amusing beyond words. The 
youth, perfectly excited by everything surrounding him, soon dis- 
charges into the entrails hugging him happily. When he has com- 
pleted his act he is obliged to reiterate the respectful gestures with 
which he began. Then he retires; but Noirceuil, very hot, wants 
fucking; his panting anus seems to be crying forth the need for 
pricks; Cartouche and Desrues sodomize him; while they do, he 
kisses the buttocks of Lais and of Theodora to which, he avows, he 
has taken a mighty fancy. Niched underneath him, I suck him with 
all my strength; and he fondles whore’s ass. Fucked twice by each 
of his men, Noirceuil is ready for new things. “Now we shall play 
the husband,” he announces; ‘‘after having acquitted myself so 
well in the wifely role.” 

Euphorbe, his second son, is brought to him. I am asked to 
pilot the engine; three lusty blows and the pucelage is no more. His 
weapon is still loaded when Noirceuil withdraws, and he comes 


Juliette & 1181 


forth with an ardent desire for Fontange. It is the whores who 
march her up to the line and who supervise the operation. 

“Juliette,” says Noirceuil, ‘‘oblige me by violently biting this 
little girl’s cunt while I embugger her. Since during my pleasure I 
would that she experience a maximum of pain, your instructions, 
Cartouche and Desrues, are to seize each of you one of her hands, 
and to remove her fingernails with the blade of a pocketknife.” 

Everything is put into execution. Fontange, stunned by this 
variety of simultaneous agonies, knows not whether it is her 
mutilated fingers which hurt her most, or the bites wherewith I 
lacerate her cunt, or the hammerings of the monstrous prick tearing 
her fundament. But ’tis, it seems, the embuggering which is creating 
the greatest difficulties for her ravaged frame; the titillations pro- 
voked in her behind appear to be nearly too much for her to endure. 
Her screams, her tears, her groans attain such a pitch of violence 
that Noirceuil, powerfully stirred by all he hears, teeters on the 
brink of crisis. He retreats from the breach. 

‘Oh, Juliette!” he cries, ‘‘what a delightful ass the slut 
possesses, and how I adore making her suffer. Would that I had all 
hell’s demons to help me bother her, each by means of an original 
and unheard-of torture.” 

He has her turned over and held by the harlots; I open and 
present her cunt to him; he plunges impetuously into it, while burn- 
ing sulphur is put before the wretched girl’s nostrils and her ears 
are shorn away. The maidenhead is blasted, blood flows, and 
Noirceuil, more aroused than ever, decunts, has the victim held 
aloft by his two trusties, and sets merrily to flogging her with 
martinets whose iron tips have been heated in the fire. He himself 
is whipped by the whores while he is acting, and he sprinkles kisses 
upon the asses of my tribades, whose buttocks are poised nearby on 
a level with his lips; I suck him and at the same time tickle his anus. 

‘“‘We are comfortable in here, are we not,” says Noirceuil a 
few minutes later; ‘the severe cold reigning outside gives me a 
splendid idea.” 

He wraps himself in a heavy fur mantle, has his two men 
and me don others, and we walk out of doors with a naked Fon- 
tange. In front of the chateau is a great marble basin now covered 
with ice; upon it Fontange is placed. Cartouche and Desrues, hold- 


1182 % THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


ing great horsewhips and large firecrackers, stand by the basin’s 
edge; Noirceuil, two or three paces back, watches, and I am at his 
side, frigging him. Foritange is told to skate six turns around the 
basin; when she strays too close to the edge, she is driven off by 
the whips; when she moves too far away, firecrackers are tossed at 
her, they explode about her head or between her legs. Tis a very 
gay spectacle, as the poor creature skids and slides this way and 
that, falling very frequently, each time all but breaking a leg. 

“What!” exclaims Noirceuil angrily, seeing that she is about 
to complete her sixth circuit without having met with serious 
accident, ‘‘what! the slut is to come through unscathed ?” 

But the next instant, to Noirceuil’s relief, an exploding fire- 
cracker blows one of her breasts away, she totters, fractures an 
arm as she falls. 

“That, by God, is a little better,” mutters Noirceuil. 

She is borne back into the castle, unconscious; there, she is 
given that minimum of attention required to restore her to useful- 
ness, her wounds are lightly bound up; and the stage is set for 
further scenes. 

Noirceuil demands. that my daughter frig me while he looks 
on; he avidly kisses the child’s pretty hinderparts while she is en- 
gaged at her task. 

‘That shall turn into a lovely ass, Juliette,” he says to me, “it 
already excites me enormously.” 

And though she was but seven years old, the wicked fellow 
prodded her tentatively with his gigantean prick; but, wheeling 
suddenly away from Marianne and toward his son Euphorbe, Noir- 
ceuil fits himself into that other fair young posterior, ordering me to 
crush the boy’s testicles. There is no pain to equal what the unhappy 
child experiences, simultaneously tormented before and behind. 
After a brief run in that charming ass Noirceuil withdraws and has 
the child lashed by his ministers. While one of them flogs, the other 
embuggers the sore-beset Euphorbe, whose virile parts, in con- 
formance with his father’s wishes, are lost to a razor-blade 
wielded by me, who shaves them clean off his belly. Noirceuil, 
managing to keep one eye on the operation, ardently kisses 
Theodora’s buttocks in the meantime. 

“Come now, Julietze,” he says to me, “have yourself fucked.” 


Juliette %& 1183 


In a fearful state, I wanted nothing else. The two cannibals 
laid hands on me; one darted into my cunt, the other lodged him- 
self in my ass; Noirceuil moved from the first to the next, em- 
buggering them by turns while the whores spurred him on with 
lashes. As soon as he sees my discharge terminated, Noirceuil calls 
for Fontange and surrenders her to the two executioners. 

‘Make free with her,” he tells them, “do whatever you like 
provided you torture her the while you fuck her.” 

The two rascals treated the girl so roughly that, in their arms, 
she swooned away once again. 

“One moment,” said Noirceuil, “I cannot resist sodomizing 
her anew.” ; 

And while he was satisfying himself I surprised him with an 
unexpected piece of cruelty: using a scalpel, I cut out my ward’s 
right eye. That horror overpowers Noirceuil: his patient’s reaction 
to the pain is so lively, her muscular contraction so sharp, that the 
libertine loses his seed ten inches inside the maid’s rectum, at a 
juncture where he is being sodomized himself and is girt round by 
display of ass. 

“Come along, my fair one,” he says to the bedraggled crea- 
ture; he grips her hard by the arm and drags her bodily into an 
adjoining chamber. I follow. 

“Behold,” says he, pointing to a table upon which lie, in gold 
coins, the five hundred thousand francs belonging to the poor girl, 
“that is your dowry; in order that you see that wealth, we have left 
you an eye, and it is our fond hope that the sight will prove an 
unhappy one: for that money is not to be yours. Slut, my intention 
is that you die of starvation; and I am going to treat you in such 
sort that you shall never be able to complain of your fate, although 
I am also going to set you at liberty. Here,” he went on, taking her 
by the wrist, ‘‘touch this gleaming stuff, tis gold, ’tis yours, and yet 
you shall never have it. Aye, buggeress, feel it, that is what I want 
you to do; and now that you have done it, you'll do nothing more 
with these useless organs.” So saying, he secures her hands upon a 
butcher’s block, embuggers her, and I cleave off her hands while he 
is operating; the blood is stanched, the stumps bandaged. . . . Im- 
mediately, fucking uninterruptedly, the barbarian orders his victim 
to open her mouth and stick forth her tongue: I seize it with tongs,

I sever it at the root; I gouge out the remaining eye. . . . Noirceuil 
discharges. 

“Good,” says he, withdrawing and dressing the girl in a shift 
of sackcloth, ‘‘we are now assured that she shall not write, that she 
shall be blind as a bat, that she shall say never a word to any soul 
that lives.” 

Weescort her to the gate and out upon the highroad. 

“Go seek your living,” says Noirceuil, giving her a ferocious 
kick, ‘‘your living, indeed! The thought of the fate that awaits you 
gives us greater cheer than we would derive from your assassina- 
tion; begone, slut, venture into the world and denounce your 
persecutors, if you can.” 

“Ah, but she will be able to grasp their questions if nothing 
else,”’ I pointed out, ‘ther hearing remains to her.” 

“Does it now ?” said the barbarous Noirceuil. ‘“Then we shall 
remedy that,” and he drove the point of a knife successively into 
each of her ears. 

We returned to the company. 

“Excite me, you rascals,” our libertine said to the four 
women; “I have just discharged, I must recover my forces. . . . 
Frig these men and let them fuck me; my need of horrors is never 
so great as when I have been lately committing them.” 

Noirceuil is encompassed: asses, pricks surround him every- 
where; he is frigged, fucked, tongued, sucked. 

“Ah, Juliette,” he announces once his device begins to rise, 
“Juliette, I wish to fuck your daughter.” 

Without allowing rne time to reply, the villain leaps upon her, 
has his satellites hold her for him, and embuggers her with the 
very speed of light. My poor Marianne’s shrill screams are all the 
warning I receive of the dreadful outrage perpetrated against her. 

“My stars, Noirceuil! What are you about?” 

“T am ass-fucking your child. This had to happen, did it not? 
and is it not better that it be your friend rather than some other 
who plucks the flower ?” 

After having mercilessly scraped and torn the little dear, he 
withdraws from her bleeding anus, still in possession of his 
energies; and casting haggard glances at the two harlots, he pro- 
claims his intention to sacrifice one of them. The luckless girl 


Juliette @ 1185 


clutches-his knees, implores him, fails to move him: she is seized, 
sat astride the top of a double ladder and tied fast. Noirceuil, in a 
chair placed five or six yards away, holds a cord whose other end 
is attached to the girl. Theodora and Lais, kneeling, frig his prick, 
balls, and asshole; the two cannibals fuck me within his view; the 
remaining whore is bound head downward to a stake, and in that 
awkward posture awaits events. Twenty times the rascal tugs on 
the cord, twenty times the victim comes crashing down, is set back 
upright, pulled down again, and this abominable game does not 
end until she has broken both her legs and had her skull cracked. 
These infamies having heated the libertine, he instructs an aide to 
blindfold the other whore, and decrees that each of us inflict 
several wounds upon her. The ordeal will cease when she succeeds 
in guessing the name of her aggressor: choking on her own blood, 
she collapses before she is able to identify any of the hands that 
are causing her woe. Upon Noirceuil’s orders and following a 
suggestion originating with me, these two wretches, out of whom 
not all the breath has fled, are hung up inside the chimney for a 
slow roasting above the flames and asphyxiation from the smoke. 

Drunk with lust, Noirceuil roves in a rage about the salon; 
his lunatic stares fall upon the five objects still at the disposition of 
his lewd fury: my two tribades, my daughter, and his two sons. 
Everything leads me to suspect that he is ready to immolate them 
all at once. 

“O infamy on high!” he shouts, “remove these curbs that 
make me little, when I would imitate thee and commit evil. I ask 
of thee no faculty for virtue, but canst not at least communicate to 
me thy mighty capacities for crime, and let me wreak havoc after 
thy example? Ah, dog of heaven, for one instant, if thou darest, 
put thy lightning into my hands, and once I have destroyed mortals, 
thou shalt see my loins grow gladder still as I hurl the bolt that 
blasts thy execrable existence.” 

With these words he leaps upon his son Phaon, embuggers 
him, has himself embuggered, and orders me, while I am being 
frigged by Theodora, to tear the living heart out of the child he is 
fucking, and to give it to him that he may eat it: the villain devours 
it, and at the same moment he discharges, drives a dagger into the 
breast of his other son. 


1186 <% THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


“Well, Juliette! Look, my angel, and tell me, have I not done 
a fine day’s work? Say, am I steeped enough in blood and 
atrocities ?”’ 

“You make me shudder, Noirceuil, but I imitate you withal.” 

“Think not, Juliette, that the orgy is over, nor that I am 
done.” 

His glittering eyes fall once again upon my daughter; his 
erection is that of a maniac; he seizes Marianne, has her pinioned, 
and encunts her. 

_ “By God,” he cries. “this little creature makes my head spin, 
damn me if ’tis not true. What do you mean to do with her, 
Juliette? You are not the sentimental fool, you are not the idiot 
to have feelings for this loathsome spawn of your abominable hus- 
band’s blessed testicle; sc sell her to me. Sell me the slut, Juliette, I 
wish to buy her from you; let’s both soil ourselves, you in the 
pretty sin of vending me your child, I in the still more rousing one 
of paying you only in order to assassinate her. Yes, Juliette, yes, 
let’s assassinate your daaghter’—and here he finished wiping his 
prick and nodded toward it, gleaming and purple—‘‘consider, if 
you will, how this idea inflames my senses. Stay, Juliette, have 
yourself fucked before you pronounce, answer me not till you have 
a pair of pricks in your body.” 

Crime holds no terrors for anyone when in the act of fucking; 
and one must always ponder its attractions when swimming in tides 
of sperm. Pricks penetrate me, I am fucked; a second time Noir- 
ceuil inquires to what purpose I wish to put my daughter. 

“O villainous soul!’’ I cry, loosing discharge upon discharge, 
“star of perfidy, your ascendant places all else in eclipse, smothers 
all else in me save the longing for crime and infamy. . . . With 
Marianne do you what you please, whoreson knave,” say I, beside 
myself, ‘‘she is yours.” 

No sooner does he hear these words than he decunts, takes 
hold of the poor child in his two wicked hands, and hurls her, 
naked, into the roaring fire; I step forward, and second him; I too 
pick up a poker and thwart the unhappy creature’s natural efforts 
at escape, for she thrashes convulsively in the ames: we drive her 
back, I say; we are being frigged, both of us, then we are being 


_ Juliette & 1187 


sodomized. Marianne is being roasted alive; and we go off to 
spend the rest of the night in each other’s arms, congratulating each 
other upon the scene whose episodes and circumstances complement 
a crime which, atrocious perhaps, is yet, in our shared opinion, too 
mild. 

‘So tell me now,” said Noirceuil, “‘is there anything in the 
world to match the divine pleasures crime yields ? Is there anything 
that can compete with the criminal humor? Beyond the criminal 
sensation is there anything that produces such vibrations in us ?” 

“No, my friend, not to my knowledge.” 

“Then let us live in crime forever; and may nothing in all 
Nature ever succeed in converting us to different principles. He is 
not a man to be envied who, smitten by remorse, undertakes the 
equally baneful and imprudent and needless retreat; for, irresolute, 
pusillanimous in his acts, he will be no happier in his new career 
than he was in the one he renounces. Happiness is dependent upon 
energetic principles, and there can be none for him who wavers all 
his life.” 

We spent a week at Noirceuil’s country manor and accom- 
plished a few new infamies every day. During that stay he urged 
me to try one of the passions of the Empress Theodora, Justinian’s 
wife. I lay down upon the ground ; two rustics sprinkled barleycorn 
upon my bush and upon the labia of my sex; a dozen large geese 
were brought up from the barnyard, and they began to peck at the 
seeds with their beaks, causing me such furious irritation in those 
parts that, when it was all over, I was absolutely obliged to fuck. 
Noirceuil, who had foreseen these results, presented me to fifty of 
his peasants, who performed prodigies with me. He too wished to 
try the geese; he had them feed from his ass, and afterward pro- 
claimed that an ass-pecking procured sensations keener than those 
of the whip. To these debauches he added that of ordering both 
the schoolmaster and schoolmistress of the town to furnish him 
thirty pupils of the sex each taught. He held a mixed class at his 
castle, had the little girls depucelated by the little boys; then 
finished by whipping, sodomizing, and, at last, poisoning the lot. 

“My friend,” I said to Noirceuil, “these are all trifles; can we 
not advance a step and crown our orgies by some truly brilliant 


1188 + THE MARQU:S DE SADE 


action? These townspeople have no supply of water but what 
comes from their wells; I have something of Durand’s confection 
which will envenom the entire population inside two days: between 
my women and me, we shall, I promise you, spread devastation 
everywhere.” And I was frigging Noirceuil while making that 
proposal to him. He proved unable to refuse. 

“Fuck,” was the response of the rake, helpless to contain his 
sperm at the announcement of such a scheme, “oh, by God! 
Juliette, ‘tis a very curious imagination Nature gave you. Do 
whatever you like, my angel, the floods you are milking from me 
signify my acceptance.” 

I was as good as my word. All had been stricken four days 
later: fifteen hundred souls were interred, and almost as many 
were reduced to a state of agony so dire that they were heard 
pleading for death to come. The entire disaster was attributed to 
an epidemic. The ignorance of the provincial doctors protected us 
even from suspicion; and we returned to the capital after an 
expedition which had cost us discharges beyond counting. 

Such is the happy position you see me in, my friends; I have 
a furious fondness for crime, I would not dream of pretending 
otherwise; crime, and nothing else, irritates my senses, I shall go on 
professing its maxims down to my dying hour. Exempt from all 
religious dreads, able, bv discreet procedures and my wealth, to 
avoid difficulties with the law, what is the power, human or divine, 
that could impose a check upon my desires? The past encourages 
me, the present electrifies me, and I have little fear for the future; 
and my hope is that the rest of my life shall by far surpass the ex- 
travagances of my youth. Nature created human beings to no other 
end than that they amuse themselves on earth, and make it their 
playground, its inhabitants their toys; pleasure is the universal 
motor and law, it shall always be mine. Too bad for the victims, 
victims there must be; all the world would fly to pieces were it not 
for the sublime economy that assures equilibrium; only through 
acts of wickedness is the natural balance maintained, only thereby 
does Nature recover ground lost to the incursions of virtue. Thus, 
we are obeying her wher. we deliver ourselves unto evil; our re- 
sistance thereto is the sole crime she can never pardon in us. Oh, 


Juliette & 1189 


my friends! let us take these principles well to heart; in their exer- 
cise lie all the sources of human happiness. 


Thus did Madame de Lorsange conclude the story of her ad- 
ventures, whose scandalous details had more than once wrung bit- 
terest tears from the interesting Justine. Otherwise stirred were 
the Chevalier and the Marquis; the straining and full-colored pricks 
they brought to light proved how different were the sentiments that 
animated them. They were in the midst of complotting some horror 
when a footman brought word of the return of Noirceuil and Cha- 
bert: they, the reader will recall, had been to the country for a few 
days, leaving the Comtesse to acquaint her two other friends with 
facts of which those other gentlemen had for a long time had cog- 
nizance. 

The tears which had just wet our unhappy Justine’s cheeks, 
her charming air . . . her sorrowing mien, the afflictions it told 
of; her native timidity, that touching virtuousness shadowed in all 
her features, everything about her incensed Noirceuil and the 
churchman, who must absolutely submit this luckless creature to 
their filthy and ferocious caprices. They took her off to a separate 
chamber while the Marquis, the Chevalier, and Madame de Lor- 
sange gave themselves over to other but no less bizarre, crapulous, 
lewd frolics with the numerous lust-objects which that chateau had 
in plentiful store. 

It was toward six o'clock and the day was waning when they all 
reassembled again, and deliberation was entered into regarding 
Justine’s fate. In view of Madame de Lorsange’s refusal to keep 
such a prude under her roof, the debate was whether to fling the 
poor soul out of doors or immolate her in the course of divers 
orgies. The Marquis, Chabert, and the Chevalier, more than 
sated with the creature, stood firmly for the latter alternative; 
Noirceuil, who had listened to the opinions of the others, now 
asked to be heard. 

“My friends,” he said to that joyous society, “in cases like 
the present one I have often found it extremely instructive to allow 
Nature to take her own course. There is, you have noticed, a storm 


1190 «2 THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


brewing in the sky; let us entrust this personage to the elements. I 
shall embrace the true faith if they spare her.” 

This proposal met with general acclaim. 

“I love such ideas,” said Madame de Lorsange, “‘let us carry 
it out with no delay.” 

Lightning glitters, tae winds howl, the clouds boil as though 
in a caldron, all the firmarnent is seething. One might have said that 
Nature, tired of her worxs, was readying to confound all her ele- 
ments in order to force them to adopt new forms. Justine is shown 
the door; not only is she not given as much as a penny, she is sent 
forth stripped of the litt.e that remained to her. Bewildered, hu- 
miliated by such ingratitade and so many abominations, but too 
content to escape what could have been worse still, the child of woe, 
murmuring thanks to God, totters past the chateau gates and down 
the lane leading to the highroad. . . . Scarcely does she reach it 
when a flash of lightning breaks from the heavens, and she is struck 
down, smitten by a thunderbolt that pierces her through. 

“She is dead!” cry te villains, clapping their hands and has- 
tening to where Justine lizs upon the ground. “Come quickly, Ma- 
dame, come contemplate heaven’s handiwork, come see how the 
powers above reward piety and goodness. Love virtue, we are told, 
and behold the fate reserved for its most devoted servitors.”’ 

Our four libertines surround the corpse; and although it has 
been horribly disfigured, frightful designs nevertheless shape them- 
selves in libertine minds, the shattered vestiges of the defunct Jus- 
tine become the object of lewd covetings. The infamous Juliette 
excites her friends as thev snatch the clothes from the body. The 
lightning, entering by way of the mouth, had burst out through the 
vagina; fierce jests are made upon the path by which the fire of 
heaven chose to visit the victim. 

“Yes,” Noirceuil said, ‘‘praise be to God, he merits it; there 
you have the proof of his decency: he left the ass untouched. It is 
still a beautiful thing, this sublime behind which caused so much 
fuck to flow; does it not tempt you, Chabert ?” 

And by way of reply the mischievous Abbé inserts his 
prick to the height of the balls in that lifeless hulk. His example is 
shortly followed by the others; unto her ashes they all four insult 
that dear girl, one by one; the execrable Juliette, watching them, 


Juliette & 1191 


frigs herself without pause; and finally the company retires, aban- 
doning the corpse by the wayside. Woeful and ill-starred creature, 
"twas written on high that not even the repose of death would safe- 
guard you from the atrocities of crime and the perversity of man- 
kind. 

“Truly,” declares Madame de Lorsange as the friends walk 
back to the chateau, “this most recent episode more than ever con- 
firms me in the career I have pursued up until now. O Nature!” she 
exclaimed in her enthusiasm, “‘it is then necessary to thy plan, this 
crime against which in their stupidity a multitude of fools inveigh; 
thou dost desire crime then, since thy hand punishes them who 
dread it or refrain from committing it. Oh, these late events are 
most welcome, they consecrate my happiness and perfect my tran- 
quillity.” 

Only a few moments after the party had re-entered the gate a 
coach rolled up, having arrived by a different road; it drove into 
the coyrtyard just as the five friends got there. From it stepped 
down a tall woman, very well attired; Juliette went to greet her. 

The newcomer, just heavens! was no other than Durand, the 
bosom companion of Madame de Lorsange, she whom the Vene- 
tian Inquisition had sentenced to die, and whom Juliette believed 
she had seen hanging from the ceiling in that terrible courtroom. 
“Dearest soul !” she cried, casting herself into her friend’s embrace, 
“by what stroke of fortune . . . great God, explain this to me 

. canI believe my eyes?” 

A drawing room is opened, everyone enters, sits down, and in 
silence listens while the most mysterious of adventures is clarified. 

‘““My dear Juliette,” Durand began, and her voice and manner 
were composed, ‘‘standing before you is that very one whom you 
thought done horribly to death and forever lost, and who, by dint 
of her intrigues, her industry, her knowledge, now returns in greater 
fortune and better health than ever, since over and above the con- 
siderable riches that are hers to keep she has the further happiness 
of bringing you what the authorities confiscated from you in Venice, 
Exactly, Juliette,” that loyal friend continued, depositing a large 
bundle of papers upon the table, “your fifteen hundred thousand 
livres a year are there, restored to you; that was all I was able to 
salvage; enjoy it in peace, my dear, and grant me nothing in return 


1192 e& THE MARQUIS DE SADE 


save the certitude of spending the remainder of my days in your 
society.” 

“Oh, my friends!” cried Juliette, wild from joy, “will he be 
wrong, the author who someday writes the story of my life, if he 
titles it The Prosperities of Vice? Make haste, Durand, tell us 
your wonderful tale, and be persuaded, let me say it at once, that 
tis I who beg you never again to leave us so long as you live.” 

Whereupon that forever celebrated woman, as succinctly as she 
could, informed the company that by promising to lend her services 
to the rulers of Venice, she obtained in exchange the assurance that 
another woman would be put to death in her stead, the example 
being necessary for Juliette whose properties the Council wished to 
acquire, and whose departure from the city was esteemed desirable, 
as a measure of prudence. The feint having met with complete 
success, she had then gone on to satisfy the Inquisitors, and produce 
in Venice a pestilence that carried off twenty thousand people; the 
operation terminated, she had asked, as a bonus, that her friend’s 
belongings be remitted to Aer, the request had been accorded; her 
uppermost thought was then to escape from the city without delay, 
firmly convinced that these perfidious Venetians, nourished upon 
Machiavelli’s principles, would rid themselves of their accomplice 
at the first opportunity. 

“And so I rushed hither, my dearest, in search of you,” Durand 
continued; “I contribute to your happiness, I ask no more. As do I, 
laugh at fate, which saved me twice from the gallows: assuredly, 
I was not born for the rope. What destiny holds in store for me I 
know not; but when my hour comes, let it overtake me as I lie in my 
cherished Juliette’s arms, let it be so and I shall endure death with- 
out a murmur.” 

And the two friends, clasping each other, were fifteen minutes 
exchanging avowals of the sincerest friendship, confidence, and de- 
votion which vice prizes quite as much as virtue, whatever may say 
the churlish sectators of that dismal and tedious divinity. Everybody 
was partaking in the two women’s joyous effusions when there was 
a great clattering in the courtyard as a courier from Versailles rode 
up; he asked for Monsieur de Noirceuil; and when presented to 
him, handed a sealed order to our libertine. 

“Great heaven!” the latter exclaimed, having perused the doc- 


Juliette & 1193 


ument, “it has been decreed, my dear Juliette, that every kind of 
good fortune be lavished upon us this lucky day. The minister is 
no more; here is the letter, in the King’s hand, commanding me to 
hie myself back posthaste to the Court, where I am to assume the 
reins of government. What an ocean of felicities this news promises 
us! I go up to the capital, come with me, both of you,” Noirceuil 
continued, addressing Juliette and Durand, “I want to have you by 
me forever; and indeed, how can I forego your assistance once I 
am at the helm of the ship I am about to steer! You, Chabert, I 
give you an archdiocese; Marquis, I name you Ambassador to 
Constantinople; for you, Chevalier, it’s four hundred thousand 
livres a year: you'll remain in Paris to superintend our affairs. 
Come, good friends, let us all rejoice together, from all this I see 
nothing but happiness accruing to all save only virtue—but we 
would perhaps not dare say so were it a novel we were writing.” 

“Why dread publishing it,” said Juliette, “when the truth 
itself, and the truth alone, lays bare the secrets of Nature, however 
mankind may tremble before those revelations. Philosophy must 
never shrink from speaking out.” 

The company left the following morning; greatest success 
crowned our heroes for the next ten years. At the end of that space, 
the death of Madame de Lorsange caused her to disappear from 
the world’s scene, just as it is customary that all brilliant things on 
earth finally fade away. Unique in her kind, that woman died with- 
out having left any record of the events which distinguished the 
latter part of her life, and so it is that no writer will be able to 
chronicle it for the public. Those who might care to attempt its 
reconstruction will do little else than offer us their dreams in the 
place of realities, and between the two the difference is immense in 
the eyes of persons of taste and particularly in the eyes of those who 
have found the reading of this work of some interest.
